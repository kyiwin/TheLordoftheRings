    Pipsqueak looked out from the shadow of Gandalf's bulk.  Hewondered if he was awake or still sleeping, still in the hazysomnambulant state in which he had spent most of the time since theirhasty departure from Edoras.  He blinked a few times, and tried torecall the events that had led to their journey.    The camp had been returning to sleep after Aragon had claimed thePalantarium as his own,  when a brief musical ringing sound suddenlyemanated from the artifact.  Gandalf leapt up, rigid with fear, hishands clenched.  "The Instant Messenger of Mordor!" he cried.  "Theconfiguration files are still there!"  Aragon, who had stooped toinvestigate the noise, stood and looked at Gandalf questioningly. Drawn by the commotion, others in the camp gathered round as well.    Gathering his wits, Gandalf ventured, "Aruman must have plantedincriminating evidence in the Palantarium when he held me captive, andgiven Sauron himself the means to reach me at will."  Observing thedubious looks of those around him, he rushed on.  "Clearly, the plotsof the traitor Aruman and his dark master run even deeper than wefeared.  Only haste will serve us now!  Wait not for the dawn!  Letthe swift not wait for the slow!  Act now, think later!  Run!"    As the startled riders and companions hastily broke camp in a routof confusion and began to speed off singly and in pairs toward Deem'sHelp, Gandalf grabbed Pipsqueak and tossed him onto Slimshade's back. "You looked into the stone, you're coming with me," he said, and thento himself, "Good insurance, too."  After a grunt as Gandalf settledon his back, Slimshade trotted off into the night.    All that had been many long days ago, and Pipsqueak was now evenmore tired and sore than after his run across Edoras with Cedric andClarence.  As he woke more fully, he heard Gandalf muttering angrilyat himself, and caught a few scattered phrases: "didn't even clear thebrowser history... buddy list... oh Eru, the bookmarks, too..."  Thewizard seemed thoroughly cross, and he wasn't making a bit of sense.    "What are you saying, Gandalf?" asked Pipsqueak.    "Eh, never you mind.  Now that you're awake, though, it's time tocontinue your education."  Pipsqueak groaned: early on their journey,Gandalf had become frustrated with his frequent questions, anddemanded, "What more do you want to know?"   Laughing, he hadanswered, "The names and numbers of all the girls in the Shire, andcheap sources for every popular drug, and the entire history ofMiddle-earth and Atlantis and the Far West.  What less?"    Gandalf had taken this as an invitation, and had entertainedhimself on their long ride by boring Pipsqueak to tears with historylessons. "Where did we leave off?" he now asked.  "I believe that I hadjust told you of the rise of the Stewards in Gondor, of Mardiland the founding of the University, and of his consolidation of thecopyrights of the Magic Kingdom, but I have not yet told you thatMardil was also known for his crusade against the rampant sexismof his time.  He it was who insisted on including a strong femalecharacter in every script to come out of Disgiliath, but perhapshis most lasting contribution to the status of women in Gondor wasthe unique system of matrilineal patrimony that he instituted withinhis own House.  Whereas the kingship had always passed from father toeldest son, Mardil declared that the Steward's eldest daughtershould select her own husband, who would then become the heir to theStewardship.  While not perfect, this system has succeeded inproviding Gondor with rulers who were able both to lead her armiesin battle and to cry during romantic dramas.  Of course, the systemreverts back to the old patrilineal arrangement in cases where thewife of the Steward produces no female offspring, as is for examplethe case with the children of Denethor's wife Lossiel.  A morecomplicated situation arose in the days of Turin I, whose wifedied childless..."    Unable to deal with Gandalf's constant drone, Pipsqueak becamedrowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of thecustoms of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had replaced theaging monorail loop through Edoras with a system of horse-drawncarriages to build ambiance and save on upkeep costs.  The wizard hadonce again driven the hobbit's conscious mind into complete withdrawal.As he fell slowly back into his zombie-like state, Pipsqueak had astrange feeling: he stood still like a great boulder by the sea, whileGandalf's words crashed over him like waves driven by a violent wind.    Later, whether one day or many he could not tell, Pipsqueak woke tofind himself surrounded by chill grey mists in the twilit hour beforedawn.  Still sitting behind him, Gandalf guided Slimshade along a wellbuilt wall of stone that loomed, barely visible, out of the mist totheir right.  Sensing that he had awakened, Gandalf said, "This is theWall of Lammas Ichor, the outer wall of Minas Tirith that wasbuilt after a goblin raid razed a harvest festival over a century ago. It was once quite ruinous and passable in some places, but it appearsthat the masons of Gondor have been busy since last I came thisway."  They pressed on, for Gandalf was in haste to find a section ofthe wall that was still in disrepair before the concealment of themorning mists was burned away.    After they had followed the wall for some time, the sound ofhurried labor could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, andthe curses of those who were nearly run down by carts rushing throughthe mist.  As they had hoped, the workers had not yet finished theirrepairs of the great wall, and a small section remained that was bothunwatched and tumbled down.  Slimshade climbed over the piles ofrubble, and his hoofbeats were lost in the sounds of construction. They passed now into the wide land beyond the Lammas Ichor, wherethey saw wide tilth, oasts, garners, folds, byres, a whole mess ofrills, and many other common sights of the countryside described inobscure, obsolete language.  After riding through the fields for overhalf an hour, a brisk wind from the river swept aside the mist, andPipsqueak beheld the polished walls and tall spires of MinasTirith for the first time.    For the fashion of Gondor's greatest city was such that itwas surrounded by seven walls, each of them higher and sturdier thanthe last, and soldiers patrolled the narrow aisles between them.Its streets and boulevards were built into the very slope of MountMinnie, easternmost outpost of the Off-White Mountains, andproperty values rose with every foot of elevation.  Turnstilesinnumerable guarded the road into the city, and in each of the sevenwalls was hung a great gate of stone: the only opening in those tallbattlements save where the abandoned monorail track passed through thewalls high above the ground.  As they watched, the first light of dawnshone forth and fell upon the peak of Mount Minnie, bathing it ingold, and glittered on the brightly painted towers that rose so highabove the Castle of Lornavaniwen that was carved out of themountain itself at the city's peak.  Everywhere Pipsqueak looked,Minas Tirith was immaculately clean, with every wall and windowsparkling in the new light of day.  A flowing trumpet call rang outfrom the distant castle, and at that signal, the seven gates of thecity swung open, welcoming visitors with the promise of Magic andWonder.    As sunlight illuminated the plain, Gandalf spurred Slimshade to hisgreatest burst of speed of the entire journey.  In a truly surprisingdisplay of dexterity and strength, the horse managed to leap fullacross the turnstiles despite the great weight of Gandalf on his back. As they charged on toward the great gates, men cried, "Mesprendeur! Mesprendeur!"  The gates, so newly opened for the day, began to swingclosed.    "Let me pass!" cried Gandalf.  "I must come to your Lord Denethor,to bring him council in this dark hour!  Vile rumors must be squelchedbefore they reach his ears!  Let me pass!"  The movers of the gatespaid no heed to his demanding voice, and the great stones swung closedwith resounding booms, but with a final burst of energy, Slimshadeproved the swifter, and Pipsqueak found himself gazing upon the heartof the Magic Kingdom of Gondor for the first time.    Slimshade's hooves echoed hollowly on the broad stone-paved path,laid out in enormous flat cobbles, all of them bright clean white andlaced with cheerful red veins; it was bordered by thin strips of well-trimmed grass.  Beyond them were stone pathways where lines could haveformed, and beyond them in turn were stone houses and attractions andsouvenir shops.  Stone flowerpots stood beside stone doorways and onstone windowsills.  Painted stone statues of giant, smiling animalsstood along the walkways.  Minas Tirith had an air of greatantiquity and permanence, yet in truth it was year by year fallinginto decay.  In every street they passed, some great entertainmenthall or gift shop was silent: empty, or even closed.  Over one greatgate, Pipsqueak read in strange and ancient characters the name "YeHynted Mynsion", but although the wide stone entrance spoke of greatcrowds and popularity, the courtyard was silent: there was no line.    "Is there no wood?" asked Pipsqueak.  "Nothing but stone?"  Helooked up at the roofs and walls and statues mounting up the hillsidebehind the gates: tiers of stone, painted or naturally multi-colored.    "There is wood here, and some metal," said Gandalf, "but there ismore stone.  The Atlanteans liked stone."    They rode on, drawing stares from the residents of the city, whowere unaccustomed to horses.  Indeed, a cleaning crew began to followthem up the street, pausing occasionally to scrub away any hoof marksand carrying buckets and shovels in case of emergencies.  At first themountainside loomed up far above the buildings that they passed, butas they went farther up the slope, the buildings grew taller andtaller and seemed to be part of the mountain themselves.  Finally,another gate rose up before them, the wall around it bending away toeither side until it joined seamlessly into the bedrock.  They wentthrough this gate, too, and entered a wide flat courtyard of polishedstone.  It was mirror white, and it blazed up fiercely in the earlysunlight.  Before them stood the Castle of Lornavaniwen.  Thesharp points of its turrets, brilliant as sapphires, pierced the skyfar above their heads, and tallest of all stood the Tower of Commerceitself, from which the Lord of the City could chart the course of hisfull domain.    As they gazed upon the castle, half a dozen guards appeared out ofhidden corners in the courtyard.  Their leader stepped forward, and ina cheerful but firm voice said, "No horses in the Citadel."  Pipsqueakand Gandalf were bundled to the ground, and before they knew what washappening, Slimshade had been led away.  Pipsqueak finally lowered hiseyes from the shining walls before him and beheld the ancient raimentof the Guards of the Citadel.    With its great age, Gondor had a keen sense of its own history,and a few customs were preserved that dated back to the Atlanteansthemselves.  The Guards of the Citadel traced their elitetradition back to the sailors of the famed Atlantean navy, and aloneamong the men of Gondor they continued to proudly wear the ancientuniform of their forebears.  That classic uniform of the Sea-Kings,worn by Anarchion himself, consisted in its entirety of a helm in thefashion of a blue sailor's cap adorned with a flowing black ribbon,and a bright blue sailor's shirt.    Gandalf strode quickly across the white-paved court, pushingPipsqueak ahead of him.  As they passed, Pipsqueak saw a high fountainoff to the side, splashing up against a great artificial tree coveredwith ladders, platforms, and ropes.  It seemed to be abandoned now, buthe could make out old signs sitting next to it: in cracking paint, oneof them read "Tarzan's Treehouse," while an almost entirely faded signset off to the side seemed to read, "Thy Swyss Fymily Rybinson".  Itlooked mournful, and quite dull, and as he ran before Gandalf hewondered why it was left in this place, where everything else was welltended.  He had absolutely no idea.    They walked down a long passage paved with marble, and as they wentGandalf spoke softly to Pipsqueak.  "Be careful of your words, MasterParagraph!  Denethor is a kind old man, if preoccupied with rulesand order.  I am of another sort, and I will not have your hobbitpertness spoiling my designs.  He will speak most to you, because ofwhat you can tell him of the fate of his beloved son Boromir, butunder cover of this he will seek to make you reveal more of my doingsthan I can afford.  Tell him no more than you must, and say nothingabout Aragon if you value your life."    At those words, Pipsqueak felt the cold point of a dagger pressinto his lower back.  "Why not?" he asked.  "Wasn't Strider planningto come here himself?  I thought he and HeyHoDen were just a few daysbehind us."    "Maybe, maybe," said Gandalf.  "Though if my messengers get throughin time, he may go off in a direction that no one expects.  It will bebetter so.  And if he does come, I want to herald his arrival myself." Gandalf halted before a tall door of carven stone, and he gave a cruelchuckle.  "See, Master Pipsqueak, I have already instructed you in thehistory of Gondor, and if you'd been paying attention you wouldunderstand the need for silence.  Do as I bid!"    With that, the door opened, and although none could be seen to openit, its motion was accompanied by a great squeaking sound that borelittle resemblance to the noise of ungreased hinges.  Pipsqueak lookedinto a great hall, lit by deep windows cut into the stone of thewalls, beyond the broad black marble pillars that upheld the highstone ceiling, carven in many forms dimly visible to those below.  Nohangings nor storied webs, nor any things of woven stuff or wood, wereto be seen in that long solemn hall; but between the pillars therestood a silent company of images graven in cold stone: figures clad inthe ancient mode of the kings, dressed as all manner of ducks, dogs,rodents, and caricatured humans of every description.    Suddenly, Pipsqueak recalled the great stone figures of theArgonath. "Boy," he whispered back to Gandalf, "these statues sure don'thold a candle to the great stone figures of the Argonath!"  Gandalf saidnothing, and simply pushed him forward.  At the far end of the hallupon a dais of many steps was set a stone chair, black and unadorned,and on it sat an old man gazing at his nearby desk.  At the foot ofthe dais, tucked back in a shadowed corner, was a high throne set withjewels and inlaid with finest gold, all of which seemed to be in needof polishing.  As they approached, the old man did not look up.  Inhis hand was a small white rod with a golden tip that he was tappingon the table in frustration.    "Hail, Denethor, Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith," saidGandalf.  "In this dark hour, I am come with..."    "With poor timing as usual," interrupted Denethor.  "Whenpreparing for war, the Stewards have spent the period from eight toeight thirty in the morning composing intelligence orders for time outof mind.  Walk-in audiences are not available until eleven.  But youwere never one to pay heed to courtesy."    Gandalf sighed quietly, and continued, "...with council and tidingsof war.  Is it naught to you that HeyHoDen has fought a great battle,and that I have broken the back of Aruman?  Is it naught to you thatslanderous rumors about me may already be spreading, rumors that haveabsolutely no basis in truth?  Is it naught to you that Isengard hasbeen overthrown and burned?"    "The burning that comes to my mind occurred the last time thatyou visited Minas Tirith,"  said Denethor.  "You have not beenwelcome here since then, and you are not welcome here now: if theGuard at the city gates had been following the established protocolsproperly, you would never have been able to enter my city in the firstplace.  As for your news, I know already enough regarding these deedsfor my own council.  Yea, for though the Stones be lost, or so theysay, still the lords of Gondor have better vision than lesser men. But as you have already interrupted my work, and as you have brought aguest whose news does interest me, we may as well push my breakfastback by thirty-five minutes.  Sit now!"    Pipsqueak settled onto the stool that was brought to him, but nevertook his eyes from the old lord.  Was it so, or had he only imaginedit, that Denethor had given him a big wink when he spoke of theStones?  Gandalf sat on the chair provided for him as well, but closeenough that Pipsqueak still felt the dagger poised and ready at hisback.    Turning to Pipsqueak, Denethor smiled sadly.  "Now, Paragraphson of Palatine, tell me of my son!  When did you last see him, andwhat was his fate?"    "How did you know my name?" Pipsqueak exclaimed, but Denethordid not answer.  After a moment, Pipsqueak began, "Boromir fellunder heavy assault by goblins and critics when our company wasscattered: he was surrounded alone, and my kinsman Moribund and I werecaptured when we tried to come to his aid."    "Tell me more!  Why was he alone, and how could such a great warriorand musician fall, with only goblins to withstand him?"    "The mightiest man may be slain by a knife in the gut," Pipsqueaksaid, "and Boromir had already received one from our mad cousinFrodo.  Perhaps if Aragon had stopped to help Boromir instead ofdashing off into the woods, things would have been..."    "AHEM," hacked Gandalf, pretending to cough violently while pressinghis dirk firmly against Pipsqueak's back.  Pipsqueak froze, and made ahorrible swallowing noise in his throat: "gollum".  He fell silent.    Denethor gave Gandalf a stern look, and turning back to Pipsqueaksaid, "Please, go on.  You have nothing to fear from me.  If it iseasier, tell me your full tale, from your first meeting withBoromir until his untimely death.  One who has risked his life formy son will always be a friend of Gondor."    Comforted, Pipsqueak told Denethor of their journey from Riven-dell, always inflating Boromir's role to better please the oldman.  As he described their flight from the house of Moira, he foundhimself explaining the conflict over the leadership of their company:"...and the contract clearly said that Aragon son of Arathon, the guywith the broken-reforged sword, was to..."    At that, Gandalf sprang up in fury.  "Why you little rat-sizedturncoat!" he cried, and he came at Pipsqueak with his blade bare. Pipsqueak squeaked in terror, and leaping up the dais threw himself atDenethor's feet.    "Little service, no doubt, will a great Lord of Men find in ahobbit, but what skills I have I offer now if you can save me from thismadman!"  Pipsqueak was quite impressed that he had managed toextemporize such a good speech, and he whipped out his sword andhanded it hilt-first to Denethor.    As the Steward took the weapon, he thrust it forward and facedGandalf in anger.  Gandalf stood at the base of the steps and staredintently into Denethor's eyes.  "What is this," asked Denethor,shaking his head in disgust, "some kind of juvenile staring contest? I had planned to house you and your companion somewhere that I couldhave you watched, but after this outrage in my own chambers I think Ishall have you taken to a cell instead.  The time of your audience is up,and the schedule of Gondor is mine to set, unless the king shouldcome again, along with a full set of authenticated proofs of ancestryand the appropriate forms filled out in triplicate."    "Unless the king should come again?" said Gandalf.  "Well, my lordSteward, I'll see what I can do about that.  The rule of no realm ismine, neither Gondor nor any other, but all things great or smallare within the realm that I consider my concern.  And if you think mejuvenile and no true man, I shall say only this.  By some chance, theblood of Atlantis runs nearly true in you, as it did in your sonBoromir, and yet does not in your other son, Dr Faramir.  For Ialso am a Steward.  Did you not know?"  And with that he turned andstrode swiftly forth from the hall, while Denethor stood rigid inshock with his face white and his mouth agape.  Pipsqueak's daggerfell from the Steward's trembling hand and clattered to the floor, andhe slowly sank back onto his lofty chair.    Minutes passed, and Denethor regained at least some of hiscomposure.  Finally recalling the presence of Pipsqueak, he said, "Iam sorry that you had to witness that, and I hope that it shall belong before you find yourself in such a tight corner between two suchterrible old men."  At that, he laughed wryly.  "I accept your offerof service, for the sake of my son, for your own protection, andbecause generous deeds should not be checked by cold companions. However, the proper paperwork must be filled out at once, and in anycase the time I had allotted for your morning audience has ended.  Youshall return to me soon to tell me of this Aragon and the rest of yourjourney, though after this morning's interruption it may provedifficult to find space in my schedule.  Now," he said, raising hisvoice and looking toward the alcoves about the hall, "who is the Guardon errand duty today?"    A man, clad in the blue sailor's cap and shirt of the Guard of theCitadel, stepped to the foot of the dais and bowed.  "I am, mylord.  Bererond son of Bararor, at your service."  Pipsqueak politelytried to avoid glancing below his waist.    Denethor nodded.  "This is Paragraph son of Palatine, whom Ihave taken into my service.  Escort him to the Registrar to completethe necessary documents and to be measured for his uniform, and teachhim the Grade II, III, V, and VIII.B. passwords.  You may then introducehim to our fair city, answer his questions, and show him to hisbarracks; be sure that he returns by the ninth hour of the evening. The Registrar will issue him temporary meal vouchers for use until hisforms are processed and his existing trademarks are assumed."  He thenturned to Pipsqueak, and returning to him his sword, said, "Farewell,my liege, and I hope to soon hear your tale in full."    Bererond led Pipsqueak to the quarters of the Guard, and after theycompleted the lengthy application and registration process they had alate lunch in one of the private "cast members only" cafeterias thatlooked out over the great stone gates of the city.  Pipsqueak learnedmuch from Bererond about Minas Tirith's culture, its nightlife,and its people, and Bererond was pleased to learn that Pipsqueak hadconnections that might be able to supply much of the Guard's need forblack market drugs and alcohol.  Beyond the stone roofs of the city,they gazed out over the tilth within the Lammas Ichor, upon thepitifully small crowd gathered to watch the cowboys performing theirtwice-daily rodeo at the Pelennor Fields, and along the long, dustyroad that led from the great gates into the south.    "That is the road to the potato vales of Tubeladen and Lotstarch,and the mountain hollows, and then on to Lebanon and the fields of thesouth," explained Bererond.  Then, in a darker tone, he went on, "FromLebanon yestereve came evil tidings of a great fleet approaching themouths of Anduin, manned by the Tampalas Bay Corsairs.  Our great fearis that this attack will inspire local riots and draw off much of thehelp that we looked to have from Lebanon and Belfast, where folk areswarthy and expendable.  All the more are we troubled by the conflictin Edoras, and the tidings of inexplicable battle that you bring."    "I am no warrior," said Pipsqueak, "and I dislike any thought ofbattle or its causes.  No stroke would have been struck in Rohan, Ithink, but for Gandalf.  But look!  What is that dust that I see inthe distance, far down the road?"    "Rightly said!" cried Bererond once he had spied the distant cloudhimself.  "The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Roadere sundown.  Come, let us make our way to the great gate before thecrowd forms."    Before long, they found themselves in a throng going toward theentrance to the city, filled with worried citizens of Minas Tirithwho deeply needed this boost to their morale.  When they reached thegates, Pipsqueak and Bererond spoke their names and various Grade IIIpasswords, and they were given stamps on their wrists and allowed tofind a better vantage point in the great stone-paved space beyond theturnstiles into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran.  All eyeswere turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose as the dust kicked upby the approaching reinforcements drew nearer.    "Forlong!  Forlong!" Pipsqueak heard men calling.  "What does itmean?" he asked.    "Forlong has come," Bererond answered, "old Forlong the Fat, theLord of Lotstarch, home of my father.  Hurrah!  Here he is.  Good oldForlong!"    Out of the dust, there came walking a big, thick-limbed horse, andon it sat a big, thick-limbed man of huge girth.  He was clad in mailand wore a black helm, and he bore a long, heavy spear.  "Forlong!" menshouted.  "True heart, true friend!  Forlong!"    Behind him, the dust settled.    The onlookers stood silent for a while.  The wind had died, and theevening was heavy, and for some this made the shock of disappointmenttoo much to bear: first one, and then another of the onlookers satdown where he was and began to cry quietly.  Eventually, the crowdbegan to wander listlessly back into the city, though it seemed thatsome crept instead away toward Minas Minnie and the hills.Pipsqueak thought he heard one of these men mutter, "Gondor shall notperish yet!  Hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valleywhere the grass is green... and I'm gonna get there while the gettin'sgood."    As they trudged back up to the barracks, Pipsqueak and Bererondwere silent, each lost in his own thoughts.  Bererond showed him to hisnewly assigned bunk.  "It is a black night," he said, "and the end ofa black day.  We can only hope that things will look brighter in themorning.  Wake early, for you will be summoned before the second hourto the Lord Denethor to receive your permanent assignment with theGuard.  Farewell, and sleep in peace!"    The barracks were dark as Pipsqueak climbed into his bed to settlein for the evening.  Gloom settled still more heavily on him, for hewas alone in a strange city and was soon to be thrust into the terribleheat of war.  For a while he lay and listened to the sounds of theother Guards breathing and tossing in their sleep, and then he joinedthem in their uneasy slumber.    In the night he was wakened by a dim light above him: Gandalf hadcome and was leaning over the bed with a pillow poised above Pipsqueak'sface.  "I have come for you here," said the wizard in an almostinaudible whisper, "for I must have a little peace to work in thiscity, alone.  I cannot leave you to do any more damage than you havealready done.  I hope you have enjoyed this night, Paragraph Took! There will be no dawn."
  Isen riverrun, past HeyHoDen, son of Thengel, son of Fengel, son ofFolcwine, son of Folca, son of Walda, relative of Fluffy, and his nephewEonard, canard sans cojones, unpuissant in battle, at the sight of arrowrainfrom bow an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings, and his niece Eowynn,blonde and nubile and never been kissed in the grass ho ho;  now wondering what to do to get rid of his gluttonous guest Aragon as thecompany rode south from the ruin of Isengard, musing how his longfather Yorl(Mercy an his mummery!) Offa'ed the Orcs at the point of time when they wereabout to overprune their eeniemice in Minas Mickey, his thoughts perkelatingthrough his brain in slow curses and screams when a Rider galloped up fromthe rear of their line.  "My lord," he said to the king, "there are horsemen behind us. As wepassed the Fords I thought that  I heard them. Now we are sure. They areovertaking us, riding hard."  "If we can aFord the Isen, so can they," mused the king(ababbababbarubbalubbafubbaoutoifideasyougulliblesassenachfool), and hecommanded everybody to wait. But their pursuers were merely some thirty orso of Aragon's kinsmen from the north, led by one herosuiticalAtlantidiniophobet yclept Halberd; and with them also rode the sons of ElRond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, thirsting to revenge their mother (whose namewas a matter of debate) for her long, slow torment in the concert halls ofthe Orcs as they forced her to listen to the works of Hindemuzgash,Mahlerhúr and Smaughausen. Everybody in the company was gay at the meeting,and the king reJoyced at the news of who they were.  "Now that you have your own outfit, I suppose you will ride your separateway?" he said to Aragon.  "Indeed I am," responded Aragon. "I know you will dawdle here for quitesome time under the pretext of mustering your Riders; but I am in a hurryand will take the Paths of the Living."  "Really?" inquired HeyHoDen with raised eyebrows. "Are you sure that is agood idea?"  "The best," answered Aragon firmly.  "Well, have it your own way," said HeyHoDen. "But do ride with us toDeem's Help first for a barbecue. We will see you off in style."  "Thank you, lord; you are most gracious," drooled Aragon.  "Perhaps we will meet again," said Eonard without much enthusiasm.  "We may," said Aragon.  So they arrived at Deem's Help, and the Dunlendish slaves fried hamburgersfor their betters, who while waiting to get served watched the highly exoticdancing of a dusky beauty from Harad called Ostrich Flame.  When the food was served, Aragon devoured it and asked for more whilecomplaining of the poor fare. "What I wouldn't do for a proper tikkamasala!" he groaned as he wolfed down his tenth cheeseburger.  "What are the Paths of the Living?" asked Giggly with his eyes avertedfrom the gross sight of the slavering, chomping Aragon.   "Thus spoke Malcolm the Seer, in the days of Ar-vegetal, last king ofFornost," said Aragon:    The statue's nose has a round black tip,    and westward points its four-fingered hand.    The Tower trembles; to the amusement parks    mice are approaching. The ducks awaken;    for the hour is come for the cartoon creatures;    at the Stone of Elmer they shall stand again.    and hear quacks of a bird in the hills raging    Who shall awake them? Who shall call them    from the grey twilight, the forgotten people?    The heir of him to whom the franchise was given.    From the North he shall come, greed shall drive him:    He shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Living  "And what paths are those?" asked Lego-lass.  "Simply a shortcut thrugh the Off-white Mountains that the Rohirrim avoidbecause they find the toll excessive," answered Aragon. "But Elendil's Heirtravels there for free."  "Hey, cool!" said Giggly. "Look, one of Isildur's original collaboratorswas a Dwarf called Harry Cohn. I am collaterally descended from him. Can Ihave a cut?"  "Surely," said Aragon. "No show is complete without a Dwarf."  After the meal, HeyHoDen summoned the pathetic, ragtag Rohan peasant army.Grouching "What is it now?" "My arse is sore from the saddle!" and thelike, they reluctantly shuffled closer and formed ragged lines. HeyHoDenlooked keenly on them, and with a slight, wry smile he said:  "The people of Rohan were always numerous, but ofttimes their bravery hasbeen less impressive than their numbers. However, to encourage you I haveretained a few Orkish whipmen, who by joining our side have proved that allOrcs are not evil, despite racist claims to that effect. Húberz, Húmfrkh,Snagfred - keep an eye on them! Where there is a whip there is a will."  A number of Orkish overseers in public school uniforms walked forward andsaluted the king with their whips.  "Together we shall attain glory!" shouted HeyHoDen with glaring, insaneeyes. "The victory and the power shall go to Minowara blood, Minnehahablood, Minotaur bood! Oh, Aragon-san, what a future I have planned for you!"Suddenly, HeyHoDen's red, glazed eyes focused. He shook his head, lookingslightly embarrassed.  "Sorry about that," he said. "But that pipeweed the halflings taught me tosmoke really is good stuff."  And now Aragon sat up on his great big harse. But lo! His massive weight,augmented by unnumbered hamburgers and Frankfurter sausages, was too muchfor his steed; its legs folded like boiled spaghetti and it hit the groundwith a crash, instantly killed by the oppressive weight on its back. A moanof despair arose from the Rohirrim, whose larders were already depletedbecause of this man.  "How fortunate that I can amend this!" said HeyHoDen with a tight smile."I received a gift from Denethor last year and have kept it stabled here atDeem's Help for the fertilizer." At a sign from him, two servants ran offand returned with a huge mûmak.  "This is Babar, named for the fabled oliphaunt king of old," declaredHeyHoDen, "and this is my parting gift to you. May it carry you far!"  Aragon bowed and sat up. For a moment the mûmak reeled under his weight,but it recovered. Its small eyes looked unhappy, but apart from a bit ofear-flapping it did not object to the inhumane treatment it was beingsubjected to.  Now everybody took an enthusiastic farewell of the company. The field wasfull of people waving good-bye: Rohirrim, Dunlendings drafted into the Rohanarmy on an affirmative action quota programme they would gladly haveabstained from, Ments, Ents, Ments disguised as Orcs, Orcs disguised asMents, Ments disguised as Ents - everybody cheered at the company'sdeparture, and indeed, grateful they were to be rid of someone with Aragon'sinsatiable appetite ("another week and he would have eaten me out of mykingdom!" sighed HeyHoDen to Eonard).  And while HeyHoDen went by slow paths in the hills, the Gay Company passedswiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came toEdoras, where Aragon had a spot of trouble persuading Eowynn not to jointhem. However, the welding torch-like glare from Arwen's eyes clearly showedthat this was the politic thing to do.  "Fear not, sugarpuss," whispered Aragon to Eowynn when Arwen happened tolook away for a moment. "When this is over I will make you a greater starthan Shelob herself, for I mean to restore the Gondor entertainmentindustry to its old glory." Eowynn bit her lip and stared sourly at theground, but she had to rest content with this promise.  When the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risenabove the high ridges in the East, Aragon made ready to depart. He and thosewith him rode away without anyone bidding them farewell, for Eowynn wassulking in her rooms and her folk did not wish to encourage any furthertardiness from their guests. (Aragon's evening meal and breakfast hadconsumed all the food they had meant to bring to their wartime refuge in thehills.)  So they came to the Door to the Paths of the Living. Above its wide archwas a rim of merrily shining red lightbulbs, and jazz music flowed from itlike the screaming of tortured Nazdaq.  "This is a tasteless door," said Halberd, "and I hate jazz music. I willpass it nonetheless; but does anyone have earstoppers?"  No one did. They entered on a file, leading their horses. (The mûmak Babarlet out a huge gust of relief as Aragon sat down from it, and meeklyfollowed him under the arch.) An aged ticket collector ambled forwards, butlooking at Aragon he fell back again and saluted him by snapping his fingersand doing a moonwalk. Aragon had brought torches from Edoras, and now hewent ahead bearing one aloft; and Al Ladan with another went at the rear,and beside him walked Giggly and Lego-lass, rubbernecking. Most of theattractions (apart from a few nightclubs and gambling dens) were closeddown, but the magic of the place had kept them spotless and shining; theylooked as if they could open at any moment and take admission fees forvisiting Queen Berúthiel's Tea Party, Bottle and the Booze or Cindy Reela'sgingerbread house.  No barker accosted the company, nor withstood their passage, and yetsteadily grew the curiosity of the Dwarf as he went on, most of all becausehe itched to learn how many marks the various outfits had fleeced on anormal business day. So time unreckoned passed, until Giggly beheld a mostcurious sight. The road was wide, but now the company came suddenly into agreat empty space, and there were no longer  any walls upon either side. Thegreed was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk onwards. Away to theleft something glittered in the gloom as Aragon's torch drew near. ThenAragon halted and went to look what it might be. Giggly, who smelled gold,followed him at once, and Lego-lass trailed after him.  Aragon kneeled while Al Ladan held aloft both torches. Arwen crossed herarms and gazed at it all with a sort of amused disdain. Before them were thebones of a mighty man. He had been clad in mail, and still his harness laythere whole; but his shoulders and head were in little pieces that seemed tobe slowly growing together. As Giggly watched, two bits of throat meltedtogether with a small hissing sound.  "This looks like Boromir," said Aragon thoughtfully. "He must have beenbrought here by some kind of tremendous explosion, transmitted here throughspace and time."  "That sounds very far-fetched," remarked Giggly.  "Not at all!" declared Aragon. "Fredric Brown uses precisely that idea ina science fiction story of his called 'What Mad Universe'  a gloriousread!"  "Do you like science fiction?" exclaimed Giggly; a smouldering fire was inhis eyes. "I had no idea! I like Brown, but I prefer Clifford Simak and PoulAnderson."  "I am more of the hardscience Asimov or Heinlein school," said Aragon."Have you read the Foundation trilogy?"  "My lord Aragon, please!" objected Halberd. "This is hardly the place forthis kind of discussion, is it?" Aragon and Giggly looked at each other.  "I suppose not," said Aragon with a sigh. "But had I but known this duringall those boring evenings... well, let's look at Boromir. All the pieces seemto have grown together now."  "He was in one piece when we last saw him," remarked Lego-lass.  "True. True," said Aragon with a sligtly shifty look. "Well, let's turnhim over." He did so and exclaimed: "He has no face!"  "And it does not look as if it's going to grow back," remarked Giggly,peeking through Aragon's armpit. "I wonder why?"  "Perhaps it got stuck somewhere," said Aragon. "But never mind! Rememberthat 'the hands of the King are the hands of a healer'! We'll bring him backto life and give him a new face."  "Can we really do that?" asked Giggly.  "Oh, definitely! These are the Paths of the Living. Open that door behindhim, Halberd."  Halberd obeyed his command. The two men entered the room behind andreturned, wheeling and carrying various items of medical apparatus. Togetherwith Giggly and Lego-lass they donned surgical clothing that Giggly hadfound, placed Boromir on a bed with castor wheels and assembled around it.After a brief fight over the scalpels between Arwen and Lego-lass they wereall set.  "Give him 40 cc of Nauglamirin!" commanded Aragon. Halberd obeyed.  "Give him 220 volts!" Giggly stepped forward and sadistically applied theshock.  "He is breathing!" reported Lego-lass.  "Ready to electrocute his penis," said Aragon.  "Pardon?" said Giggly.  "Oh... ah... er.., I mean 'Ready to intubate'," said Aragon with a slightblush.  After twenty minutes of hard work Boromir was alive and breathing, andwould no doubt have had rosy cheeks if he had been in possession of a face.  "And now for a face!" said Aragon merrily. "Behold, I am the renewer!" Heplaced both hands on Boromir's head and kneaded it until a howl suddenlyburst from the recumbent warrior. Aragon snatched back his hands andexclaimed: "Behold my handiwork!"  The others looked and gasped. Boromir had indeed received a new face. Ithad a long nose with a round black knob at its end; huge upper teethprotuded from his mouth, and he had long, hanging black ears. He also seemedto have acquired a blue cap that rose from his crown like a little tower.  "I will restore Minas Tirith to its ancient glory, such as it was when itwas known as Minas Mickey and faced Minas Goofy across the River!" declaredAragon. "And who better to start with than the beloved son of StewardDenethor?" He laughed aloud, a laughter with certain sinister overtones:"Hnyukyukyuk!" The others stared, frozen with shock. Even Giggly, thegreediest of Dwarves and hardened by many shady deals, was taken aback.  Arwen sucked in her breath with a soft hiss. "Aren't you going a bit toofar?" she whispered to Aragon. He looked innocently at her and then winked.  Boromir opened his eyes and asked: "Where am I?"  Halberd licked his lips. "In the Paths of the Living," he said.  "Is my face here too?" asked Boromir. "I seemed to lose it  but no, itwas just an evil dream."  "You have got a new face," said Halberd in a choked voice. He polished hisshield with his sleeve and held it up as a mirror before Boromir, wholooked at the reflection.  "GAWRSH!" he exclaimed. They all waited, Aragon expressionless but theothers in some trepidation. Boromir looked intently at his reflection andmade a deep, clunking sound in his throat.  "I like it!" he declared. They all breathed out, except Aragon, who smiledand discreetly put away a knife he had been holding.  "This is but a token of things to come!" he said. "Soon we will be out ofthe passage. Lead the way, friend Boromir!"  Soon they were indeed out of the tunnel and came into the clear friendlysunshine. They marched onwards, accompanied by an ever growing flock ofcheering funlovers. At the head of the Gay Company danced Boromir, singing:  Aragon, Arathon's son, riding on Babar!  Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee!Seated on his only slightly groaning mûmak, Aragon threw chocolate coins tothe multitude, who fell on their knees in the dust exclaiming "He'sgenerous! So generous!" Wherever they came the enemies of Gondor screamedand fled, for they worshipped film noir and other black arts, but the commonpeople gathered around the Gay Company, and joy and merriment followed them.

It's so simple that even a MORON could figure it out.Eonard (wrestling with map while the army looks on, confused):  Gosh darn it,does ANYONE know to fold this thing back up?HeyHoDen: (dead-pan, to camera) At least we know he's no moron.--------------------------------------------------Scene 2: A Long-Expected Party Line[While HeyHoDen and Eonard ride towards Dunhero at the head of the army, Morriefollows closely behind, talking incessantly, filling King HeyHoDen's ears withtales of his rebellious hobbit youth -- his nightly soirees of cow-tipping, ofegging Farmer Maggot's house, of spray-painting "Fatty Bolger Lives" on thesides of the mill as the sheriff hallooed and hallayed after them.]Morrie: (chortling) ...And THEN there was the time I stole some of Gandalf'sfireworks, drained out the powder, and stuffed it all into the bowl of the OldGaffer's pipe!

Our hunchbacked groundskeeper insists oncutting them, though, and because it keeps him from eating live gophers out onthe ninth green, we tolerate it.

But while some facilities cater only to the rich andfamous, here at Dunhero, we don't take anyone but the very best -- even ifthey're Maiar in disguise![Both men turn and smile cheesily into the camera.]Alatar: (speaking to camera) Hi! I'm Alatar!Pallandro: And I'm Pallandro. While we made the cut, our friend Olorin -- orGandalf -- bombed out big-time.Alatar: He was plain bad.Eonard: (off-camera) What? Gandalf's evil?Alatar: (whacking Eonard off-camera with his staff) No, young fool, just bad. Aterrible wizard. No stage presence, couldn't do a trick to save his life.Pallandro: (nodding) Always dropping his marked deck, or sneezing from rabbitspoor left in his hat, or forgetting the magic words of power.Eonard: (off-camera) What words? Alakazam? Hocus pocus? Elbereth Githoniel?Pallandro: No, "Cash in Advance," dolt. (He whacks Eonard on the headoff-camera, then sighs.) But he only has himself to blame. After flubbing theold "Saw the Elf Maiden in Half" trick down in a Lothlorien nightclub, he lostmost of his bookings. Poor Lustianne just fell to pieces...[There are loud gasps from off-camera.]Eonard: But we thought she died of grief over Bluto's death, from theslipcasts!Alatar: (whacking Eonard on the head again off-camera) Oh, Olorin's changed hisstory AGAIN, has he?Pallandro: For centuries, it was, "She just stepped out for a smoke, officer,and then I just found her like this in the parking lot." What audacity.Alatar: The old goat. He tried to steal my peanuts on the flight over from theBlessed Realms too, you know, while I was in the lavatory. And when we playedpoker, he would always bid things like, "Ruling the world," or "Making cookiesout of Girl Scouts." Don't trust Olorin any farther than you can throw him,unless you're throwing him into the Cracks of Doom.Pallandro: I never understood what Sauron saw in him anyway.Alatar: That degree from Cambridge, no doubt. It impresses everyone.Eonard: (off-camera) SAURON??! The BURNING EYE of MORDOR?Pallandro: (whacking Eonard on the head with his staff) What is this moviebecoming, a commercial for organic food?Alatar (to Pallandro): Well, it's quite good -- the Burning Eye eggs are whatgot me hooked, remember?Pallandro: I was always partial to his fresh produce. But at least he's done alot for agriculture in Mordor.Eonard: (off-camera) What? Mordor's all desert! Wasteland! Parking lots!Alatar: (whacking Eonard on the head off-camera) Only from years of Gondor'smine-stripping the countryside. Rainforests take some time to spring back. Eonard: (off-camera) Sauron is trying to conquer Middle-Earth and enslave itspeople!! Uncle, tell them!HeyHoDen's (off-camera): Hey, I never met the guy.Alatar: Sauron was the nicest young lad.Pallandro: Worked in his garden all day, bare-footed, piling weeds for compost.When Galadriel Seeds, Inc., took off a few years back, he wrestled with usingpesticides or artificial fertilizer but never gave in, as he was concernedabout the effects on the water table and food chain.Eonard: (stepping on camera, with two black eyes) Look, can you just turn thatthing OFF? (He faces the old wizards.) We're talking about Sauron here.SAUR-on! Destroyer of Middle-Earth. Kicker of Puppies. Writer of Parodies.Thawer of Ice Cream. Eater of Babies.Alatar (to Pallandro): I hear he's a vegetarian now.Pallandro: I believe it. If there's one thing you can say about Sauron, it'sthat he can't stand to see anyone suffer.[There's a stunned pause as Eonard's pupils dilate and drool drips down hischin. Then both men begin cackling insanely.]Pallandro: (unable to breathe from laughter) Hee hee! Just kidding!Alatar: What a look on the kid's face! It gets them every time!Pallandro: "Vegetarian!" Oh PLEASE...!Alatar: I thought the mine-stripping was a beautiful touch, myself...Dunfore: (overdub) When your old men start acting funny, don't send them downthe Anduin in a flaming boat without oars -- send them to Dunhero!

The door slams shut.]Eonard: But she said she was going to the mall, to mock those who had lessmoney and less expensive designer clothing! Like, sure!HeyHoDen (pounding on door): Come out of there! Come out of there at once,young lady!Eowynifred (muffled): No!HeyHoDen: You're making a fool of yourself on the Usenet!Eowynifred: I don't care!HeyHoDen: That's it! You're grounded!

And forbidden tosee Wormtongue ever again!Eowynifred: BUT I LOVE HIM FATHER![big pause as everyone looks at each other]HeyHoDen: (sheepishly) By Eorl's golden chamberpot, I have no clue how torespond to THAT one.--------------------------------------------COMMERCIAL: Dwarf Acrobatic TeamDunfore (overdubbed): Here at Dunhero , we're not just any old retirement home.There's always things to do and new skills to learn, even if you're as old asEl Rond without a face lift![Block letters on screen: DWARF ACROBATIC TEAM]Dunfore: Most long-bearded dwarves take up rappelling, but why limit yourself?[Camera cuts to eight wrinkled dwarves who dive and roll around the gymnasium,wearing spandex shorts and tank tops, to the throbbing beat of Boy George's"I'll Tumble For You."]All Dwarves: Hi! Ho! Yippee-Hi-Ho![One at a time, each somersaults by the eye of the camera as way ofintroduction, then vaults up into a precarious pyramid formation.]Dwarf 1: I'm Balin!Dwarf 2: And Ori!Dwarf 3: Oin!Dwarf 4: Thror!Dwarf 5: Durin!Dwarf 6: He's Gropey!Dwarf 7: He's Dumpy!Dwarf 8: And I'm Percival!All Dwarves: And We! Are! The Dwarf Acrobatic Team![They hold the formation for all of three seconds before Ori farts, then rollsover convulsing in laughter. The pyramid collapses.]Balin: Okay. Break for ten.[Dwarves grab towels, six-packs of Michelob, and Cuban cigars, and head for thesauna.]HeyHoDen: (sounding very much like he's reading from a cue card) As King ofRohan and a perennial lover of horses, I must say that I respect the talents ofthese skilled performers --Eonard (off-camera): But Uncle, didn't you used to say that dwarves tumble bestwhen pushed off a high cliff?HeyHoDen (whacking Eonard off-camera with flat of sword): -- and I look forwardto the many recreational activities that Dunhero has to offer old fogies likeme.Dunhero: When your hero days are done, be a zero just for fun.---------------------------------Scene 7: Everyone All Caught Up[With tempers cooled, Morrie locked in Day Care, the lovers out of the closet,Wormtongue duct-taped to the futon, Eonard making himself a Burning Eyeegg-cram-liverwurst sandwich, no more infomercials being filmed, and HeyHoDenwondering why it was so hard to fake his own death like everyone else andretire secretly in peace, everyone spent some time catching up.]Eowynifred: (repeated for the fiftieth time, as she brushes her hair and fixesher smudged makeup) But are you SURE he's DEAD?HeyHoDen: (crossing his fingers) Yes.Eonard: But that makes no sense, the Door didn't lead to the Paths of the DEAD,it led to the Paths of the LIVING --HeyHoDen: Silence, varlot, he is DEAD DEAD DEAD! [The bathroom door opens, and out comes Thror of the Dwarf Acrobatic Team,wrapped in a towel.]Thror: (gruffly) Hope you don't mind, but I borrowed your nail clippers to trimmy eyebrows. By the way, someone left this on your pillow.[He hands HeyHoDen a small card that says, simply, "No, he's not, he's ALIVE!"]Eonard: (curious) Didn't that come with any chocolates or mints or something?The maid's supposed to leave chocolates or mints.[Thror belches loudly in Eonard's face in response, then goes back into thebathroom.]HeyHoDen: (tossing the card in the trash so no one can see it) If old talesspeak truly, none have ventured the Paths of the Living since Balderdash, sonof Brillo, was thrown through that Door and had it barred and mortared shutbehind him, to never be seen among men again -- not even after electionofficials removed that seal eighty years later to hide ballots from Palm Beachwithin its dark tunnels.Eowynifred: Then why would Aragon even go that way?Wormtongue: (still tied up) To win the election for Al Gore?Eonard: No one knows the purposes of the insane.Eowynifred: (bitter) Greatly changed was that man since last I saw him in theKing's house -- a pathetic fool, lost in delusions of grandeur, unable toaccept the honest love of a passionate, intelligent, beautiful woman with goodhair, one who loved him desperately and would have done anything he wanted,literally ANYTHING, if only he would have taken her within his strong armsand... [She trails away as she realizes everyone else is staring at her.]Eowynifred (waving a fist in the direction of the Door): FIE ON THEE, mayestthou rot in the depths of HELL forever for thy scorn! Err, I really mean that.[There is a long pause.]Wormtongue: So you were just using me. Eowynifred: (nodding) Yeah. Yeah, you were my rebound. Are you angry?Wormtongue (after a very long pause):  Well, as long as we're on the same page,how about one more rebound for the --HeyHoDen: (interrrupting) While my heart tells me loudly that we won't beseeing anything of Lord Aragon again, yet he was kingly, and knew how to lordit like a king over us! So take comfort in this tale, DAUGHTER..It is said that when Brillo and Balderdash had climbed the stair to the Door,upon its threshold sat a man begging for cigarettes and cheap whiskey, agedbeyond years -- once tall and strong but now as withered as Jesse Helms, andjust as fit to retire.And this man looked as gray as week-old tuna and said no word until they triedto pass him and enter, and then a voice came from him, and it was the voice ofBarry White but with a semi-passable Scottish brogue, and it said, 'This wayyou shall not pass, ach, yes, not unless you tell me what I've got in mypockets.'And so they halted and stared, and they saw that he was an eccentric old manwith tobacco-stained teeth and a face like a smelt."Hands!" exclaimed Balderdash, which the old man had just wisely slipped outbefore he could be caught by such a foolish answer."'The way is shut," repeated the old man, "and so shall its secrets be hiddenuntil the riddle is answered.'Resigning himself to having to slip the man a ten-note to find out somethinguseful, Brillo replied, "So, when will that time be?"But no answer did he get, for the old man suddenly died and toppled forwardwith Balderdash's dagger within his back, and then they searched his pocketsand found nothing but a pocketknife and some old string, which wasn't what hehad led them to believe with his riddle, but there was nothing to be done aboutit at that point except prop him back up against the rock and pretend thatnothing had happened at all.Wormtongue: (curiously) You know, that reminds me a great deal of what happenedto old man Marley, the polo bookie, back at Meduseld last year --Eonard: (a bit too quickly) Alas, that such fey moods fall upon kings in theirhour of need! Wormtongue: But --Eonard: Shut UP. I never liked you anyway.Wormtongue: Look, I realize you've always hated me because I'm smarter than youand because I know where your sister's bikini lines stop --Eonard: YARG!Wormtongue: -- but I'm really a neat person.Eonard: And what does that mean? You've learned how to fold your own laundryand put it away?Wormtongue: I've never been thrown from a horse.Eonard: And never eaten one, either, I'll bet.Wormtongue: But I've read all sorts of books and know all kinds of usefulthings!Eonard: Except whether or not elves have pointy ears and balrogs actually havewingsWormtongue: I can show you how to figure out who's going to win the secondseason of Big Brother.Eonard: Who cares?Wormtongue: (lowering his voice) I can tell you how to become king in less thana week.Eonard: (one eye flickering over to HeyHoDen) Okay, I'm listening. [As Eonard pulls up a chair, suddenly from outside is a loud sound.]HeyHoDen: Hark! What is THAT loud sound?Balin: (shouted from bathroom) Might be room service -- we've got steaks andsuds comin'!Eowynifred: No, look, there! Outside! A mob!HeyHoDen: Well, give Gandalf a wedgie, it IS a mob. (Looks at watch) And righton time! (Throws open shutters) Greetings, pigs, err, loyal subjects! Art thouprepared to leave?[There's the staccato sound of projectiles hitting the wall, and an arrowsuddenly shishkabobs Wormtongue through the head, just like the old SteveMartin schtick.]Wormtongue: Ouch.HeyHoDen: (slamming the window) Perhaps they'd like to stay the night?Eowynifred: (peering through glass) No doubt the peasants are angry that we'vehad our cake and eaten theirs too. They seem mostly focused on the sodamachines and the Hostess truck parked behind the kitchen. Perhaps while theytry to eat their way through tons of tempered steel in their insatiable questfor food, we could flee!HeyHoDen: (glancing at Wormtongue) I cannot argue, for there 'tis the Red Arrowsticking through my ex-counselor's head, and when the Red Arrow appears inRohan, it has long been our tradition, from my father and his father beforehim, to ride like hell out of there. So to Gondor, and away! Ride!Eonard: But uncle, we cannot go to Gondor, Lord Denethor expects us with anarmy! We have no army now!HeyHoDen: (peeking back out through the window at the mob) How about the onethat might be right on our heels?Eonard: Uncle!HeyHoDen: (deciding) Lord Balin, would you care to join the heroes of Rohan forone last quest to rid Middle-Earth of evil and thus allow future generations ofdwarves and Rohanese to meet together upon the field of battle and knock eachother senseless for the rights to deforest Fangorn's green woods?Balin: Look, HeyHoDen, I like you and all, and you've got a decent beard for ahuman, but the "Fighting the Dark Lord" thing doesn't cut it anymore. Just notfulfilling. I'm retired, and life is too short to be wasted on such joylesspursuits.HeyHoDen (slyly): There's gold involved. Lots of it.Eonard: But Uncle, the royal treasury has been emptied -- (HeyHoDen slaps himalongside the head) -- err, for spring cleaning.HeyHoDen: With the Gondor army distracted by Nazgul lords and the assault onthe main gate, I'd bet a seasoned contingent of dwarves could bust through theranks and plunder most of the High Court before anyone caught on.[Big pause as the dwarves look amongst themselves. Then they break into song.]Dwarves: We ride! Ho! Kill the men, kill the elves, save the gold forourselves! HeyHoDen, let's go!Eonard: But Uncle, I thought we were friends with the Stewards of Gondor. HeyHoDen: Years ago, they whipped us in the Pinewood Derby, son. Now it'spayback time.[And so, away from the burning food courts and landing pads of Dunhero, wherethe soiled and starved faces of the peasantry looked out from their sewerholes, on horseback and in stolen golf carts, King HeyHoDen, his nephew, thedazed ex-counselor, and the Dwarf Acrobatic Team did ride towards Gondor, theCity of Gold, and without horn or harp or any real semblance of melodic refrainor consistent tempo did break into this very song!]     To Dunhero came our done hero     to set up house and fake his death     To hang the horse, kick off the boots     and enjoy his retirement!     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     The great escape is sure to chaff     his skin as he to Gondor rides!     Raw knees! (Raw knees!)     Raw knees! (Oh please!)     The peasants eat the rocks and trees     as HeyHoDen to Gondor flees!     He cannot leave his friend to smolder     nor give Gondor to its foe!     With dwarves balanced on head and shoulder,     HeyHoDen rides to save the gold!     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     His long rapport with Denethor     demands he ride to watch him die      Rawdeal! (Rawdeal!)     Rawdeal! (Rawdeal!)     Dreams of revenge are soon to hinge     on dwarf gymnastics far afield!     Rawfish! (Rawfish!)     Raw --PRODUCER: CUT! CUT! WE LOST OUR LEASE! SHUT IT DOWN! SHUT IT *ALL* DOWN!Writer: But --Producer: Sorry. You there, throw out those stale Twinkies; this picture's awrap.Writer: (whining) But it's not done! We have three more pages to go and RichardDreyfuss is still in day care --[Doors slam. Lights go out. Crickets chirp. All that is left is a bare table, anumber #2 pencil, an Olympia typewriter, and a spittoon. The writer sighs andsits at the table, then types out the last pages of narrative, this time innovel form.]LAST SCENE: HOW MORIBUND CAN YOU GET?Morrie had quickly tired of day care and of the large diapers he had beenforced to wear, and although the teachers would toss him small bits of crackerand gumdrops if he would but gurgle and coo and stick plastic keys deep intohis mouth, he soon felt quite sick to his stomach."They have all left now," he grumbled. "Gandalf and Pipsqueak, Frodo and Sam,HeyHoDen and Eonard, even the audience! And my turn will come soon enough, if Iam continued to be fed so poorly. What I need now is some REAL grub."And so Morrie killed all of the day care staff, traumatized the children byflushing their Rugrats dolls down the toilet, then found his way into thekitchens and larders of the facility, looking for a nice mincemeat pie or somecarrot-whisky crème brulee to satisfy his terrible hunger for solid food.But the refrigerator only contained mashed bananas and stewed peas, and bottleafter bottle of Zantac and Metamucil. "Holy Fatty Bolger Stuck in a Tub of Apple Butter!" Morrie thought to himself."They're planning to give HeyHoDen heartburn and incontinence all at once! Imust warn the King immediately!"But as the hobbit slipped from the refrigerator to the floor and ambled pastthe trashcan, he paused and sniffed. Then sniffed again, with all the olfactorysense of a desperately hungry hobbit."Bless my stars and garters," he announced, "there's a half-eaten éclairsomewhere in that trash bag!"Remembering what had happened to George in an early episode of Seinfeld, butlooking around and seeing no one, he scrambled up and over the side of the bag,and disappeared like a grub worm into its depths, eating his way to the bottomand thus to the elusive pastry.While the barrel rocked and swayed, the door opened and Otto the groundskeepershuffled into the room. He was already tired from cleaning up after the DwarfAcrobatic Team, which had sprayed beer around most of the hallways as some sortof hazing ritual, and most of the mops in his janitorial closet had beenmysterious broken as if in the throes of passion. Now there was trash to dumpbefore his day's work was complete and he could retire to the golf course inorder to gopher some grub. His hunchback straining, Otto did not even notice the small thrashing shape atthe bottom of the Hefty garbage bag (which was made for trolls -- so tough itcould hold ten hobbits and more besides!) nor the impending plot twist'ssimilarity to the scene with Veruca Salt in "Willy Wonka and the ChocolateFactory.""Ooof!" said Otto, dumping the bag down the chute."Aiiiiiii!" said the bag as it disappeared down the hatch."Whoomph!" said the incinerator as the bag hit the furnace, spelling an end tomost of Morrie's pointless angst, depression, and lack of identity in theentire series, and ensuring that, out of the nine walkers of the fellowship, atleast one of them would taste the equivalent of the flames of the Crack of Doomsince even Boromir had already come back from the dead -- albeit with a bit ofcosmetic surgery.Scratching his head, Otto found Morrie's discarded "I'm One Bad Hobbit" buttonand, liking the sparkly colors, pinned it on his cardigan and wandered outside-- where he was rudely intercepted by a gray-cloaked rider mounted on achugging Harley, who smiled grimly in recognition at the sight of his button. "Come, Morrie!" cried the rider, who definitely resembled the pretty blondechick who was always in his way every time Otto went into the janitorialclosets looking for toilet cleaner but now insisted that her name was Dirtheadrather than Eowynifred."Aragon is alive!" s/he continued, gray eyes flashing. "He who has scorned me,and yet still lives! Well, that misfortune must be remedied! Come to MinasTirith with me, Morrie, and we shall have our revenge! Wa ha ha! Wa ha ha! Waha ha!"Otto stared at her in confusion, but once the writer whispered in his ear andtold him that someone had to carry on for poor departed Morrie, the confusioncleared. (AUTHOR NOTE: Due to budget constraints, the part of Morrie Brandybuck will nowbe played by a big, dopey, grotesque, mostly bald hunchback.)"Okeedokily!" said Otto, leaping upon the back of the Harley with a screech ofstrained metal."Oh, Morrie, you've been picking again, haven't you?" noted Dirthead. "Stickthose 'ten days to thin thighs' and you'll feel much better. You know trollsonly eat chubby hobbits, they throw the rest back.""Burp," agreed Otto.***And so it came to pass that when the King himself had set out, behind themysterious Dirthead hunched Otto the mutant groundskeeper, sitting in for poordeparted Morrie who had never stood a chance anyway, and the great bike namedWinnebago spluttered under the great burden but did not stop, for it knew thatits engine would be throttled if it did not get Dirthead to Gondor in order toslay the breaker of her heart, the Lord Aragon, if indeed he still lived atall.And all of the story became chaotic and bewildering; and ever the confusiondeepened before them; and irony continued to dog their paths. Selah.

But first, we turnto our weather correspondent, Súriel Gwildol![Weather correspondent appears.  She looks much like Anchor 1, exceptwith poofier hair.]Weather C.: Thanks, Sar!  Well, have we got weather tonight!  Muggy andsticky tonight, with no chance of rain, but we've got another warmfront moving in from the east, carrying a huge bank of clouds fromMount Viagra.  Wonder what's cooking out there, huh?  Moms, better takeyour washing in early 'cause we might get a little ash falling out fromthose clouds, though it looks as if all that air is going to be liftedup over the cooler air this side of Anduin.  The current temperature isjust above freezing, with highs later on today in the fifties.Anchor 1: Thanks for the report, Súriel!  Well, we're all wonderingwhat's cooking in the Black Land, aren't we, Sargon?!Anchor 2: Indeed we are, Melineth.Anchor 1: And our first report! looks at preparations for war withinthe City!  Let's go to our star roving reporter, Ariellë Húriniel![Shot of reporter standing in the street shouting into microphone whilegesticulating.]Reporter: Well, all around me the preparations are going on to bringMinas Tirith into a war footing!  But we're by no means unprepared. Ever since trade negotiations with Mordor looked like they were goingto break down over the copyright issue, Lord Denethor has been buyingup stock, hiring corporate lawyers, and dominating the news, scoringcoup after propaganda coup!  We're definitely well positioned to ridethat one out.Anchor 2: Well, that's good to know, Ariellë.  Can you tell us exactlywhere you are right now?Reporter:  I'm right in the absolute thick of things, Sargon; in theheart of the Citadel itself, at the barracks of the Citadel Guard,where, as you can imagine, excitement is rising to a fever pitch![Camera pulls back to reveal an empty, silent street.]Anchor 1:  Ariellë, tell us about that uniform you're wearing!Reporter: Well, as you know, I'm a long-time member of the GuardReserve, and I've just been activated due to the emergency, though Iexpect to continue serving PalanTirith as a reporter.  This is based onthe ancient Atlantean naval uniform, and it's full of symbolism!Anchor 2: I can see that.Reporter: Right now we're going to go into the Guard barracks, and seewhat the boys are up to.  Let's go![Tracking shot follows Ariellë into barracks.  Lights shine on a veryfat old man leaning over one of the beds.]Reporter: Well, as you can see, we have, uh, what we have here is, uh,a man who seems to be engaged in the act of, uh, placing a pillow overthe face of one of the Guards.  Let's see if we can find out more.[The man turns and blinks into the camera]Reporter:  Why, it's Mesprendeur, formerly Court Fool of Gondor! Would you like to tell us what's going on here?*     *     *   Gandalf turned around, sensing difficulties with his plot.  He foundhimself staring down, down, down at a very young woman in the garb of asoldier of the Citadel, holding a microphone into his face.  "Um," hereplied, "I was just engaging in some friendly fraternity hazing..."   The young woman had, however slipped past him with her camera crew,and they were focused on Pipsqueak, still gasping for air.   "Why, aren't you the famous Prince Paragraph of Took, Lord of theHalfwitts?"   "Hobbits," gasped Pipsqueak.  His gasps had less to do with want ofoxygen, or even outrage at the use of traditional Gondorian epithets,than with the woman standing before him.  She was only a few inchestaller than Pipsqueak himself, with long red hair fastened up on eachside by seashell-shaped pins.  She could hardly be older than sixteen,Pipsqueak thought, and wasn't especially well-developed for her age;but she was wearing that remarkable uniform to great effect.   "Hobbits," repeated the woman to the cameras, "is a term in theHalfwitts' quaint northern dialect.  So tell me, Prince Paragraph, howdo you find Gondor?"   "Well, you take the rooad through Edoras, and toorn right at MountMinnie," Pipsqueak said brightly, falling easily into his new rôle andmaking sure to have as rustic an accent as possible.   "So why do you call yourselves hobbits?"   "Oh," said Paragraph, "it's joost a name.  We could 'ave calledourselves 'boggies', bot we liked the sound of 'obbits bettah."   The other guards, who had woken at the sound of the interview,crushed themselves around Pipsqueak and Gandalf, rendering escape forthe latter impossible.   When the messengers from Denethor came laterto summon them, the interview was still going on.   Before long Pipsqueak was walking with Gandalf (under heavy guard)once more down the marble passage to the Tower Hall.  There Denethorsat in the gloom, eyes darting to left and right, like a skitterycockroach ready to bolt into the nearest crack in the wainscoting,Pipsqueak thought; thus intuiting, though he did not know it,Denethor's most common nickname among the folk of Gondor.   Denethor sat staring at the tickertape emerging from a machine onhis desk.  "Belfast Resorts down, MTStarChannel down, Lebanon ThemePark down, PalanTirith way way down..." he mumbled sorrowfully tohimself.  He looked more hopeful when he saw Pipsqueak approaching, andmanaged a sort of smile.   "Well, Master Paragraph, I hope you have enjoyed the City?  Thoughyou may have found fewer drugs available than you hoped for."   Pipsqueak had the uncomfortable feeling that there were a great manysurveillance cameras planted where he could not see them, and mentallythwapped himself for not having thought of that before.   "So, what would you do in my service?  Can you sing?  Tap dance? Jump through hoops?"   "I can sing... a little," Pipsqueak answered half-truthfully.  "Wellenough for my own people.  But we have no songs fit for mighty castlesand theme parks, lord.  We seldom sing of anything more joyous than theassassination of an enemy.  And most of my songs are sad and dolorous,not to mention downright depressing."   "And why should such songs be unfit for my castle?  We who have longoffered entertainment and amusement may surely listen to echoes from aprimitive and barbarous country without such benefits?  Then we may becertain that there remain markets to be exploited."   Pipsqueak's heart sank.  Most of the songs he knew were bawdyballads entirely out of place in the family-oriented atmosphere ofMinas Tirith; but at length he dredged up from his memory a semi-cleanpiece that was pseudo-traditional in his family, to be sung with aBucklebeltland Brogue:   From the day that we're born till the day that we die,   There's never a pleasure that money can't buy,   So pour out the whiskey and drink it with glee,   For Death and the Devil are our company!   In the game-hall we gamble till money be gone,   Then the shirts off our backs go to him who has won,   But never mind money, we'll get more for free,   When Death and the Devil are our company!   In the bawdy-house we'll find Jill, Janet and Rox,   We'll enjoy them each one till they give us the pox,   Which the apothecary cures for a small fee,   Since Death and the Devil are our company!   In a dirty back alley well covered in mud,   A jolly sharp bodkin shall pour out our blood,   The four of us ever together shall be,   We, Death and the Devil in one company!   By the end of this song, Denethor was laughing and pounding hisfist on the table in time to the music.  "Well done!" he cried. "Flunkey!  We've got a new musical here!"   Gandalf interrupted.  "Denethor!" he said.  "We should be talkingabout the Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Eonard,HeyHoDen's nephew..."   "Nutz to that," Denethor replied.  "I already know all about it. Say, Paragraph, you'd better get into the livery of the Tower, I likeall of my manservants to wear it.  Return when you are suitably clad!"   Pippin wandered somberly from the Tower, hoping against hope that hewould be spared the ordeal.  The weather, as predicted, was quitegloomy, and it was only by sheer accident that, after many hours of "accidentally" wandering around the city (and noting the few gin-jointsand speakeasies still open for business) that he ran into Bererondagain.  Bererond had to chase him for many blocks before catching him;but at last, yielding to the older man's sense of propriety, he foundhimself ensconced with Bererond in a high embattlement of the city,looking out at the scene below and licking his chocolate éclair.      It was the sunset hour, and maybe across the river in EthelienFrodo and Sam were romping in Disgiliath, but here in the shadow ofMinas Minnie nothing so orgiastic could possibly occur. Pipsqueaksighed.  Already it seemed years to him since he had come to MinasTirith, when he had still been a footloose and spendthrift wastrel. Now he was an employee of the Tower of Commerce, earning a salary.  Insome other time and place Pipsqueak might have been pleased with hisbenefit package, but he knew now that with Minas Tirith's stocksinking like a rock, his options were fast becoming worthless.  Hefretted.   "You are concerned about your stock options?" Bererond said cannily.   "Yes," admitted Pipsqueak, "very; but I'm more worried about thedepressing effect this trade war will have on the entire economy.  Notto mention the depressing effect the weather is having on me.  Do youoften have such glooms when the wind is in the East?"   "Nay," said Beregond, "this is no weather of the world.  This issome pollution brewed by the Dark Lord in his great factories inNurnenshire.  Doubtless he is producing some new product that can beproduced more cheaply and in more massive quantities than our owntourist fare."   "Yes," said Pipsqueak.  "I think Gandalf is also worried about thecompetition.  And I think he was disappointed not to find Faramir here. And where has he got to?  He seemed to have lost some argument withDenethor, and was in a bad mood, more so than usual.  Perhaps he hassome foreboding of Bad News."*     *     *Anchor 1: Good evening!

They turn wildly,regain control, and fly off East in a precision formation]Reporter: Stinger anti-aircraft missiles!Anchor 1: What a deal, huh!Reporter [grinning]: And the best part is, we bought them from Mordororiginally!Anchor 2: So what's going on down there?  It looks as if theLamborghini were headed straight for the lead car and....[Distant sounds of crunching metal][A moment of silence]Reporter: We appear to have, er, some kind of a sort of a situationhere.... [sotto voce] damn, that was a nice car.*     *     *   It was not long before a noisy hubbub was heard in the streetsleading up from the outer circles, and there was much cursing andcrying of the names of Faramir and Mesprendeur.  Presently Pipsqueaksaw headlights, and followed by a huge crowd, Mesprendeur riding slowlyon a huge Haug of Mordor (or Harlë in the Elfish tongue).  On hishandlebars, spread in a good imitation of a Pietá, was the limp body ofDoctor Faramir.   Pipsqueak pressed forward as they passed through the gates, and whenhe saw Faramir's death-like face he caught his breath.  It was not thepallor that dismayed him -- he had seen corpses aplenty before -- butthe unholy likeness between Faramir's visage and that of Gandalf ridingbehind.   The Haug screeched to a halt, still belching smoke.  "Friends,"Gandalf said sadly, "I come to you bringing ill news.  Here is DoctorFaramir, who has been, I fear, mortally wounded in the motor accidentthat tragically occurred just as I was saving him from the grip of theevil Black Helicopters."   A sigh arose from the crowd, as well as a high-pitched "No!" fromPipsqueak.  At its sound, Faramir suddenly opened his eyes.   "I'm not dead yet!" he gasped, glazed eyes staring at the heavens. "I have seen... halfwitts!  Like him!" he continued, pointing inPipsqueak's direction, "But in Ethelien, bearing the R..."   At Faramir's first words, Gandalf bent over him with a concernedlook.  One hand of Gandalf's was upon Faramir's breast and anotherbehind his neck as Faramir's last word collapsed into a dying croak. "Alas, alas!" cried Gandalf.  "Faramir has passed away even as he gaveus his last words: 'Victory, victory to Gondor forever!'  Farewell,Prince of Gondor!  Take him away to the Tombs.  Bitter will be thisdeath for Denethor, Steward and CEO."  He bowed his head in grief.   So at length Gandalf and Pipsqueak came to the private chamber ofDenethor.  There were recliners and good central heating, and coldbeers were brought; and Pipsqueak hid behind Denethor's chair, havingno will to get involved in the inevitable argument.   "So, Denethor," Gandalf began, "Now all have seen me risk my lifeto save your son.  Let my good will to Gondor be doubted no more! Alas that I could not give my life to save his!"   Denethor snorted.  "You killed him," he replied.   "Piffle," quoth Gandalf.  "He sustained severe injuries in the caraccident..."   "Which you caused," interposed Denethor.   "Which accidentally happened in the course of my rescue mission. Would you rather he was killed by Nazdaq bullets?"   Denethor shrugged.  "You tell me.  He was your son, after all."   Gandalf arose, red-faced.  "I deny that!"   "Whatever.  In any case, your point is that you have now convincedcertain gullible persons in the City that you are a hero, and youintend to use your new-found status to claim influence.  Very well. What do you want?"   Gandalf drew himself up, and began to speak as if declaiming aspeech long rehearsed.  "The Elder Age is gone, Denethor, Lord of Men. The Middle Ages are passing. Now comes the New Age, and a vast fortuneis to be made selling crystals, beads, books, and tapes of soothingmusic to an immense new market.  This is the world which we must rule!"   "Bullcrap, Gandalf!  That'll always be a niche market and you knowit.  Whereas in every age people want to see movies about bouncyanimals with big eyes, so I'm not worried about these Ages anyway.  Butwhat do you mean 'we'?  You and your tapeworm?"   Gandalf strode up and down the room, making Kow-milking motions withhis hands.  "I am offering you a state beyond your comprehension!  Doyou not see how events have providentially transpired?  Your heirs arelost to you.  But, as if from heaven, there comes from the north ascion of ..."   "I have an heir, Mesprendeur," Denethor calmly interrupted.   "What?" Gandalf sneered.  "Your elder son, Boromir, is mostcertainly dead -- I have reliable reports that he died in a hail ofOrk-bullets across the Anduin..."   "Yes, yes, I know all that."   "You do?"   Denethor winked.  "Never mind."   "And your son Faramir has just died."   "I still have an heir.  And I wasn't planning on dying or goingbonkers just yet, so holdjer horses and wait in line and tell Aragonson of Arabarf,  or whatever his name is, to park his résumé withCentral Casting."   Gandalf stood up, tall and terrible, and fixed Denethor with adeadly piercing gaze.  "My Lord Denethor," he said, "the cares andtroubles of office, the tragical deaths of your two sons, and a rapidlyencroaching senility have weakened your reason.  Your wife Clarabellais long dead, you are old and impotent, and since her death you havepreferred the company of strapping young men in very short sailortunics.  You cannot possibly have an heir."   Denethor burst out laughing.  "Did you come all this way just totry to reclaim your job as Court Fool?  You're just proving that youreally were 'out of the loop'.  I remarried years back, in a smallprivate ceremony to which you were not invited.  And you vastlyunderestimate the power of the loins of the House of Húrin.  As for theGuard uniform - heh - I just think it's cute."   "Then who is this heir?" Gandalf shouted furiously.   "Ah," replied Denethor with a grin, laying a finger aside of hisnose, "perhaps my heir would be safer if left unknown to MonsieurMesprendeur.  I leave it to you to find out.  But I'll give you somehints: despite a certain youthful appearance, my heir has alreadysolo-climbed Mount Minnie, gone spelunking in the Caves of Aglarond,deep-sea-dived in the Bay of Tampalas, defeated the Corsairs in theirown stadium twice, is an astronaut (elenciryamo) in Project Elemmrë,a Brigadier of the Citadel Guard..."*     *     *Anchor 1: So, Ariellë -- I realize this is an especially difficult timefor you -- but can you try to put in words how you feel about the lossof your brother?Reporter [tissue in one hand]: Shocked, Melineth.  Saddened. Grief-stricken.  Upset.  The fall of Doctor Faramir isn't just apersonal loss, it's a loss for all the people of Gondor.  But we allneed to be strong and keep his memory alive by fight, fight, fightingfor the noble Atlantean ideals that he stood for!Anchor 2: We feel your pain and appreciate your patriotic sentiments. Ladies and gentlement, a moment of silence for Faramir Húrinion, MD,PhD, 2983-3019.*     *     *"... and star reporter for PalanTirith, our corporate-run, nationallytelevised newsmagazine.  You really ought to watch that show."   Gandalf wheeled about.  "Great grief will come of this!" he shoutedgrandiloquently.  "You haven't seen the last of me yet!  Come on,Paragraph."  He strode forth boldly from the room, tripped on the edgeof the carpet, and fell on his face.*     *     *Anchor 1:  Good morning!  And welcome! to the morning edition ofPalanTirith! featuring round-the-clock news from Minas Tirith!  I'myour morning anchor, Gwilwileth Lindoriel! and this is my co-host,Gonhir Malbornion!Anchor 2: Thank you Gwil, and good morning.  Today is the eleventh ofSúlime thirty-nineteen.  We'll have late-breaking war news coming up injust a moment.  But first, we turn to our weather correspondent, SúrielGwildol!Weather C.: Thanks, Gon!  Well, it's just going to be totally blahtoday.  There's a thick cloud cover coming out of Mount Viagra, andthat's going to keep the temperatures down in the forties.  No sun, norain expected today or tomorrow; more of the same tonight, with tempsdropping below freezing.Anchor 2: Thanks for the report, Súriel.  And in today's war news, ourSpecial Correspondent Brigadier Ariellë Húriniel has been put incommand of the forces of Gondor in Disgiliath.Anchor 1: That's right, Gon!  While there were disputes over herappointment at the Steward's Council, in the end the voices in favor ofAriellë's overwhelming competence won the day!*     *     *   Early in the morning the Council had been summoned.  There wereDenethor, Lord of the City; Forlong the Fat, Lord of Lotstarch,Captain of Gondor; Ariellë, Steward's heir; Paragraph Took, CourtSongster; and Gandalf the White, recently reinstated, following aseries of truly amazing pratfalls, as Court Fool.  Forlong had had aspecially-built, triple-sized chair brought in for him, and as theinitial formalities were being completed had been snarfing down a loadof unpeeled potatoes provided him in a bushel basket.  "Hieland spuds,specialty o' Lotstarch," he grunted confidentially to Pipsqueak with agrin.  "Guid for wha' ails ye!"   "Friends," Denethor began, "today the fate of Gondor is onthe line.  Our stocks are slipping and our expenses are mounting.  If wecan't fight off Sauron and his corporate lawyers, our trademarks may beinvalidated and poof, there goes our franchise.  We're looking atbankruptcy, lady and gentlemen.  Bankruptcy."   Silence filled the Council hall save for a gasp from Pipsqueak.   Forlong interrupted.  "If I may put in a wee word, my LairdSteuart," he began.  Ariellë sighed and took out a book.     "My Lord Forlong," nodded Denethor.   "Weel, ye see it's this way.  Back in Lotstarch we hae a wee sayin',that findin's keepin', and keepin's haein'.  Noo I am registered andtrademarked, as the custom is, as 'Forlong the Fat', and I canna behaein' imposters imposin' upon my wee scrap o' territory.  So wha' I'maskin' is, why yon porridge-stuffed beggar" -- he pointed at Gandalf --"is gi'en yer Lairdship's countenance at this meeting."   "My Lord Mesprendeur is a very funny fellow," Denethor began toreply.   "Aye, aye, tha's a' very weel, but as we say in Lotstarch, twabellies in ae ruim must come tae blaws.  There's anely ruim enow inGondor for ane fat man, and that man's Forlong.  I insist that this'Gandalf' the Wizard, Clown or whate'er he be, cease and desist frombein' fat for as lang as he dwells in this kingdom.  Those are myrichts, my Laird, and I demand 'em!"   "My Lord Forlong," Denethor answered dubiously, "we are not here todiscuss your trademarks... and I don't see how Gandalf can stop beingfat."   "We'll soon see aboot that," Forlong replied. "I challenge thissae-called Gandalf tae a duel -- here and noo, my laird, here and noo!"   "Not in the Council Hall -- please, my Lord..."   "Och Aye, m'laird!  'Tis written in Ye Olde Medieval Charter thatyer wise ancestors granted to Minas Mickey, that a dispute betweenmembers o' the Council sall be decided anely in the Council Hall!  Myrichts, Laird Steuart! I demand my richts!"   Denethor sighed.  Pipsqueak thought he saw Ariellë mouth wordsacross the table, something like "f....n rules lawyer".     "Denethor!" Gandalf fumed.  "Are you really going to permit thisoutrage?"   Denethor shrugged.  "Court Fools are expendable.  You'd betterprepare yourself.  Lord Forlong, what is the form of the duel?"   "As it e'er has been and sall be... wrastling tae a fall, o' course!"   Forlong rose from the table and began to strip off his clothing. Underneath his tunic, he turned out to be wearing a white loinclothsuspended from a broad black belt.  Stomping to the far end of theCouncil Hall, he began spreading a large circle on the floor, composedentirely of potatoes.  Taking his stance at one side of the circle, hestamped loudly with both feet.     Gandalf, most unwillingly, was pressed into the circle by theothers.  He was not obliged to remove his robes.  Forlong began tocircle around him as Gandalf began to intone "I am Gandalf the White,the Great Wizard.  Hear my words and obey them.  Your limbs are w....OOF!"   Forlong's massive limbs slammed into Gandalf's belly, and reached asfar as they could around his ample girth.  "Huh!" Forlong grunted, asstraining he heaved Gandalf from the ground.   Gandalf arose easily into the air.  "Hah!" Forlong shouted in a toneof surprise.  "Licht as ae feether ye are!  Noo feel the micht o'Forlong the Fat!"  And with a mighty heave he flung Gandalf to thestone floor.   And Gandalf bounced.  Five feet in the air he rose from the pointwhere he had struck the ground, and then he fell, and bounced again. "Wha' sorcery?" exclaimed Forlong, baffled for an instant.  Then agleam came into his eyes.  "My laird Steuart!  I claim foul play andcheatin'!  Yon Mesprendeur's nae fat at a'!"   "What do you mean?" Denethor asked.  Gandalf was sitting, somewhatdazed, chin sunk into his puffy chest.   "I'll shaw ye," Forlong replied, and darted from the ring to thetable, where he picked up and returned a sharp potato knife.   "No bloodshed!  No bloodshed!" cried Denethor in horror.   "Nay, my laird, there'll be nane.  Just a wee cut..."  and with thatForlong stabbed hard into Gandalf's chest.   There was a tearing sound and then an immense explosion.  Forlongwas blown across to one of the side walls.  When the others looked backat Gandalf, blown to the opposite wall, they saw that his chest hadwholly caved in.  "Balloons!" chortled Forlong in glee.  "Th'impostor's been usin' rubber balloons!"   The stunned Gandalf was returned to the table, where a searchrevealed several more balloons.  These removed, he appeared much lessimposing, and spent a long time chewing at his beard and muttering tohimself.   "Now that this trademark dispute has been satisfactorily resolved,"Denethor said, "we can return to our business.  Now I understand,Forlong, that you alone responded to the summons sent to the provinces. Where are the rest of our Field Staff?  Where are Degrevant of RingletVale, Dodinas, Dinadan and Dagonet of the Vale of Martha*, Galahaut of Gwyntystorm, Duke Angér of Lameduc, Hervis of the Green Hills ofVermont, the deep-sea divers of the Ether, and not least of all, whereis Prince Amraphel of Dinas Emrys?"[* Named for an ancient Steward of Gondor.]   "Och," Forlong replied, "Weel, Degrevant was hae'in motor trouble,Dodinas, Dinadan and Dagonet were on vacation, Galahaut had tae attendhis grandniece's wedding, Angér was plannin' a fishin' party, Hervisdidn't feel like it, the deep-sea divers were deep-sea divin', andAmraphel was oot tae lunch, or sae I hae been tald."   "So we have nothing to stand against Sauron's subpoenas, or whateverelse he chooses to throw at us."   "Aye, but we can tak 'em weel, my Laird!  Those Sauron boys arenobbut a rabble o' pantywaists, if ye ask me."   "If the subpoenas are to be served, they'll be served atDisgiliath," Gandalf put in suddenly.  "'Twere best to ambush thelawyers there."   "So who will lead the ambush?" Denethor asked, and silence reignedonce more.   "Mesprendeur has a sartin heroic presence, or sae they tell me,"Forlong said at length, not without sarcasm.   "Yes," answered Gandalf snidely, "but due to a certain person'sinterference, I no longer possess the powers of divine rotundity givenme by the Valar to aid Gondor!  I have heard, however, that the Lordof the City has in his service a person of great strength and skills:astronaut, navigator, skydiver, general..."   "Who, me?" said Ariellë looking up from her book.  "Sure, I'll go."*     *     *Anchor 2:   Good evening, and welcome to our evening edition ofPalanTirith.  I'm Sargon Turgonion; my co-host, Melineth Malthuriel isoff today.  In today's war news, a Flag and Drum Corps has issued fromMinas Goofy and is marching on Disgiliath.  They have been joined byrockabilly bands from the South.  We have also learned that theNameless Tenor, known to many as the Leech-King, is leading them, andthe fear of his singing has passed before him across the River.*     *     *Anchor 1:   Good morning, this twelfth day of Súlimë.  I'm GwilwilethLindoriel, and welcome to our abbreviated morning edition ofPalanTirith.  In today's war news, our boys have suffered a temporaryreverse at Disgiliath, apparently being met not, as they expected, by asubpoena but by large numbers of automatic weapons and some appallingbrass.  Brigadier Ariellë is leading the troops in a strategic movementto the rear, returning to the forts on the wall of the Lammas Ichor. The Court Fool, Lord Mesprendeur, was also dispatched to the front withorders to pick up the mens' spirits.*     *     *Anchor 2:   Good morning on another gloomy day, the thirteenth ofSúlimë.  We have another dispatch from the front.  The enemy hasdynamited, I repeat, dynamited the Lammas Ichor, which now stands inruins and poses no hindrance whatsoever to the advance of the enemy. This a gross contravention of the rules of war which, as finalized inthe Disgiliath Accords, require them to stand on one side of the wallwhile we hurl insults and cows at them.  This is a terrible atrocity.Anchor 1: That's right, Gonhir.  Court Fool Lord Mesprendeur was thefirst to return from the scene of the crime, and has gone straight tothe CEO's office.  And on our northeast flank, the vacation island ofCaer Andrews has also been seized by the enemy, who are now said to beerecting a bandshell there.*     *     *Anchor 1: This is Melineth Malthuriel, reporting to you from the wallof the First Circle.  This is a special edition of PalanTirith,reporting on what is already becoming known as The Siege.Anchor 2 [from studio]: Can you describe what you see behind you, Mel?Anchor 1: Sure can, Sar.  Those men down there are our troops, tryingto get to the wall before the enemy gets here.  The enemy is probablyabout seven miles distant now, and they are within, I repeat, withinthe Lammas Ichor.  We can't see the enemy from here, but in thedistance you can see searchlights.  According to the stories fromretreating survivors, anyone caught in the lights is brutallymachine-gunned.Anchor 2: Have we got any artillery or anything else that we can useagainst them?Anchor 1: Well, Sar, I'm afraid that Minas Tirith was built primarilyas an amusement center and most of the weapons we have are non-workingreplicas.   We were really expecting a legal, not a military attack atthis point, and the story is that we were basically caught with ourpants down.  But I'm told that even as we speak, engineers are combingthe caves under Mount Minnie looking for anything that can help us. Anchor 2 [quiet for a moment]: I see.  Is there any news of Ariellë?Anchor 1: She's supposed to be guiding the retreat.   That may be hercompany back there in the middle of your screen, marching steadilytoward the gate.  They're about a quarter of a mile away right now. And here come some jeeps...[distant sounds of shouting; the whole area is illuminated bysearchlights]Anchor 1: They're under attack, even as we speak!  A company of whatlooks like Orks, and, uh, motorized troops with red flags areattacking.  Our boys are turning to face them and...WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUPAnchor 2: Melineth!?  Are you all right?Anchor 1: It's complete chaos out there!  It looks like we have aNazdaq attack along with everything else![Siren sounds]Anchor 1: There's a siren from our walls -- something's happening downthere -- it's motorcycles!  A whole squadron of harli from our side! And there's Forlong the Fat leading them![Very Loud Sound of Explosion]Anchor 1: I think a missile's just gone off near one of the Nazdaqs. That must be one of the Stingers.   The Nazdaq and the other troops areretreating.  We seem to be picking up what survives of Ariellë'scompany and returning to the gate.  We're going to go down off the walland see if we can get some pictures from Gate Square.Anchor 2 [in grim tones]: So just to recap what we've seen in the lastfew minutes.  Our troops, retreating from the walls which the enemydynamited earlier today.  One of our companies attacked by enemy troopsand Nazdaqs.  Ariellë Húriniel: her fate unknown.Anchor 1: Okay, Sar, we're back.  Can we get a picture here?  This isForlong the Fat, Lord of Lotstarch, carrying what looks to be the bodyof Ariellë in his arms?Anchor 2: How is she?Anchor 1: I can definitely see some blood.  No sign of movement. They're putting her into a City Ambulance, so I assume she's not dead. Let's talk to one of the men who was with her.  Private, can you tellus what happened?Soldier: Yeah, uh, we was marchin' back after the snafu at Disg, an wesuddenly got spotted an' fired on by a Suthren jeep column.  LadyAriellë took a bullet just before the cycles came in.Anchor 2: And so we end our Special Edition of PalanTirith.  Our boys,safely back in the city.  Brigadier Ariellë, wounded and taken tohospital.  Lord Forlong has gone to discuss matters with the CEO. Until next time, I'm Sargon Turgonion.*     *     *Anchor 1:  Good morning!  And welcome! to the morning edition ofPalanTirith! featuring round-the-clock news from Minas Tirith!  I'myour morning anchor, Gwilwileth Lindoriel! and this is my co-host,Gonhir Malbornion!Anchor 2: Thank you Gwil, and good morning.  Today is the fourteenth ofSúlime thirty-nineteen, and Day One of the Siege of Gondor.  If youtake a look out at the Pelennor this morning, you'll see some drasticchanges in the scenery.Anchor 1: That's right, Gon.  The Pelennor is entirely occupied byenemy troops, who have set up camps and have been digging trenches and,we hope, latrines.  We also see what appear to be emplacements formortars and howitzers.  Behind them are what appear to be largecompanies of tanks that crossed the river last night.  We still lookfor reinforcements out of Edoras, but whether any help will come fromthe Riddlemark remains a riddle.Anchor 2: Speaking of riddles, some of you may have been wondering whatthat awful noise is that started about midnight last night.Anchor 1: And the answer is, that it's a brass orchestra out therepracticing.  If we zoom in to our left, we'll see a large banner spreadout over those three-story-tall amplifiers projecting the music thisway; you'll also be able to see the Flag and Drum Corps practicingtheir moves.Anchor 2: Looks pretty good, Gwil!  So tell me, what does the bannersay?Anchor 1: It's written in an Orkish variety of runic, but our expertsagree that it says something like "Ragmug's All-Brass Military MarchingBand."Anchor 2: Let's see if we can get some audio pickup from out there. How are we doing?  All right, this is what it sounds like:[Clashing brass and throaty voices singing off key 'La Cucaracha, laCucaracha, ya no puede caminar; porque no tiene, porque le falta,miruvóre que tomar...']Anchor 2: I think we don't need much more of that...[Sound of huge explosion]Anchor 1: What was that?[Shadow passes in front of cameras]Anchor 2: I've just been handed a notice saying that the enemy arelaunching incendiary missiles into the city.  They are landing all overthe city.  Anything outside that is flammable may burn.  Please stayindoors and do not go outside.  Make sure that all flammable goods aretaken inside.  We will update you as necessary.[WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP]Anchor 1 (plaintively): Oh, sh*t, I hate those choppers.*     *     *   During all this black day Ariellë lay upon her bed in a bunkerbeneath the Tower of Commerce, in a fever that no amount of quininewould assuage.  'Dying', someone said; and soon 'dying' was repeated upand down the streets of the city.  By her Denethor sat, and watched,and let the strings of government slip into the hands of pettyfunctionaries.   One of these was Pipsqueak Took, who now waited upon Denethor, notsinging songs now, but tasked with telling anyone who came there fororders to go away. For long hours he sat by the Steward, hearingnothing but the shouting of the Civil Defence Brigades, the snarlingsounds of distant brass instruments, and the whup whup whup of theNazdaq.  He saw Denethor crying silently.   "Don't cry," he said.  "She could get better.  Did you ask Gandalf?"   Denethor spat.  "Why should I ask the fool?  His hope has failed. The Enemy owns our trademarks now.  This is even as Gandalf wished it:the utter end of the House of Húrin.  Mean folk shall run what remainsof our franchise, selling tee-shirts and coffee-mugs at roadsideconcessions, making what profits they can on the black market untilMordor finally deprives them of their licenses."   Men came to the door crying for the CEO.  "Nay, I will not comedown," he said.  "I must stay beside my daughter.  Follow whom youwill, even the Court Fool, though his hope has failed.  Here I stay."*     *     *Anchor 1: Good evening, I'm Melineth Malthuriel, continuing our SiegeBroadcast from PalanTirith's new studio in a bunker under the SeventhCircle.  Sargon Turgonion will not be with us, as he was killed earliertoday in a Nazdaq incendiary bombing raid.  In other news, Denethor,Steward and CEO of Gondor, has effectively abdicated, turning powerover to Court Fool -- now Generalissimo -- Mesprendeur who will becharge of Defence Ops.  He's been making the rounds of the walls,trying to put some spirit back into the men with light humor andjuggling tricks, but unfortunately everybody gets depressed again oncehe leaves.  And why shouldn't they be?  We're all going to die realsoon.  [sigh]  Well, let's go to Gonhir Malbornion who is now reportingfrom the First Circle and can tell us just how hopeless the situationis.Reporter: It does look pretty hopeless, Mel.  If you take a lookaround, you'll see that the entire First Circle is on fire due to theincendiaries.  The enemy has been using explosive artillery against theouter wall, but they haven't been able to do much.  But smaller bombshave been launched against the upper circles, and they've been doing alot of damage, in some cases levelling entire sections of wall.  You'relucky to  be up there in those bunkers.Anchor 1: I don't feel lucky, Gon.Reporter: If you look behind me, you'll be able to see the tanksmassing in the area just in front of the Great Gate.  It looks as ifthat's where the main assault will come.Anchor 1: And then it will be over, Gon?Reporter: Maybe, but I suppose we'll all be dead by then.*     *     *   Messengers came again to the Tower chamber, and this time Pipsqueaklet them enter.  "Bombs are falling all over the City, Lord," theysaid.  "What do you want us to do?  Nobody wants to follow Mesprendeur,much less stay on the walls and offer a target visible from seven milesaway."   "Fly," muttered Denethor, looking at one that buzzed around thechamber with a hungry look.  "Why don't the fools fly?  They could ifthey had wings.  But we all have wings, even the Balrogs.  We could flyaway from here, somewhere over the rainbow, way up high..."   "There are reports, Sir, that the enemy is contemplating a gasattack.  Should we start distributing gas masks and pills?  There areonly enough for a few of us."   "Gas," said Denethor.  "Better to be gassed sooner than later, forlife's a gas.  And I?  I will go to my gas chamber!  For it's all rightnow.  In fact it's a gas!  I'm Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas,gas!"   The messengers turned and fled.   Denethor looked at Pipsqueak and winked.  "That always works," hewhispered.  "Well, we'd better evacuate.  Probably the safest place isthe Tombs, on the other side of the Hill, under Mount Minnie.  Callsome servants and we'll take Ariellë there.  And, if we're lucky, we'llsoon see the Angels of Avalon."   Pipsqueak called the servants, and taking up Ariellë's bed theyclimbed out of the bunker into the Seventh Circle.  The clouds abovethem were lit with red flashes from explosions and the white ofsearchlights.  The sound of the Nazdaq choppers rang clear through thestill air.  Its own floodlights out, the Castle of Lornavaniwen loomeddark against the clouds behind them.  Denethor stopped by Tarzan'sTreehouse and sighed.   They passed on into the Sixth Circle, and soback west to the rear of the City.  There, where the walls were stainedwith graffiti, stood an almost unregarded, inconsequential lookingdoor, painted a peeling pale green, with a keyhole in the center of itsmetal knob.  Postno Bills it was called, on account of the stenciledletters faintly spraypainted on it.  Beyond it went a winding road thatdescended into the narrow land between Minas Tirith and Mount Minnie,where half the City threw its garbage.   It was also the place of the Tombs of the Stewards.  Denethorfished the key out from his rather impressive keyring and unlocked thedoor, and they wound on down the road, Denethor holding a lanternhigh.  Pipsqueak shuddered gloomily, for it was cold; and he did not atfirst notice Denethor speaking to him.  "...eward Berendan sailed intothe West.  There he came upon the island of the fallen angels, theAngels of Avalon, who live in a great tree covered with white feathersfrom their wings; for the sky is filled with good and bad that mortalsnever know.  They sheltered him, and promised him that if ever the Citywas in danger, they would come up out of the sunrise..."   "Er, what?" said Pipsqueak.  "The sunrise in the west?"   "So the prophecy is told.  And they would fight on behalf of Gondoragainst the Tyrant, the Evil One, and the Dragon of Darkness."   "Um, that's nice," Pipsqueak muttered.  Obviously the old man hadlost his mind.   They came at last to the Silent Street, and entered the House of theStewards.  In this chamber were many stone tables, and on each was asleeping form.  "Suspended animation," hissed Denethor.  At a sign,the servants laid Ariellë down on an empty stone table.  Then Denethorspoke in a low voice.   "Here we will wait," he said.  "But send not for the embalmers, forshe is not dead, and will not die, I think.  While the the Dark Lordrides in force we shall remain here, waiting for the Angels of Avalon,waiting for the eastern glow.  Time will tell us all.   You may go. Farewell!"   "By your leave, lord!" said Pipsqueak and turned and fled.  What adangerous lunatic he thought to himself.  Needs a real goodpsychotherapist.  I had better find Gandalf.  As he came back into thesixth circle the sounds of the bombing returned again to his ears. Missiles were arching high above the walls in flaming streaks, andleaving glaring flashes of electric white where they touched down. Even as he watched on in dismay, three missiles struck within theseventh circle, and with a hideous rumble, the white Castle ofLornavaniwen shuddered and fell into ruin.   Pipsqueak ran on, down, down toward the outer city.  Some folk,seeing his sailor tunic, turned and shouted, but he paid no heed.  Atlast he came into the First Circle, where the fires were still raging. But it had become strangely silent; for a moment, it seemed, theshelling and missile attacks had halted.  No other noise could beheard.   Then suddenly there was a dreadful, high-pitched wail, and a deepechoing boom.  Shaking in fear, Pipsqueak forced himself forward intothe Gate Square.  There he stopped. He had found Gandalf, but couldproceed no further.   Ever since midnight the assault had proceeded apace.   The drums ofthe Flag and Drum corps rolled, while the brass crashed and thetrumpets brayed to the hoarse voices of the Orken army.  Ever and anonthe artillery spat fire against the walls; but their Captain cared notif they actually hit anything, their purpose was only to keep the menof the City busy in many places.  Made by the ancient Atlanteans fromAdamantium, no cannon or missile blast could pierce the armor platingof that wall.  But the weak link in the whole wall was the Gate; andagainst it the enemy was throwing all its strength.   The drums rolled louder, shaking the castle walls.  Tanks crawledacross the field; but on the ground in front of the Gate, reckingnought of any counterattack from the First Wall, were explosive expertssetting up their charges.  Long wires ran back from the Wall to thedetonator.   The drums rolled wildly.  Over the hills of the slain that hadfallen before the gate the Ringwraith rode in black, the Nameless Tenorcome to exult over his foe.   He rode slowly, caring nothing for thechatter of small arms fire that still came from the walls.  He haltedjust before the gate, and removed some sheet music from his breastpocket.  And as he did so a great fear fell on all, defender and foealike, and the gunfire fell silent.  For a moment all was still.   Then in the distance the orchestra began to play, no marching tunethis time, but an aria --- and with that the Black Captain cried aloudin a dreadful voice, singing in some forgotten tongue words of powerand terror to shatter both eardrums and glass:      La donna è mobile qual pium' al vento,      Muta d' accento -    e di pensiero.      Sempre un' amabile   leggiadro viso,      In piant' o in riso, è menzognero.      La donna è mobil' qual pium' al vento,      Muta d' accento -    e di pensier',      e di pensier',    e di pensier'!      è sempre misero   chi a lei s'affida,      Chi le confida -  mal cauta il core!      Pur mai non sentensi felice appieno      Chi su quel seno -   non libo amore!      La donna è mobil' qual pium' al vento,      Muta d'accento -  e di pensier',      e di pensier',    e di pensier'!   And suddenly, on the last shrieking high note, an unseen handpressed the detonator and the Gate of Gondor burst asunder: there wasa flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragmentsto the ground.   In rode the Lord of the Nazdaq, under the archway that no enemy hadever passed without a ticket, and all fled before his face.   All save one.  There sat Gandalf upon his Mordor-made Haug, whichalone among the vehicles of Gondor had failed to start, despiterepeated attempts.   "You cannot enter here," croaked Gandalf, and the Leech-king halted. "Go back to the cheap recording studio prepared for you!  Go back! Fall into the nothingness of low ratings and popular disdain thatawaits you and your Master!  Go!"   The Ringwraith let fall his cloak, and behold!  He was all clad informal evening wear, with white tie and black tail coat.  A conductor'sbaton was in one hand, and a glass of champagne in the other.  Hechuckled drily.   "Old Fool!" he said.  "This is my hour.  Didst thou think thoucouldst upstage me?  Die now, with thy vulgar commercializedentertainment, and curse in vain!"  And with that he lifted high hisright hand and an electric shimmer ran down his baton.   Gandalf still could not start his Haug.  And at that very moment, insome unburnt apartment adjoining the Gate Square, an alarm clock wentoff.  BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP...   Shrill and clear it beeped, caring nothing of opera or rock'n'roll,knowing only that it was set at 6:30 a.m.   And as if in answer there came from far away another sound.  Sirens,sirens, sirens, echoing from the sides of Mount Minnie.  Sirens of thehordes of the North.  Edoras had come at last.
     It was dark and Morrie (Otto) was awakened by the smell of gasoline andburning tires.   He felt the throb in his head and remembered the nightbefore.  He remembered being thrown out of the Winnebago.  "Stupid blonde," hecursed.  "I should have never ridden with her.  Oh, what the heck; I'm Morrie,or someone like that, now, and I'm supposed to go around riding on motorcycleswith hot royalty."     He dimly recall the wild night of riding the bike through the plains ofRohan.  Eowynifred's hair blowing in his face.  The smell of her perfume andWormtounge's liquids on her.  And then the crash.  Eowynifred, in a momentof frenzied ecstasy, had rode the bike so fast that she forgot to watch outfor the King and the dwarves.  She plowed through the dwarves and chargedstraight into HeyHoDen and his mount which had just stopped to take a dump."Stupid blonde..."     Just then Eonard tumbled over Morrie's (Otto's) prostrate form in thedarkness.     "What the hell?"     "Oh, sorry dude, I didn't mean to trip you."     "Sure you didn't.  What the hell are you doing out here anyway?"     "I fell off the motorcycle and just got up.  I was talking to myself."     "Sure you were, you pothead.  Playing with yourself is more like it.  Iswear I heard you say the word blonde..."     After merrily clearing up this mess with Eonard, Morrie (Otto) set out withhim to see what HeyHoDen was up to.  They found the King sitting at thenearest Taco Bell munching on a chalupa while Balin and the dwarves satnearby.     "Stupid pigs, I told then I wanted the damn dog in the commercial, not thechalupa," growled HeyHoDen.     "Now, now," said Balin, "Its better than crap you know."     "Actually I rather prefer crap.  A little ketchup makes a huge difference,you know," commented Wormtounge.     "Shut up, you fool,"  said HeyHoDen.  "We are totally screwed in the ass.Those pigs are gonna catch up with us before we get to Gondor and the Citything."     "Just wish there was some wild man to show us a short cut to -"     Just then a totally naked man jumped in front of them.  He wore nothingbut a feather in his hair and held a crushed Coke can in his hand.  Eowynifrednearly fainted with delight.     "How."     "How?"     "HOW."     "How?"     "How.  I am Sitting Bull of the injuni.  I come to make peace andsmoke weed with the white man."     "Hey, count me in too,"  said Morrie (Otto).     "Listen, you naked old freak," HeyHoDen shouted. "We don't need weed, weneed a shortcut through the woods so that we can plunder Gondor."     "Don't listen to that dildo,"  shouted Morrie, even louder, "Give me thatpipe, man."     The injun reached behind him and with a grunt produced a pipe.     "Ain't nothing like a wide anus to store your pipe in, man," commentedEonard.     Sitting Bull grinned and proceeded to light it up and pass the pipe around.After everyone was totally stoned he proceeded to talk.     "I help you find shortcut.  I show you way to Stoned City.  There youdestroy Magic Mountain and that bastard Denethor.   As he dies tell himnever to throw trash in my forests again.  Then you leave injuni alone totheir pipe-weed smoking.  Aight?"     "Sure thing,"  said Balin. "Lead the way, dude."     "Wait up," shouted HeyHoDen, "what if this naked freak of nature leads usinto a trap and kills us all?"     "Then we'll kill him," said Balin.     "But if we're already dead how are we gonna kill--" muttered Eonard.     "Splendid," shouted HeyHoDen.  "Lead the way, Sitting Bull.  And remember,the only good injun is a dead injun."     The small company consisting of the royal family, Morrie (Otto), thedwarves, and Sitting Bull passed into the forest.  They traveled andtraveled and traveled.  After some time they stopped to view the wonders ofDunland.  They saw Pooh in the honey tree.  "Yum, yum."  They saw thelamppost still burning bright.  HeyHoDen went over for a walk with Aslan andlearned new and interesting ways to impersonate Christ.  Robin Hoodhimself dropped by for a chat and got instantly hooked on Eowynifred.  Heinsisted on calling her Maid Marian and followed her for many miles untilshe utterly rejected him by making sweet love to Sitting Bull.  Robininstantly took his arrow and slit his own wrists, dying in a pool of his ownblood, rejected by a fair lover.  They journeyed on, stopping at fast foodrestaurants and eating plain old crap when there was nothing else.  And sothis relievingly short chapter drew to an end as Morrie (Otto) sat on theground and prepared some "grass" with a couple of injuni who had come alongfor the ride.     "Tomorrow, Gondor and all her riches and glory," muttered HeyhoDenearnestly.     "Can't wait to get my hands on Denethor,"  injected Eowynifred.  "I'veheard that those Stewards are great in bed, way better than the Kings of old -like that sad flab Aragorn, or whatever his name is."     "Oh, man, this weed is great."     "Hell yeah."     "Morrie, when this war stuff is over, I'm coming over to the Shire andgrowing a plantation for myself."     "Hell yeah."     "Good stuff, this pipe weed."     "Hell yeah."     "Don't hell yeah me, you dingaling.  I'm the King, HeyHoDen theMighty Pipe and Bong Smoker."     "Hell yeah."     HeyHoden smiled, lay down in his sleeping bag, farted and started strokingthe lovable hobbit (Otto).     "HELL YEAH."
  As the alarm sounded the Lord of the Nazdaq looked at his watch,proferred an inappropriate expletive for a kid's amusement park and ranout the gate again, muttering something about being late for his lectureon the arts in war.  Seeing this, Gandalf went back to "cheering" thedefenders with his peddler's trick.  His real purpose was of course tosteal their purses while their concentration was elsewhere. Since heabsolutely hates to pick money off a dead corpse, he always tries todo it before they die.  Going back in time a bit, let's look at what really happened beforeHeyHoDen sounded his horns.  As HeyHoDen was galloping towards MinasTirith the injuni leading him saw the cowboys ahead and left indisgust, leaving the Rohirrim suddenly in the front of the battle.Meanwhile his army of seven acrobatic dwarves insisted on making asmall detour by their house which was close by.  When they got there,they went in and left a message that read as follows: Snow White, wehave gone to help HeyHoDen defend Minas Tirith, as soon as you comeback home with your Prince Charming, could you send him along with hisarmy to give us a hand, thank you.  After this small interlude theycontinued their dash towards the battle field, to find it all aflame,and they figured that no one had heard their horns since none stoppedto great them.  At this, HeyHoDen felt that his special greeting forAragon was definitly deserved.  His whole plan rested on Gondorbelieving him to be an ally and thus letting him through the ticketbooth. Once inside, he could safely prepare a greeting for Aragon thathe would remember for the rest of his days - since his days wouldscarcely exceed his entrance into Minas Tirith.    As he was riding hard for the gate, HeyHoDen came by all nine Nazdaq. They were intently listening to one who appeared to be their leader byhis girth. He was rambling on about something, and the words art and warkept coming up pretty often.  While he talked he kept on pointing atdifferent parts of the battlefield and the fortifications.  WhenHeyHoden was level with them he clearly heard him say "break time" andnext thing he knew they were all signing and clapping rhythmically whileone of their number danced jerkily; which brought them all, includingHeyHoden, into fits of laughter, and a weird state of physicalattraction for them.  Sadly for him, HeyHoden learnt that one should notlaugh hysterically or look to the side for too long while riding as hetoppled and his mount fell on him.  His wounds were so extensive thathe had but a few moments of life left.  Close behind him Dirthead tried to reach him while he was still alive,but the chief Nazdaq was in her way.  When he saw her he yelled, "Youmay not pass; we are on a class field trip and have priority, you have tolet us pass!"  This led to a long-winded bickering match on who wouldpass first.  The hissy fight was settled in the following fashion:  "No man as small as you may force me to go against the rules of courtesy!"  Dirthead removed his helmet and answered, "But I am no man, I amEowynifred!" and she nimbly dodged around the huge girth of the Nazdaq toattack him with her secret weapon.  When she reached his back she grabbedonto his underwear, yanked them up and shouted "WEDGIIIIIIIE!".  At thesame time Otto, who had fallen off the Harley, was picking up a sword toineffectively defend himself; but the great girth of the Nazdaq had causedthe wedgie to have terrible effect and he stumbled forwards and onto theblade which Otto was holding up.  It stabbed him straight through the heartand he died instantly.  Try as he might afterwards, Otto could never findhis blade again amidst all the folds of the Nazdaq's stomach.  Seeing theirteacher fall in such a way, the rest of the Nazdaq fled in despair.  Arguing over who had killed the the Nazdaq (they both had good arguments,one being the bearer of the weapon and the other having gotten the Nazdaq tofall), Otto and Eowynifred decided to settle the matter with a fist fight. To their future despair they each managed to knock the other unconscious, andto this day this feud hasn't been settled.   As all of this happened Eonard realized he had been left alone on the battle-field, and tried to find his "army".  He did find them, but HeyHoDen wasalmost dead and the other two were already unconscious.  He went to hisfather who made him swear to kill Aragon at the first occasion he couldfind when he could make it pass as an accident.  Eonard swore and asked hisdying father whether he could do anything to ease his last moments, at whichHeyHoDen replied:  "The only thing which would make me happy is if you found a way to make mydeath fake, or resurrect me (which is quite plausible in this story) so that Imay retired at an old folks' complex, much like the one we passed on our wayhere...."  With that HeyHoDen King of Edoras died.  As he saw the seven dwarves weep forthe late king, Eonard told then not to weep; for now Rohan had a strong king,and he would not have let those pigs desert them, he would have chained them anddragged them behind Harleys to get them to respect his might.  "But no morefretting," he said, "let us join this fray once more to find Aragon!"  So heleft, too happy to be King to care for his safety, and did not see Otto wake up.  Otto awoke painfully. He groggily brought Eowynifred to the city ticket booth,paid the exhorbitant entrance fee, and dragged her to the infirmary; he reallywanted to know how to ride like her.  If he was going to take over Morrie'sdrug cartel, he had to have an awe-inspiring skill like that one.  As the men of Gondor, who by then were totally demoralized byGandalf's lame tricks, saw Eonard fight, they were inspired to performdeeds of glory.  They aranged a sortie with the cowboys of the Pelennor,and started circling the students of Mordor.  To their dismay theyfound out that the graduates and men with black feet and white hands hadbeen kept as reserves by the late rector of Mordor university.  His vicerector, seeing the turn of events, decided to send them in, so that theyin turn started circling the cowboys, but they were obviously going inthe opposite direction as the cowboys were.  From far off on the AnduinAragon's party was rowing up the the river on a barge, their number wasthe same as when they entered the Paths of the Living plus one goofylooking character. However, the current being as it was and they havingonly two paddles, they had a hard time getting there.  But Aragon wasrejoicing; he had read all of Goscinny's books, and he knew how to winthe fight considering the twist it had taken.  He only hoped that JollyJumper would be up to the task.  Babar! Aragon again sneered at HeyHoDen's insolence. Babar! To giveAragon a steed that bore a kingly name! It was as if HeyHoDen was sayingthat Aragon was less-kingly material than his bearer. So it was that atthe first available opportunity Aragon had halted his group, stood beforethe mumak, announced, "I hereby rechristen thee Jolly Jumper", andbroke a bottle of Dom Peregrin across its head. Aragon smiled at the memory.The subsequent memory of the angry mumak picking him bodily up and throwinghim into a tree, and the subsequent pain in his side, he tried with difficultyto forget.  The battle for Gondor went on and on and on. After approximatly 1 hourof rowing, or circling depending on who you listen to, the fight was ended,the cowboys mysteriously turned out victorious, the Mordor students werefleeing, many of them planned on complaining to the Student Society of MordorUniversity (SSMU) for the low quality of their frosh week, and Aragon'sbarge reached the shore.  Seeing a group of five students who seeminglywanted to steal their raft, Aragon directed his meager force into adefensive position, and coordinated the defense from a safe distancebehind his men.  As the last orc died, he rushed towards it and madesure to be splattered with blood; that way he could pretend to have beenin the heat of the battle.  At the same time as the barge reached shoreEonard directed his steed at full speed towards the barge, hoping toreach it on time to pretend a fumble at the same time as he killedAragon.  Sadly, he reached the shore 30 seconds after the last orc diedand his plan fell to shambles. His only option was to pretend to behappy to see Aragon again.  And Aragon was only to happy to explain toall how he had played a crucial part in the fight, and he had a briuse(which he got the last time Jolly Jumper toppled under his weight), andblood all over him (which he poured himself).
  The Leech-king withdrew, blistering the air with curses.  At thatmoment the Haug finally started up again and Gandalf revved theengine, preparing to ride through the gate.  Pipsqueak panicked andran in front it, nearly getting squashed by the tires.  "What the hell are you doing?" screamed Gandalf.  "You nearly gotus both killed!  Besides, is it not a law in the City that those whowear the sailor's shirt must stay in the Citadel?"  "Denethor has gone mad!" cried Pipsqueak.  "He's raving aboutangels or something!"  Gandalf looked through the Gate, and already on the field he heardthe sound of dancing.  He clenched his fist and hoped that the Nazdaqwouldn't steal his entire audience.  "I must go. The Leech-king is abroad and he will yet bring the culture of Mordor upon us," he said.  "But Ariellë!" cried Pipsqueak.  "She is still alive, and they willgas her if we don't stop them!"  "She is alive?" asked Gandalf.  "What are you talking about? Bequick!"  "Denethor has gone to the tombs, and he has taken Ariellë, andhe said life is a gas, and he's waiting for the angels or something. Can't you save her?"  Gandalf muttered something about working right with his plans, andwhy should he leave, which Pipsqueak didn't hear.  Pipsqueak tugged onGandalf's robes and cried, "Don't just stand there, please hurry!"  "I will come," said Gandalf.  "If Ariellë is truly alive, then I'llhave to do something about that."  Then he turned the Haug around andraced up the streets of Minas Tirith.  Then as they approachedthe slopes of Mount Minnie, the streets got to narrow for the Haugand Gandalf left it behind.  Coming to the green door Gandalf passedthrough it and went down the garbage-strewn road that led to theHouse of the Stewards.  Once they reached the House, Gandalf sprang up the steps.  "What isthis madness, Denethor?" he exclaimed.  "The houses of the deadare no place for the living.  Where is your daughter, Ariellë?"  "Madness?" replied Denethor.  "I am not mad, Mesprendeur.  Ifeigned insanity so your friend would bring you here.  And here youwill be tried for your crimes against Gondor.  We may be doomed,but I will make sure you pay the price for dooming us."  Then the room lit up with lights and Gandalf saw that he had indeedbeen decieved.  This was no chamber of the dead, or even cryogenicallypreserved heads, but a courtroom.  "A trial?" he asked in a sneeringtone of voice.  "For what?  I have committed no crimes."  "No crimes?" replied Denethor.  "Mesprendeur, you are chargedwith treason, two counts of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, anda host of other assorted offenses."  "You have no proof," snorted Gandalf.  Suddenly Denethor laughed, and leaped onto a bench.  He reachdunder his robes and drew out a Palantarium.  Pipsqueak gazed at inamazment, for it was smaller than the Palantarium which was given toAragon, though he did not now that this was the famed LaptopPalantarium of which many legends tell.  Then, activating the Valatilë software that had been installed onthe Palantarium, Denethor began to project some images on ascreen behind him.  Pipsqueak gazed upon it with wonder, but Gandalfbegan to feel uneasy about and hoped fervently that the uneasiness didnot show on his shifty face.  "Do I not know thee, Mesprendeur?"laughed Denethor.  "So!  With the left hand you would use me tofurther your own twisted goals, and with the right bring up thisRanger of the North to supplant me."  The image on the screenfocused, and Pipsqueak saw that it was Aragon, at the Falls of Rauros.He claimed to Giggly and Lego-lass that Boromir was dead, andthen kicked the warrior to shut him up when he protested.  "So yourpawn tried to eliminate my son, no doubt on your orders, but it didn'twork.  Boromir lived."  Then the image wavered and shifted, nowshowing Boromir travelling through the Dead Marshes.  "Luckily forme, your Ranger requires a short leash; every time you let him out ofyour sight, he always botches your plans up."  Then the image shiftedagain, showing Boromir falling in a hail of bullets, and thencoming back to life in the Passages of the Dead, with a goofy-lookingface which Aragon had given him.  "I don't know what kind of sick game Aragon is playing; but he willfind becoming king to be difficult, if Boromir still lives. Let's move on."  The image wavered again, and then it showed Gandalftalking to Aragon at Deem's Help.  They spoke in the words of AuldHigh Elvish, which few in the courtroom understood, but the footagehad been edited with subtitles so everyone would know what was beingsaid.  As everyone in the courtroom listened to the conversation,sweat began beading on Gandalf's forehead.  "What else does he have inthat cursed thing?" he thought.  Then Denethor spoke again.  "Sohere we have proof from your own mouth of your treasonous conspiracyto overthrow the lawful government of Gondor."  Gandalf decided it was time to start bluffing.  "Ha!" he said.  "Whohear actually understands Auld High Elvish?  For all anyone knows,Aragon and I could have been discussing barbecue recipies to sharewith the Rohirrim!"  Denethor smiled at him mirthlessly.  "I have more evidence topresent to the court, Mesprendeur."  Then the image shifted to thefoot of Eyesore in Isengard.  Gandalf faced a number of accusations,each worse then the others.  At length he lost his composure, and thenkilled Aruman.  "What the hell?" wondered Pipsqueak to himself. "That's not how I remember it at all!"  But then it all started comingback to him; and he eyed Gandalf fearfully, edging away from him.  While Pipsqueak was remembering what really happened at Deem'sHelp, Denethor went on.  "Aruman discovered your plot and exposed youGandalf, and so you killed him and tried to cover everything up. That's the first count of murder.  As for attempted murder..."  Thescreen then went dark; it was night in Pipsqueak's bedchamber. Gandalf loomed over Pipsqueak's bed, preparing to smother him with apillow, stopped only by the reporters which entered the room a momentlater.  "After your companion revealed the existence of Aragon youtried to kill him, fearing what else he might expose.  It wouldn'thave mattered anyway, Mesprendur, since the Palantarium seeseverything."  Gandalf had in the meantime had been biting his nailsnervously and had given himself a manicure.  Denethor paid him no heed.  "As for the second count ofmurder," he continued.  The screen shifted to the rout fromDisgiliath, just before the Siege began.  "Everyone believes Ariellëwas shot by a Southron during the retreat, but the Palantarium caughtwhat really happened." The screen shifted to Forlong's rescue. Gandalf was riding with them.  As Forlong tried to convince Ariellëthat she had to leave, Gandalf looked around, and then pulled a gunout from under his robes and shot her in the back.  No one noticed inall of the confusion and chaos.  "You arranged the death of Boromir and shot Ariellë yourself tomake sure that Dr Faramir would succeed me, since you've alreadybribed him heavily to follow you.  Ever since Sauron captured you andpaid you off at Dol Guldur, you've been plotting the downfall of theHouse of Hurin.  You may have succeeded, but you will not live toenjoy your success."  Then Gandalf knew he had no other recourse.  He popped a canister oftear gas out from under his robes.  As everyone coughed and choked, heknocked Pipsqueak out, and drawing a knife stabbed everyone else inthe room.  Then he headed through a small door in the back to theboiler room and rigged it to blow.  He raced out of the House and upthe garbage-strewn streets just as the city was rocked by anexplosion.  He looked behind him and saw the remains of the House ofStewards, now gutted with roaring flames.  "That should take care ofthe evidence," he said to himself.  All that survived the explosionwas the Palantarium, but all the incriminating data had been destroyedin the explosion, and it was said afterwards that anyone who lookedinto it saw only the logo of Gondor: a large black circle toppedwith two smaller black circles.  Before waking Pipsqueak up, Gandalf cast a spell of forgetfulnessover him and gave him some false memories to cover up what hadhappened.  But in his haste and nervousness, he forgot a keyincantation.  He shook Pipsqueak awake.  "What happened?" Pipsqueakasked.  "Where am I?"  "Alas!" said Gandalf.  "He lost his mind, and blew up the House ofthe Stewards in his despair.  I barley managed to save you."  "I see," said Pipsqueak carefully.  Now that his head was startingto clear, he remembered what happened in the courtroom; and he realizedthat he had to be careful and keep his mouth shut if he was to stayalive.  They continued on toward the Citadel, and then heard a greatvoice shout, "Wedgiiiie!"  Gandalf hurried over to the wall and sawwhat happened.  "What was that?" asked Pipsqueak.  "It would seem that the great Tenor of our enemies has beendestroyed," he said, "but not without grievous pain, for from thisdeed will arise a great flame war.  So long has the reach of Sauronbecome.  And now I see how his will was able to enter this city. Sauron must have taken the Palantarium from Minas Goofy.  Using thatstone, he must have set up a chat room, where he made his foul planswith Denethor, and probably Aruman as well.  Gandalf looked over the wall again, and saw that Aragon had arrived.  "Now I must go down to the field to greet Aragon and Eonard.  Comewith me!"  Pipsqueak followed quietly.  He hoped Gandalf's planshadn't doomed Frodo, and that working class hobbit - what was his name?Sandy? It didn't matter.  Pipsqueak knew he was the only one who couldsave them all.
     A mist was over Otto's eyes as he stumbled through the smoking ruins of battle, nursing his jaw where Eowynnie had belted him with her heavy mailed glove. He was too tired and sickened by the battle to even begin looting the bodies. Giant siege engines and overturned catering trucks lay burning everywhere, yet he gave them no heed, not even the ones with tuna sandwiches; he followed the gurney of HeyHoDen like a man in a fevered dream.     Morrie! he repeated to himself. I'm Morrie! Not Otto. Morrie! What's the alternative? Go back to being a janitor for the rest of my life when there's an opportunity to become somebody important? I don't understand how the hell it happened, but it doesn't matter. I'm Morrie! Not Otto. I've got to learn more about my adventurous new life. Wow, this city sure looks beat up. I wonder if this is where I live.     The small party passed its way across the field and through the great Gates of Minas Tirith, which were twisted and crumpled like defective aluminum cans. Strings of "E" tickets from the ruined ticket booth coiled across the roadway, and Otto, deep in thought, tripped over them and fell into an alley. When he righted himself and found his way back to the main road HeyHoDen's procession was gone. He stumbled his way through the ashen streets at random, hoping to regain sight of his party, or perhaps a bar somewhere, or maybe a mailbox with his name on it.     "Morrie!" a voice called out to him.     He turned around. A small figure, like a child but wearing the livery of Gondor and no pants, came out of a side-street and dashed up to him. "Morrie!" the figure said again. "Is it really you?"     "Ja," Otto replied, then tried harder to mask his Scandinavian accent. "Uh, yeah," he attempted again gamely. "Frog in my throat. Sorry. Uh. Do I know you?"     "Oh, thank Eru!" Pipsqueak continued, unhearing in his anxiety. "I had hoped I might find you! It's Gandalf! Do you remember Isengard?"     "Oh, ja, ja," Otto blurted out automatically. "Gandalf! Isengard. Remember all about that, meeting you there. Yes, sir. Isengard! Remember it just like it was yesterday."     "You do?" Pipsqueak said. "Oh, good! That's good! I was scared I was the only one who remembered!"     "Nope," Otto said quickly. "Like the back of my hand. Perfect memory. Uhm. So, how've you been, then, Gandalf? Long time since Isengard. Lot of water under the bridge."     "Oh, I've got so much to tell you! But you must have been in the battle. You look terrible!"     "No, I feel fine," Otto replied.     "You look at least a foot taller."     "Uh, no, just new shoes."     "And you've grown a beard."     "Uhm. Accident. Wrong bottle. Rogaine instead of aftershave. That's all."     "And it looks like somebody belted you with a heavy mail glove."     Otto paused. "Well. Uh. Yeah. Yeah, that did sort of happen," he conceded.     Pipsqueak took Otto, soon to be Morrie, by the arm. "I've got to get you to the Houses of Healing," he said. "There you can rest, and we can compare notes about Gandalf. But be careful! He's around, you know, and he has spies everywhere."     "But I thought you-" Morrie began, then stopped himself. He was beginning to feel somewhat disoriented. He allowed the stranger to guide him further and further into the City, past small pocket gardens and numerous aging gift-shops, towards the Houses of Healing. He was lightheaded from the smoke and confused about the identity of the person leading him; and someone named Gandalf was around, and had spies everywhere, which didn't sound too promising as a beginning to a new life. This Morrie thing, he realized, was going to take a little more effort than he had thought. Maybe having a quick lie down wasn't such a bad idea after all.     So it was that Morrie lay in the Houses of Healing, with Pipsqueak keping watch by his side. Gandalf knew this, but not knowing of Pipsqueak's recovered memory he deemed it unimportant. Other, more urgent matters were on his mind. "What do you mean, you don't know where Ariellë is?" he demanded of the nurses. "She was grievously wounded. Near death. They'd bring her here, right? There isn't another Houses of Healing run by another Guild or something, is there?"     "Och, nay, sir," replied the oldest of the women, "the Houses o' Healin' are the only healers, sir, and have been for many long years, what with our having cornered the market on rare herbs an' folklore an' wool blankets an' whatnot, it's a surety ye'll naught be findin' any caregivers other than those o' the Houses o' Healin', an' we run all the franchises an' the little stores what where visitors might be gainin' a foot-plaster or an aspirin or a Band-Aid for when they might have hurts their tootsies walkin' all day or fallin' off a ride, for the Houses ha'e done made the City a warm an' hospitable place for many an Age, an' are one of the few places in these latter days to consistently show a profit-"     "Spare me your fiscal analysis, Iorritant," Gandalf cut in with a wave of his arm, "and your horribly-overdone dialect as well. I've already been through the morgue, and I've inspected the ruins of the House of the Stewards, and she's not dead in either place. If she's not dead, then where the hell is she? Last I saw of her, she wasn't exactly fit to go hang-gliding or deep-sea-oyster collecting. If she's alive, I've got to find her before she can recover! Uh, so I can help her recover, of course."     "Och, nae, nae, good Gandalph," Iorritant began again. "For there is no competition to the Houses o' Healin', like I've sayed. An' there hasn't been in long centuries, nae, not since there was a King in Gondor, for they say the King could heal warts an' make penicillin out o' epoxy an' the like. For The Hands Of A King Are The Hands Of A Healer, the old legends say, an' everyone believes it because it's all capitalized like that an' everything-"     At this Gandalf jumped up suddenly. "Men may long remember your words, Iorritant," he grinned, shaking her hand eagerly and then grabbing his hat. "The fools. Ha ha ha haaa! Wait right here! I'll be right back. And keep the loremasters nearby! I want plenty of witnesses handy!"     Aragon sat in his little pup-tent with Eonard, sharing a bottle of Dunland Slugger's they had found on the field of battle and drinking to the fallen. "But what I still don't unnerstand," Eonard slurred slightly, "is why we're out here in th's Eruforsaken pup-tent when you're supposed to be th' ruler of this whole damn City."     "I deem the time unripe," Aragon said, pronouncing the syllables with grave emphasis. "It would not be well to enter this City while the Stewards still reign, for it would divide the City's loyalities in this its moment of trial. Also the reigning Steward might have me thrown in the dungeon for a century. When Dr Faramir rules the City in peace, however, then shall I make my lineage and my Certificate of Authenticity known to all."     "'S good idea," Eonard agreed, once again taking a draught from the bottle. "'S'noble."     Aragon nodded and reached for the bottle when an arm clad all in white reached through the tent-flap and yanked him by the lapels. "Come on," Gandalf growled in a large stage-whisper. "We've got the opportunity of a lifetime here!"     Gandalf led Aragon quickly through the darkened streets, with Eonard stumbling along somewhere behind them. "But you said I should wait until the Stewards were all out of commission," Aragon whispered. "That I not divide the people in loyalty during this time of strife and all that."     "You never do what I say anyway," Gandalf whispered back. "Listen! They've got these idiotic beliefs about the Kings of old, see? The hands of a King are the hands of a healer and like that. The Stewards haven't got anything like that, not even aspirin concessions. So all you do is do some quick healing, and whammo! Minas Tirith is our baked potato!"     "But those beliefs are true," Aragon began. "The cause of healing is noble. For in the ancient days when our people were beset by the Darkness and ringworm and foot-fungus in the days of Numenor the great King Tar-Palindrome went forth and invented ointment and-"     "Look, forget ointment. Forget noble for a minute," Gandalf interrupted. "Just think healing, okay? One or two quick heals and we'll be on top of the oyster, whether Ariellë is alive or not."     "Ariellë?" Aragon asked, stumbling in mid-step at the name. "Not the same Ariellë who-"     "No! That was somebody else! She's nobody," Gandalf sneered. "Look. Forget it. You just do some Kingly-type healing, okay? Let me take care of the rest."     Soon later they were led to Faramir's chamber. The Doctor lay on his back in the small stifling room, pierced by the many nightmarish wounds of the Black Helicopters and a single, conspicuously ordinary knife-wound in his back. Aragon knelt by the bed while Gandalf stood nearby, making sure there was a crowd of witnesses just outside the door. "My lord Faramir is hurt most grievous," the aging Loremaster intoned through false teeth. "He is suffering from what the Atlanteans once referred to as feagurth, or mortalius in the Northern dialects, sometimes called spirgrache in Edoran, or kifo-smyerte in the Russo-Swahili, or ilbloob-looblooblOObb to the Betelgeusean-"     "What you're saying," Aragon interrupted pointedly, "is that he's dead."     "Uh, well, yes," the Loremaster replied, "not to put too fine a point on it. Actually, he was already dead when we brought him in this morning."     "Then why," Aragon asked angrily, "have you put him in a bed?"     "Uh. Well." The Loremaster had the decency to look embarassed. "Well, y'see, his health insurance still had some credits on it, what with him being a member of the Family of Stewards and all, and, well, we figured that, what with one thing and another, with all these heating bills to pay, if we gave him a room for a few days we could charge him for it and-"     "Say no more!" Aragon said, appalled. "Oh, there's going to be some reorganization when I come into power-"     "Look, forget that," Gandalf cut in, stepping in hastily and rubbing Aragon's shoulders like a coach readying a prize boxer. "Time for all that later. Time to heal, okay? Get in there and heal!"     Aragon nodded and went to the bed. For a time all was silent. Aragon knelt by the body and hummed a quiet mournful tune, just on the edge of hearing, which brought to those nearby a vision of green fields and gentle spring breezes and Willie Nelson. Then he put a hand upon Faramir's brow and whispered, "Doctor Faramir! The King commands. Come back! Come back, Faramir!"     For an hour and yet another the vigil went on. Aragon's voice slowly grew quieter, and it seemed to those watching that he was wandering in some faraway country, searching for Faramir, looking under invisible rocks and draining unseen bogs, and at last whittling a megaphone out of some unseen wood so that he could shout further. Gradually more and more of the Healers stopped in the doorway and stood in amaze, chiefly because once they showed up Gandalf refused to let them leave. Then, just as the observers were being driven to the end of their patience, Aragon stood. It seemed to those nearby that he looked as one fatigued by a long struggle, for his face was grey, and he had a leg cramp. He looked hard upon Dr Faramir's peaceful and quiet features, and sighed; and finally he looked to Gandalf and the Loremaster, who anxiously awaited his pronouncement.     "Uh, you're right," Aragon said simply. "He's dead, all right. No question."     The faces of the Healers were alight with amazement, not to mention anger, with some sheer frothing annoyance thrown in for good measure. Among their grumbles and yells could be heard the shrill highly-pitched rodent trap of a voice which was Iorritant's. "'Cor, what a bloody waste of time that was," she exploded. "Some 'ealer that one turned out to be! About as useful as eggplant in a snowstorm, that one. 'E's even worse than Reaver. Remember ol' Reaver and that amputation 'e did for that case o' the chills-"     "Shut up! Shut up!" screamed Gandalf, overriding the din. "Okay, bad example, I admit. But the guy was already dead, okay? Look, let's go to someone who's just grievously wounded this time."    Eowynn lay silent and unmoving, her eyes gazing up at the ceiling. Her face was deathly white except for a red mark upon her temple which strongly resembled the emblem on Morrie's helmet. Eonard stood beside the bed, distraught both by the emptiness of his sister's eyes and the more poignant emptiness of his bottle. "She was found on the field near HeyHoDen," the Loremaster garbled. "Though she was merely hit by some wayward soldier's helm, she will not awaken. I fear there is some greater mischief at work. We have been unable to give her aid, largely due to fear of heightened malpractice premiums."     "Greater evils are at work here," Aragon explained. "For who among mortals could yank the Black Underwear and not take grievous hurt? And yet there is more here than this one day's sorrow. Is that not so, Eonard?"     "Indeed, yes, lord Arag'n," Eonard replied almost soberly. "For she was grown disgusted with Edoras, and the foul enchantments o' Wormbreath were upon her, and her name has been arbitrarily changed every time she's appeared in a chapter. And being trampled by King HeyHoDen's honor guard when they were picking up the King's body probably didn't help either."    Aragon nodded, and again knelt by the body. He watched her quietly for some time, particularly her breasts which held his attention for a great while. Then, evidently satisfied that she really was breathing, he muttered a low incantation and drew from his pouch some thin green leaves, which he broke in his hands and dropped into a bowl of water. A sharp smell of basil filled the room, tangy and refreshing. Aragon followed it up with some garlic, fresh tomatoes, dill, finely diced onion and a touch of ginger. He sent someone for Ricotta cheese and some fettucini. Then he called softly to Eowynn, saying there would be Italian food and that she would miss it all if she slept through it. He called her by her many names: Eowynn, Eowinnie, Eowynifred, Dirthead, Hey You In The Back With The Eyeliner. He touched her brow and held her hand. He would have given her a vigorous chest massage if there hadn't been so many people standing around. Finally in desperation he stood up and slapped her very hard, several times, whilst screaming her name. Eonard then grabbed his arm and shot him a glance which looked remarkably sober. He stopped. He nodded.     "It is not right for me to wake her," Aragon wisely observed. "For her brother should perform that honour. It would only grieve Eowinnie to wake up to see me: virile, manly, yet unavailable. Nope, nope, no no no; the Right and Noble course is to leave Eowynn in Eonard's capable hands!" And just as the assembled witnesses began to howl in protest Aragon beat a hasty retreat out of the chamber, Gandalf following mere inches behind him.     Boromir lay groggily, fevered and wounded, and still smelling of seaweed. "His case is most grave," the Loremaster monotonously droned, annoyed that he was being given all the exposition. "Between the mumak, the near-drowning, the coral reef and the barnacles, his case is most bitter indeed. Not that the king couldn't handle it, of course," he added, with a vituperative look at Aragon.     "Fear not!" Gandalf said airily. "Piece of cake." Moving closer to the worried Aragon, he quietly added: "No problem here. You already resurrected him back in Chapter Two. And do you know how many times he's been killed already? Hell, this man won't stay dead even if you drive a spike through his chest. You could electrocute this man with twenty thousand volts, cut his body into tiny little pieces, soak them in acid and fling them into mighty Anduin and then invalidate his trademark and he'd still recover before the ink was dry on the page! Trust me, I've seen it happen." Aragon nodded once and made for Boromir, and had scarcely touched his arm before the Great Man of Gondor bellowed:     "AaaarrowwwwphnagaaaaooooooOOOWWWWwwwwwwwwww!"and immediately convulsed, fell heavily on his face on the floor, and lay still.     There was a long silence.     "So, uhm... is he cured, then?" Gandalf asked.     "Owww, 'e's not breathin'!" Iorritant began to squall, in a voice shrill and loud enough to be heard over half of Gondor despite Gandalf's sudden urgent attempts to shush her. "That Aragon bloke 'as killed that nice Mr Boromir! Och, now that's as incompetent a job o' healin' as Oi've ever seen in all me days. And to think that Gandalph thought 'e could heal people better than us! And wasted our entire evening! 'Cor, what a pig! It's good work 'e couldn't find Ariellë; an' he was lookin' for her, mind you. About as adept a healer as hittin' yourself on the foot with a big rock, I says." This Iorritant said and much much more besides, and the rumour of Aragon's incompetence and Gandalf's stupidity was carried through the night as if by public-relations agents being paid by the word.     Pipsqueak, already nervous, jumped about a foot when Gandalf and Aragon suddenly thrust open the door and pushed their way in; but thinking quickly he pretended he was just worried about the sleeping Morrie. "There's something different about him," the hobbit explained, desperately trying to avoid Gandalf's eyes. "He's been talking in his sleep, which isn't Morrie at all; and he's been saying things about brooms and window cleaner and ordering new mop-heads before the morrow." And as Gandalf and Aragon turned to the bed he took one last apologetic glance at Morrie, slipped quickly out the door and ran into the night.     "It may be the blow to his head has harmed his mind," Aragon intoned. He reached over to touch Morrie's brow and said in a commanding voice: "Moribund Brandybottle. Awake!"     "Ja, ja," Morrie said immediately, opening his eyes easily. "Morrie! That's me. What d'you need, mister?"     "Ah-HA!" Aragon laughed, turning quickly to the doorway; but there were no witnesses, as Gandalf could no longer restrain them after the Boromir incident. With a sigh he returned to Morrie and held up a hand. "How many fingers?" he asked.     "All of them," Morrie replied cleverly.     "How's your memory? Forget anything? Names? Debts?" Aragon continued.     "Hah! Not me," Morrie happily told the strangers. "Mind like a steel trap. I remember everything."     Gandalf, who had only been listening with half an ear, suddenly was all attention. "Everything?" he asked, his expression dark. "You remember everything?"     "Ja, ja," Morrie replied happily. "Everything. Perfect. Clear as a bell."     "Including Isengard?" Gandalf demanded.     "Oh, ja!" Morrie grinned. "I was just thinking about Isengard. I remember the whole thing! Top to bottom. No memory lapse there."     "Ah. Well, that's good to know," Gandalf said airily. He proceeded to the door. "Guard!" he yelled. "This Halfling has the Plague. Put him in an isolation tank and allow absolutely no one to speak to him!"     "Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn," Gandalf groused a moment later in the deserted hallway. "You really botched that job up. Not even Boromir! My Eru, my dog could resurrect Boromir. A guy can't keep Boromir from being resurrected. But you just look at him, and whammo! Fit for burial! You stupid, toadying imbecile." He opened a chamber door at random and they stepped in.     "I healed the halfling," Aragon pointed out.     "I wish you'd healed him like the others," Gandalf snapped irritably.     "I don't understand," Aragon mumbled. "These are the hands of a King. They should have healed! What went wrong, I wonder? Was it the pressure? Too many witnesses? Performance anxiety? It's a good thing I don't work in porn films."     "I don't know how the hell I'm going to get you installed as King now. You stupid bastard." Gandalf sat down on the bed and was greeted by a scream of pain from a soldier with a broken leg. Aragon rolled his eyes in exasperation and grabbed the man by the lapels with one regal hand.     "You. Get out. We're talking."     "Yes, my Liege," the soldier said, jumping up and walking out quickly.     "Absolutely incompetent. Absolutely bloody incompetent," Gandalf went on, not noticing, angrily concentrating on lighting his pipe. "Now if you'd tried to heal Ariellë, that might have worked in our favour. But she's still out there somewhere, damn it, and so we need a new plan." The match broke in his hands and a burning fragment skittered across the floor. "New plan. Totally different angle. Like... damn, that was my last match. Have you got a match?" He looked at Aragon and then strode angrily out to the hallway. "Hasn't somebody in this Eruforsaken dump got a fucking match?" he screamed at the top of his lungs; and his voice echoed and reverberated off the stone walls.     "You've got the Ring of Fire," Aragon reminded him quietly.     "Yeah, but it needs a new flint," Gandalf grumbled. "Okay. Healing wasn't it. But we've got to get you doing something Kingly, or else you'll never be accepted by this rabble. Damn it. We need a new plan."
  Pipsqueak woke up from a deep sleep, thinking he had heard somebody callhis name. As he lay there in the darkness, he heard it again: Paragraph Took,hear my voice! At first he thought it was Gandalf, but this voice wasdifferent; it was full of warmth, love, and sympathy, so much unlikeGandalf's nervous babbling. This voice spoke the truth and Pipsqueak wouldlisten to it and obey what it would command.  Beware! Gandalf has betrayed you all. Frodo must not be allowed tocomplete his mission, and you are the only one who can stop him. Find anEagle whose heart is pure, and fly to Mount Doom. You must stop Frodo at allcost; for if you don't, all of Muddle-Earth will fall into darkness!  "Sss... uh, Aruman??" whispered Pipsqueak with trembling voice. He sprangup, but there was nobody at the room, but as an echo he still could hear:Even the smelliest personnnnn...  Hand in hand, like lovers do, giggling Giggly and leggy Lego-Lass waltzedinto the City, after morning came; for she wanted to do some shopping, andfolk that saw them pass marvelled to see such an open display of inter-racial affection; for long had Minas Tirith been yoked by a strictmoral code of the Stewards.  "There are endless lines of toy-stores here," said Giggly looking around."But none for the adults, if you know what I mean. When Aragon takes over, Iwill talk to him about opening a chain of erotic-shops, selling finesthandmade Dwarvish instruments of pleasure."  "They need more strip-clubs and escort-services too," said Lego-Lass."When Aragon liberates the City, the people of the Wood will send to himtheir best exotic dancers, and courtesans who won't hesitate in performingany act."  Their casual conversation was interrupted by Arwen, who came running afterthem. "Where the hell is my beloved Aragon?!" she said. "He's nowhere in thecamp, and his bed hasn't been slept on whole night! That bastard better havea good explanation for this." The warrior maiden was unconsciously squeezingher sabre-hilt with her knuckles white.  "Hard to say," said Lego-Lass with false sincerity. "Is there anall-you-can-eat buffet anywhere nearby?" Giggly giggled uncontrollably, andArwen gave a menacing glance to the grinning Elven-maid. "Ok, ok. Justkidding," she continued. "I think he's with Gandalf. They seemed to haveplanned to hold some kind of meeting at the conference-room on the top-floorof the Tower. Gandalf specifically warned everybody not to tell you..."  "That treacherous Wizard is up to no good again!" Arwen bit her lip. Thenthe expression in her face brightened. "If I stop his evil plans, I canstill be the hero of the third movie!" With this she leaped up and rushedaway, pushing surprised guards aside.  "She's such a bitch!" said Lego-Lass. "I hate her, I really do."  "Never mind that," said Giggly. "Come over here and tell me who youlike!"  They were standing outside the ancient citadel where once great film-moguls had dwelled, and the morning-sun shone upon them. The air ofthis sacred place seemed to be filled with history and memories of theglorious days of yore, which seemed to demand respect and quiet awe.  "Take me, Giggly," cried Lego-Lass. "Right here at the heart of the oldMagic Kingdom!"  And he took her, and he cared not that they were on an open place in thesight of many. And many indeed saw them, and even more heard the noises theywere making as they plighted their troth and were glad until the guards cameand arrested them for Public Naughtiness.  The Dwarf and the She-Elf were taken to the guardhouse, where they weregiven their one errand-call and then locked in the Cell of Poor Hygiene.When Lego-Lass looked out of the small window of their cell, she could seestrange things flocking around the empty marketplace, pecking a toscansalami.  "Look!" she cried. "Goons! They are far from Studio 5. A wonder they areto me, and an annoyment such as I never have felt. Alas! For the goons andtheir yin-tong cries. No peace shall I have again in mortal lands."  She sighed, and sitting down on a bench covered with filthy hay, began tosing softly:    There's a song that I recall, my Mother sang to me    She sang it as she tucked me in, when I was ninety-three...  She was interrupted by a guard banging the door. "Shut up in there, youbum!" he shouted. "Your lawyer is here to see you."  "Ai-ai!" said Lego-Lass.  The guard opened the door, and in walked a small, hooded figure. Dwarf andElf looked at the hooded stranger with amazement. "Leave us!" he told theguard, with a voice that for some reason sent shivers through theirintestines. The Guard grumbled but snatched the silver coin the strangertossed to him, and closed the door behind him. The stranger turned to thetwo friends and removed his hood dramatically.  "Oh, it's you, Morrie," said Giggly. "What brings you here?"  "Don't mention that name here!" said Morrie, and a shadow of nervousnesspassed by his face as he glanced at the door. "The name of Brandybuck isfeared and loathed widely in these lands, and someone might recognise me.While we are here, my name is Mr. Moriarty, a local solicitor."  "Sure, whatever," said Lego-Lass. "Say... weren't you supposed to be afoot taller then before and have a beard? Just something I overheard at thecampfire."  "Naah. That's just some guy I suckered to come over here as a decoy, sothat my disappearance wouldn't arouse too much attention. As he is nowsafely locked away, I have free hands to carry out my masterplan without anyinterruptions. And you can help me with that. You like money, don't you?"  Lego-Lass and Giggly looked at each other. In their dreams they couldalready picture themselves sharing a luxurious dream-house on one of theparadise-islands of the Tampalas Bay, all paid up with dirty drug-money...  "We're in!" they said in unison.  "Great," said Morrie, or Mr. Moriarty as he was now called. "Just wait abit, and I'll get you out of here." He knocked on the door, and the guardopened it.  "Aww, now I didn't get to tell about our journey through the Paths ofLiving, and the tragic misfortune that came over Boromir," sighedLego-Lass.  "Good thing too," said Giggly. "For upon that road I was put to shame:Giggly Groin's son, who had deemed himself having a stronger bladder thenany Men or Elf..."  "I admit, the Ancient Toons were hilarious to look upon," saidLego-Lass. "And with Boromir walking ahead of them with his new face,there was no friend nor enemy who would not fall to the ground convulsedwith laughter, save Lord Droopdawg of Lamedog, who remained in seriousmelancholy. Perhaps the stories are true, and he is partly a toon himself.But the Pirates of Tampalas would have gotten away, had it not been forBoromir, who got hold of their ship and formed a living bridge, allowingthe rest of us to charge over his back and into the ship. But alas! Aragonand his Mumak were too much for him to bear. I hope he's getting betternow."  "I see no reason why not," replied Giggly.  Presently the Captains were starting their debate, high above the commonriff-raff, at the Tower of Ethel. All the remaining nobles of Gondorwere present, as were the twin-sons of El-Rond; and Aragon who presentedhimself as an already crowned King even though presently that was not yetaccepted in any way by many of those who were present. But it was Gandalfwho presented the first presenting.  "My lords," said Gandalf to those who were present, "listen to the wordsof the Steward of Gondor before he died, in which I had no part:Gandalf is a great guy. He's so wise and so noble, and wants only goodthings for Gondor. If should it happen that I lose my mind and killmyself, in which he will have no part, he should be put in charge andeveryone should just do whatever he says. I would like you all to know thatwith heavy heart I accept this gravest duty."  This aroused some angry murmur from the side of the nobles of Gondor.Dr. Imrahil and his twin brother Prince Armadillo® (of whom nobody couldremember which one was evil) both sprang up ready to object when Aragonslammed down Endurit, cleaving the table in half. The nobles went quiet,and Gandalf continued. "Good. That is settled then. I shall rule you all inthe days that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy. Now! Despitewhatever others may have told you, it is obvious that we have no hope to standagainst Sauron with arms. Sooner or later his overwhelming armies wouldcrush us no matter what we do. Resistance is futile, you know..."  "Then you wish we would just give in to Sauron??" said Hurly the Keymasterand his twin-brother Curly the Backdoor-Master simultaneously.  "Uh, basically yes," said Gandalf. "The only way for us to proceed isunconditional surrender. And as a token of our good will, all the noblesof Gondor shall be given to Sauron as hostages who will be executed ifwe don't agree to whatever he demands."  "Don't worry," he continued, grinning evilly at their shocked faces. "KingAragon and myself will see that everything goes well while you're away. Haveno fear. This is only a cunning ploy to buy time for the Ringbearer tofinish his task. When Sauron is destroyed, you all shall be heroes!Posthumous Heroes, with any luck... Whoops, did I say that out loud?"  So powerful was the effect of Gandalf's voice that the nobles actuallystarted leaning toward his suggestions, when suddenly the door was slammedopen, and in walked three incredibly sexy females followed by a hooded man.Gandalf gazed in terror at Ariellë, but before he could say anything Eowynnspoke up, directing her words at Aragon.  "All these years, father!" she said. "Why didn't you tell me? Why??"  "Oh, I don't think he knows about it," explained Arwen, as if theexpression in Aragon's face would not make this painfully obvious. "El Rondmanaged to hide it from everybody. Except me of course. But it is true.Eowynn is your daughter, Aragon. Perhaps you remember the days you spentboozing in Edoras some twenty years ago? The one night you ended up passingout next to your drinking-buddy Eomondo's horny young wife, and woke up nextmorning feeling dirty? Eowynn got started that night, although you are notto blame.  "But there is more," continued Arwen. "Ariellë is your twin sister. Youwere separated when young, for your own protection. Ariellë was placed inSteward's family so that she could get the best possible Gondorianupbringing. You, on the other hand, ended up on that pig-farm of Butterball'shalf-brother where Dad found you... And since Ariellë is a few minutesolder then you, it is she who is the rightful Heir of Isildur and the newruler of Gondor."  "Do something!" whispered Gandalf to Aragon, but all he could do was tostare from Ariellë to Eowynn and back while mumbling "She's my sister,she's my daughter. She's my sister, she's my daughter..." over and overagain.  "This is ridiculous!" cried Gandalf himself. "Where's your proof?"  "Right here!" said Arwen and pointed to the cloaked figure. The manremoved his hood, and lol! it was Boromir. Boromir as he should be;alive and well, more goofy-faced then ever.  "Hands of the King are hands of the healer," said Arwen. "Ariellëresurrected him in the presence of many witnesses. She is the rightful Queenof Gondor!"  The nobles cheered and looked relieved.  "What commands the Queen?" asked Arwen smiling and touched Ariellë's armgently.  "As Aragon has begun, so I will go on," said Ariellë. "Let none nowreject the counsels of Gandalf, whose long labours come at last to test. Wewill make a peace with Sauron - a honest and fair, mutually satisfactorypeace, with no hidden agenda. We will find a way for Culture andEntertainment to co-exist, and Capitalism to flourish alongside socialwelfare and respect for the nature: what Aruman called the Third Path. Nowprepare yourself, for tomorrow we shall all march to the great PeaceConference at the Black Gate!"  The nobles cheered again, and Gandalf looked on with sour face as theyfollowed Ariellë out of the room. Eonard lead the still-weeping Eowynn bythe hand, and he gave Aragon a nasty look as they went by him. And it seemedthat even the sons of El Rond were abandoning him. At least Arwen stillloves me, thought Aragon to himself as she stopped at the door and turnedto speak to him.  "Did I mention that I am breaking off our engagement?" she said. "Alas,you have somewhat lost your charm lately, and now you have lost your Kingdomtoo. It would seem that Ariellë is the most powerful lesbian in town now, soI guess I'll be taking my chances with her. Toodle-oo!"  Gandalf and Aragon were left alone in the room. Aragon was sobbing quietlyand munching his comfort-choklit. "No need to worry," said Gandalf bitinghis lip. "There will be no peace after Frodo destroys the Ring." Aragonlooked at him, surprised.  "You see, the Ring contains Sauron's Mojo," explained Gandalf, "and withhis Mojo out of the way he will lose any interest in music, arts andlovemaking; and then he'll be able to concentrate on being the Evil DarkLord as he is supposed to! When that happens, Ariellë will look like a foolor a traitor. And who then will the people turn to? They will turn to us!"  Gandalf laughed diabolically, and the look on his face was so evil thatAragon begun to move away from him. But Gandalf grasped him by the shirt.  "It's too late to back off now," he said. "You're in this too deep already.Besides, you shall see that Arwen will come crawling back, when you are madethe King. You better just stick with me..."  Suddenly he let go and turned around. Boromir had appeared to thedoorway. "So that's your plan, eh?" he said. "You would use the threat ofSauron to keep the West under your control, and use all of us as yoursockpuppets! Well I will be no Wizard's tool! I'm telling everyone aboutyou!"  "Sure. Go ahead, I won't stop you," said Gandalf. "I know when the game islost... Oh, one thing. Before you go, how about you take a look out of thewindow?"  "I don't mind if I do," said Boromir.  From his hideout, Pipsqueak watched in terror as Gandalf casually pushedBoromir out of the window. As Boromir's cry broke down to a loudthump, Gandalf turned to Aragon and said: "Let us hurry! If we get to himfirst, you can try resurrecting him one more time!"  As they left the room, Pipsqueak crawled out of his hiding place and stoodtrembling in the middle of the room. "Aruman was right all along!" hethought to himself. "And now I'm the only one who knows the truth. But whatcan I do? Where will I find courage? I can't go on alone..."  And again he heard, like a whisper in the wind, a voice from another placeand another time.  Yogurt will always be with you...
   "Arwen!  Arwen!"  A rapidly approaching hobbitish voice accompaniedby the absence of the flapping of bare feet on the flagged street madethe Elf-maiden turn.  It was Pipsqueak.   "Arwen!  I must talk to you.  Someplace where you-know-who can'toverhear us."   "Very well.  First you can tell me what you're on.  Why aren't yourfeet touching the ground?"   "Morrie and I had Ment-draught in Fungang.  We've been hovering likethis ever since.  Didn't you notice at Isengard?  Look-"   "Last I saw Morrie he was not hovering.  Houses of Healing, as theymarched him into quarantine.  He was a foot or two taller than you buthis feet were on the ground."   "..."  Pipsqueak suddenly looked puzzled.  "Now you mention it, therewas something different about him after he came in from the battle.That too, now you mention it.  Well, no matter.  Probably just hiswounds.  Look-"   "In here."   As they stood in a deserted old souvenir shop, Arwen turned her gazeupon the squeaky hobbit.  "Well?"   "It's Gandalf.  He's up to no good.  He-"   Drily: "I had noticed."   "He-killed-Aruman-he-killed-Boromir-he-wants-to-kill-Ariellë.He-wants-Sauron's-Ring-destroyed-but-this-will-only-turn-Sauron-evil-again-he-"   "Woah!  Slow down, Pitya.  He killed Aruman?"  She fixed her intensegaze on the little one.   Pipsqueak explained, suddenly calm and focussed.  Arwen's gaze grewmore intense.   She said: "I was there.  I have blurred memories of that day, but Idon't remember him killing Aruman.  I remember Aruman deserving it."   "I remember better than you.  I had a memory freshener whenDenethor put Gandalf to trial.  I saw all on Denethor'slaptop Palantarium.  Then Gandalf threw a smoke grenade, killed all butme, and made an explosion to cover up the evidence.  He thinks I'veforgotten all of that, or I should be dead now.  Think back, Arwen,think back!  Remember his expertise with drugs, and remember that hepassed a bottle round among us."   There was a pause.  Arwen's gaze grew distant, then pained.  Then ithardened.  And hardened.  And hardened even more, until she looked moreperilous than Pipsqueak had ever seen the warrior maiden before.Suddenly, remembering his childhood, he wished fervently that Arwen hadbeen his mother ---   --- for a moment he had that expression that children often imagineon a puppy-dog in a pet shop: adopt me!  Arwen noticed, smilinginwardly; then: not yet, you idiot, remain unfettered a whilestill ---   --- then she relaxed a smidgen and took a deep breath.   "And Boromir?"   "I saw him push Boromir out of the window.  I was hiding in theconference room where you told Aragon about his family relations."   "Then I can reassure you.  That boy is a toon.  Normal people fallingtwenty meters onto stone will turn into rattle-sacks of broken bone andblood.  I have seen it more than once in battle in the mountains.Boromir - didn't you forget the ? - made a hole in the street andclimbed up from it.  Showing his true self, finally.  I saw it.  Manydid.  But I'm not surprised that Gandalf would try.  He wants to killAriellë?"   Pipsqueak explained.   "Destroying Sauron's Ring will make him evil again?"   Pipsqueak explained.   "What more?"   "He tried to kill me, but was interrupted.  Then he tried to make meforget with magic, and he thinks that he did it.  He also killedDenethor.  I shouldn't be surprised if he is after you next."   "I should.  If he tries, the surprise shall be his.  Briefly.  IsAragon part of this?"   "Yes, at least partly.  Gandalf wants to install him as King ---"   "That is old news."   "I think Gandalf has some sort of hold on him, and he doesn't tellhim everything."   "I should think so.  The Aragon that I loved was a bit shady, butwould never have stooped to such evil."   Then Pipsqueak took a deep breath.  "Have you seen the Star Warsmovies?"   "Yes?"   "You know how Obi-wan was killed but could still advise Luke withsome sort of disembodied voice?"   "Yes."   Another deep breath.  "I think Aruman is still around in the same wayas that.  He has talked to me.  He wants me to find an eagle and send itto Mount Doom and prevent Frodo from throwing the Ring in."   A short pause.  Then: "Ah.  Leave it to me.  Pitya, you have donevery well in telling me."   "Boromir!  I thought I..."   "Killed me?  Can't be done.  Do you know what rabbits are like?  Toonrabbits are worse.  Mother knew one called Roger."   Gandalf sighed, reached into the recesses of his robes, then produceda small bottle.   "Ink eraser?"   "Yes, Aragon, ink eraser."   But when Gandalf returned his attention to Boromir, there was only aBoromir-shaped hole in the stone wall, silhouetted arms frozen inmid-flail.  Peering through it, they saw a progression of Boromir-shapedholes through the other walls clear to the outer one.  Some ball-shapeddust clouds slowly dissipated along the beeline.  A cry of meep-meepaccompanied by the sound of an engine faded into the distance towardsthe River.  Boromir would not soon warn Gondor against Gandalf.   "What's with the meep-meep," asked Aragon.  "This is a Disney placerun by a Disney-franchise family, right?"   "Toon humour."   Sitting on a stone parapet, Pipsqueak was reading.  So consumed washe that he didn't notice the figure approaching him from behind until ahand grabbed his shoulder.  "Still reading that feminist bastard,Pipkin?"   "Morrie!"  A swift look down.  "And hovering again, like me!  How didyou escape quarantine?  You never should have let Gandalf know-"   "Never stopped hovering.  It's Otto you mean, pretending to be me.Not very good at it, or he wouldn't have been in the isolation tanknow."   "Sweet Jesus!  I should have guessed!  Who is Otto?"   "Yes, you should.  Would the real Moribund Brandibuck have been soconfused?  But let the saps think the real Morrie is in the cell.  Youknow my family's rep in these parts, whatever we've done to earn it.I'm Moriarty now.  Solicitor.  See who I brought with me?"   "Yeah.  Why d-don't you do it in the road, you two?"   Pipsqueak swung his legs across the parapet and jumped down on theflags.  "Look," he whispered.   "Stop whispering.  These two love-birds are part of the plan."   "Oh are they?  Well, how far have you come?"   "Two inches away from contacting Aragon.  I need him to give me ashellfish export license from Tampala Bay to the Shire."   "Oh, I wouldn't pull Aragon into it," replied Pipsqueak.  "He is neckdeep in shit already and getting cold feet about it.  He might try to dothe righteous thing and stop you.  Just to soothe his conscience bydoing something right these days.  He would guess what you want toput into those shellfish of yours.  Or Gandalf might get wind of it.  Hewould not stop you.  He would take over.  You think your family isruthless?  They must have taken classes from Gandalf, the oldmotherfucker."   Pause.   "Pipsqueak!  What has gone into you?  Swearing?"  Morrie grinned.The love-birds blushed.  Dwarves blush by their beards stiffening, sinceso little of their facial skin can be seen.  Giggly's beard was like asteel brush.   "I've grown, Morrie.  Faens kuse i rddryppende drittfitte-"   "Point taken, if maturity is cued by adult cussing.  Which itisn't, it takes more.  What's wrong with Gandalf, that we didn't know ofbefore?"   Pipsqueak drew his breath, and let drive.   Afterwards, as the three others stood fuming, he smiled to himself.I am like a contagious virus against the wizard.  Whenever I comeacross one of those present at Aruman's death, I make them remember likeI do.   "Arwen!"   Coldly: "Yes?"   "Arwen.  Do you still want to marry a king, or a queen?"   "Yes."   Aragon sighed.  "Then you did right in ditching me.  Gandalf has aplan.  I serve in it. I'm confused.  I'm tired of it.  All this schemingand killing.  Now he wants to restart the war between Gondor andMordor.  That's why he wants the Ring melted down, if you'll believe it.Arwen, that's not the price I want to pay for the throne.  The price Iwant Gondor and its people to pay, I mean.  Shitshitshit."  Heturned and left.   Softly, Arwen called after him: "How much weight have you lost?  Isee you have lost some."   "Then you see with sharp eyes," replied Aragon without turning back."I outweigh one horse fewer than yesterday, that's all.  My appetite isgone, and I don't much miss it."   "Arwen!"   Warmly: "Yes?"   "I have thought about this.  You want to be with me when I becomequeen?"   "You will need me when you become queen."   "Two queens in one hive is trouble.  You, Arwen, cannot be thequeen's consort and not in practice be queen yourself, that is evident."   Pause.  "Yes."  Another pause.  "We would always be fighting."  Onemore pause.  A grin.  "And you would constantly lose."   Coldly: "I might lose one fight.  Then I should give an order, andlose no more fights against you."   "So you choose between me and the rule of Gondor, and you choosethe rule?  Sensible."   "Exactly.  Glad we see eye to eye.  The last two nights werepleasant, but that is not enough."   "Aragon, my boy!"   "Yes, Gandalf?"   "You have lost weight.  That is not good."   "My knees are happy with it.  So is Babar."   "Then eat Babar.  You must reach a pondus worthy of a king."   "I have weight worthy of a whole platoon of kings, and you can seeit!  A little more of this and I can outlard a whole division oflairds."   Coldly: "Consider it an order."   Even more coldly: "Give it to yourself.  The order for food.  Yoube king!"   "Aragon!"   But Aragon had turned and was leaving.  Gandalf tried to rush pasthim and face him down, but the walk around proved too far.  Then hegrabbed Aragon by the shoulder to force the fat man to turn back andface him.  He might as well have tried to turn a small planet.  Frombeyond the bulk before him he heard Aragon's voice: "Maybe I'm a toontoo.  A normal mortal could not be so fat and live."  Then, in abrighter voice: "And you have not enough eraser to be a threat to me."   "Aragon!  Hey, Aragon, wait!"   "Why?"   Arwen was far more agile than Gandalf.  She could leap onto the roofof a bus, and often had.  Twice in London.  She could even leap ontoAragon, and she did now.  For a moment she sat cross-legged on hischest.  It was like sitting on the mother of all water-beds.  "Standstill!"  Then she jumped down on the street and fixed him with her gaze.   "Do you remember the death of Aruman?"   "No.  Hm.  No-"   "Think back on that day.  Think hard."   "What day?"   "The day at Isengard, when Gandalf spoke with Aruman."   "I remember that day."  Pause.  "Sort of.  That's a funny look inyour eyes.  I haven't seen it since those distant days when you lovedme."   "There is something inside that mountain of butter that I still love.Now, if that means anything to you, remember the day at Isengard.  Thinkhard.  I have.  It pained me, and I suppose it will give you a splittingheadache as well-"   "I'll get a splitting headache, or just a split head, if I don't doas you-"   "No joking, Aragon!  Just do as I say!  Please!"   "Please?  From you?  Then this must be important indeed!"   "It is."   Aragon stood still.  He even ceased to wobble after a while.  Then heclasped Endurit.   "There is more," said Arwen.  "I have it from Pipsqueak."  Sheexplained.  Aragon drew Endurit.   "I'll trim down.  The lard from me by dieting and the lard from acertain wizard with Endurit!"   "Excellent.  But first things first.  I have a plan.  I must leaveyou for a while, east."   "I think we should simply cut Gandalf's head off.  But wait.  I needto trim down before I'm physically fit for it.  One reason why he wantsme to be fat, I think.  I bet it's his fault.  At any rate, he has manyweapons.  A direct assault on him may end in disaster."   "It is not Gandalf's fault that you are so fat, nor your own.  Hejust took advantage of it.  But pretend that you don't know thesethings.  Play along.  I have a plan for Gandalf too."  She laughed, andfor a moment her eyes shone with an oily green.   And so the plans of the forces of Good and the forces of Shady butBasically Decent (Plus Morrie) ripened.  Ariellë was contacted, and allknowledge shared with her.  With the upcoming peace-conference withSauron and Arwen hunting east for the Ring, the future looked bright.Even Morrie, who knew a powerful rival when he saw one, was on theanti-Gandalf team.  Also he realized now that it was probably not Arumanwho had supplied Lotho with the machine guns that theSackville-Bagginses had killed Norbert and Clovis with, but Gandalf.   Yet the plots and schemes of Mesprendeur Valóma the Crafty were notso easily defeated.  Many were his contacts in the East.  Many were theflokarinos that he sent secretly east as bribes.  Many were theblackmailing letters that went the same way.  He may have lost part ofhis power in the City, and more of it than he realized, yet he was notimpotent - save perhaps in the biological sense.  Two days later camethe message from Mordor that there would be no peace.  Whether Sauronhimself sent the message or someone else did without his knowledge andconsent this chapter does not tell, though a hint will be provided.  Inany event Ariellë's plan for a peace conference at the Gates of Mordorwas shattered.  The Armies of the West prepared for war.  Gandalf ledthe War Council.  It was very short:   "We shall march to the Black Gate.  There we shall hold Ariellë'speace conference.  We shall make peace, and we shall make it with ourblades!  Let Ariellë stay home and do her knitting!  King Aragon shalllead us."  Pipsqueak also had to go, by Gandalf's order.  Gandalf didnot know that Pipsqueak's reluctance was feigned: ere she left, Arwenhad told him that she had a plan for the disposal of the wizard, and hemust be present when it came to fruition.   Aragon, hearing Pipsqueak's voice, turned in surprise.  He recognizedit easily, but it was not as squeaky as it had been.   "Aragon, why is this chapter called 'The Back Orifice Opens'?"   Aragon patted his sword.  "We intend to hack our way through thegate."  Then he looked up, puzzled at the groans of the readers.   As the armies made ready to leave the City, Aragon tried to mountBabar the Mûmak.  But he could not.  The Mûmak knelt down, but withAragon on its shoulders it could not rise.  Nor could there be found orswiftly constructed a scaffolding that would support Aragon as hemounted the standing Mûmak.   "It was an ill wind that brought me this fate.  Long have I beentired of being this huge.  Well can I understand my Arwen when she saysthat if I don't lose a landslide of stone she will uproot a certaingrove of turnips."  The others looked at him strangely at this.  Then hesighed.  "I did ask the author of this chapter to do some voodoo to trimme down fast.  The dumb shite just mumbled something about having beenburned on drastic alterations in a previous chapter."  Then he drew hissword, with customary difficulty: "You shall not be sheathed again untilI can see my toes!"   "Until you are slim again to be able to," came the snicker fromMorrie.   "That too," replied Aragon.  "Be careful how you tease me, mobster.I can roll onto you.  I may be too soft to crush you, though my weightis easily mastodontic enough, but I may smother you."  He smiled.  Heknew that he was on the right path: even the day before, he had weighedmore than Babar.  Now he did not.  He reached out and down and pattedMorrie on the shoulder.  A little later the Armies of the West begantheir eastward march, Babar happily carrying no weight beyond his own.   The last that Pipsqueak saw of Morrie's face was eyes brimming withuncharacteristic tears.  This was some moments after Aragon had pattedhis shoulder.  The Mobster was clutching something beneath his tunic,though so innocuously that only the experienced eye of his youngercousin noticed.  Pipsqueak was absolutely befuddled.  He had never everseen his morose cousin weep before, out of courtrooms. He could guessnothing, no parting gift of any kind, that Aragon would have givenMorrie, let alone one that could have moved him in any way whatsoever.   Line after line they went, infantry of Gondor and cavalry ofRohan.  This early on the march the moods were high, and the banterbetween the two armies friendly.   "Hey, why are you wearing skirts, you women?"   "At least we're wearing something below the waistline.  Some of youstreakers don't!"   They made their first night-camp some distance past Disgiliath.  Somestragglers, eager to explore the decrepit old city of the Atlanteans,came in late and were caned.  Pipsqueak recognized the canes andshuddered.   "Hey", cried out Aragon in the evening murk.  "Where are those twobottles of Westfarthing Chinook I had?  I know I had them before we leftthe city!"  Pipsqueak wondered at this for a moment, trying to put twoand two together.  Then he smiled.  Four!  He was no longer befuddled.   It was near the end of the second day of their march from theCross-roads that they first met any offer of action.  For a smallorc-village had been spotted by the scouts a few miles upland of theRoad.  Gandalf at once gave his orders.  Six hundred men separated fromthe main body of the army and followed the wizard through the thickets,east and up.   "Hey, come here, lad!" he cried to Pipsqueak.  "Your training isn'tended yet!"  The hobbit reluctantly followed.  From a small plastic bagextracted from his extensive clothing Gandalf took a pinch of dust anddeftly inhaled it.  Pipsqueak recognized the bag and the dust.  Hestill has some of the Vala dust from Charadhras?  Or has the oldsnorter replenished it?  I wish I hadn't let the others find out aboutit when Morrie found it.   The going was swifter than might be expected in a landscape likethis: jungle, or almost so.  But the scouts knew their business.  Theyfound the swiftest way, winding round knolls, wading up creeks.  Twicethey detoured around patches of leafless forest and withered bushes ofsome kind.  "Agent Orange or something like it," Pipsqueak overheard asoldier explain to another.  "Against the coca fields.  We don't wantto pass through there!"  "Right.  Round and up."   After an hour and a half of careful march through the uplands ofEthelien they arrived at the village.  The orcs were going about theirbusiness, making ready for the night.   This is not what I expected, Pipsqueak thought.  These aremostly women and children.  I didn't know that orcs had women andchildren.  Where are their weapons?  I see one guy lugging around a bowand a quiver.  Why is that female caressing its imp?  From talk thathe overheard he realized that some of the Gondorian soldiers wereequally baffled.  Yet they surrounded the village quietly.  Many of themseemed to know their business well.  Pipsqueak grew more and moreuneasy.  "Lock and load," whispered Gandalf.  "What, our swords?" camehushed replies.   "CHAAARGE!" rang Gandalf's cry.  There was a great flapping noise inthe nearest trees; some leaves and feathers came drifting down.  TheGondorians poured their arrows into the village like a dark hail,then drew their swords and ran forward, converging.  Two of theGondorians fell with sudden shafts sticking from their chests.  Somemore fell to their own men's mis-aimed arrows.  But to the orcs it wasno use.  The three orc-men who had weapons soon looked like slicedhedgehogs.  Then the slaughter began in earnest.  When afterwardsPipsqueak followed the men back to the Road, not one orc remained alivebehind them.  But Gandalf's eyes were shining with an ecstatic light.   We shall mercifully pass the gruesome details by, save onehappenstance.  One scene burned itself into Pipsqueak's memory.  It wasa young orc-boy and an orc-girl, apparently in their late teens.  Theystood hand in hand, staring wide-eyed at the attackers.  They made noattempt to escape or defend themselves: it was no use, and they knew."Hey you!" cried Gandalf to one of the Gondorians.  "Grease thosetwo, you moron!"   "No... no..." mumbled the soldier.  Pipsqueak saw that he was weepingsoundlessly.  There was a broad smear of blood near the point of his longsword.  An orc-child lay some feet behind him, neck almost severed.  Thechild's dead hand was still clutching a small stone.   "Aah, spineless swine!" cried Gandalf.  He strode three long stepsand pushed the soldier violently to the ground.  Then he pointed hishand at the orc-pair.  Zap.  Zap.  The girl fell dead, then the boy,each with a smouldering hole in the chest: Pipsqueak was off fried baconfor months.  Gandalf started flinging his evil lightnings at theorc-children.  Zap Zap Zap.  "Get the goblin-imps too!" he cried in agreat voice, insane and happy.  "That race cannot be redeemed!  Arbeitmacht frei!  Nits make lice!"   As the party returned to the main body of the army, there were manyhowls of protest: not all the soldiers of Gondor and Rohan enjoyedthe sight of orc-heads on the tips of the spears of some of thereturning men.  Some of these heads had belonged to orc-children.   As Pipsqueak tried to fall asleep, he overheard the celebration ofthat minority of the Gondorian soldiers who had enjoyed their littleevening out. They were drinking heavily, and boasting.   I was at Srebrenica.  This was better.  We got them all this time.Gandy's not like that wimp Mladic.   Hey, I was at Tuol Sleng.  That was better.  We got thousands.  Hadtime to play, too.   Can't beat Auschwitz, you amateurs!   Heh heh, does what I did in Rwanda count?   Urg, we wuz too drunked up at Sand Creek.  Good thing I wuz soberthis time.   You aren't so sober now, are ye?   Heh heh heh.   Attaboy.   Heh heh heh heh.   ...Calley, you amateur...   ...Sabra, Shatila...   ...wading in gore...   ...what, can'tcha bend your knee?   ...heh heh heh heh...   ...Nanjing...   ...Belgian Congo...   ...more than threescore stubborn monks hewn down on the shore...   ...you are old, Viking...   ...ten captured Chinese soldiers each of us, to kill as wepleased...   ...Jerusalem...   The night that followed, and the night after that, were the blackestand most painful thus far in Pipsqueak's short life.  Theseconversations that he overheard did not improve matters.   The night after the massacre at the orc-village Pipsqueak had astrange dream.  He dreamt that he fell awake.  He could remember nodetails.  All that he remembered when he awoke from his dream was havingbeen awake, and that he hadn't enjoyed it.   Upon the sixth day from Minas Tirith they came at last to the endof the living lands.  Only parking lots and malls stretched before them,league upon ugly league.  At this horror some of the host were unmanned,already sick to the hearts with the massacre of the orc-village.   Aragon looked at them, and there was pity and understanding in hiseyes.  These were young men from Rohan, from Westfold far away, orhusbandmen from Lotstarch.  They were not made for the slaughter thatGandalf had led them into.  Nor was he, for that matter.  He quailed atthe thought of looking Arwen in the eyes.   "Go!" said Aragon.  "But keep what honour you may, and do not run!March instead quietly back to Minas Tirith, and prepare yourreports.  There will be investigations following this campaign."   "Hah!" cried Gandalf.  "Wimps!  No guts for a little bloodshed in anoble cause!  Good riddance to maggots!  Yaaah!"   Slowly the reduced army marched northwards towards the gate.  Orslowly may not be the proper word: Pipsqueak felt as if wading throughtreacle.  He could walk ten painful steps forwards and advance only afew inches.  The soldiers around him apparently experienced the same, bythe talk that he overheard.   The army made their last camp on the march, north and a little westof the Black Gate.  No enemies were to be seen, yet fear lay heavy onmost of the soldiers.  The treacle became thicker.   Suddenly Pipsqueak realized that he was no longer in the camp.  Hestood much closer to the Black Gate, together with Gandalf, Aragon,Giggly, Lego-lass, Eonard, Dr. Imrahil, Armadillo and a few others whomhe could not name because the lazy author of this chapter could not bebothered to look them up.  Without needing to be told, he knew that aparley was about to be held.  A man, richly dressed, appeared on thewall that arched above the gate.  Presenting his left side briefly tothe delegates of the West, he showed them his empty scabbard in token ofpeace.  The device of his shield was the text "Mouth of Tauron".  Thenhe spoke.  His voice was melodious.   "Well?  Why do you disturb us further?  Will you give us no peace bynight or day?"  Its tone was that of a kindly heart aggrieved byinjuries undeserved.   "But come now," the voice continued.  "Some of you at least we knowby name.  Gandalf we know too well to have much hope that he seekethcounsel here, nor forgiveness.  But thou, Aragon, lord of the Rangers ofthe North, art declared by thy well-worn travel clothes, and more by thenoble countenance of thy forefathers.  Though thy waistline surprisesus.  Why hast thou not come before, and as a friend?  Much have wedesired to see thee, especially now, to save thee from the unwise andevil counsels that beset thee!  Is it yet too late?  Despite theinjuries that have been done to our country - in which, alas! thou hasthad some part - still my lord would save thee, and hope to keep theefrom the ruin which draws closer.  Indeed he is among the few, thoughnot the only one, who has resorted from scheming and insults toinfluence thee."   Aragon opened his mouth as if to speak, but said nothing. He lookeddeep into the eyes of the Mouth standing above him, and then to Gandalfat his side; and he seemed to hesitate.  There was a silence.   It was Gandalf who broke it suddenly.  "The words of this messengerstand on their heads.  But in the language of Mordor, help means ruinand culture means glitz and clichès, that much is clear."   "Peace!" said the Mouth.  "I do not yet speak to thee, traitor toboth sides.  Pray allow me first to speak to the Ranger, whom my lordhas hopes for.   "What hast thou to say, Ranger of the North?  Wilt thou have peacewith my lord, and all the aid that his knowledge, founded in long years,can bring?  Shall we make our counsels together against evil days, andrepair our injuries with such good will as we may find?  Shall we havepeace, thou and we?  It is ours to command."   "I will have peace," Aragon answered at last, thickly and with aneffort.  All the Gondorians present cried out gladly, till Gandalflifted his hand.  "Yes, the King will have peace," he said, "he willhave peace, when you and your master and all your works have perished."Suddenly Aragon noticed a very large bottle of ink eraser in thewizard's hand, though only he realized its significance.  As theflabbergasted man on the wall above turned his gaze upon him, he onlylooked down and nodded mutely.   --- Pipsqueak's mind worked slowly and labouriously.  The treacleseemed to have reached his brain, impeding no longer only his physicalprogress.  He had a strong sense of deja vu, but he couldn't placeit ---   "You are a liar, Mouth of Sauron!" continued Gandalf.  "You speak ofpeace.  You hold out your hand to us, and I for one see only a finger onthe claw of Mordor.  Cold and cruel!  What will you say of your armiesbesieging Minas Tirith, and the incendiary bombs showering the city?When your master hangs from a gibbet for the sport of his own crows willGondor have peace with Mordor!"   The Mouth looked puzzled.  "Our armies besieging the City ofGondor?  We know of that attack, but apart from those renegadeNazdaq thou mayst be certain that Mordor had nothing to do with it.Tanks and automatic weapons were used in that attack, weren't they?Mordor has very few such weapons, and thou knowest this."   "Yeah, right.  And where did those armies come from then?" sneeredGandalf.   "Tell thou us," replied the Mouth.  "Yet we have our suspicions.  TheTurquoise Wizards that thou broughtest east, Attila and Pinafore, arestill active.  Running guns, among other things.  And we know that theNazdaq had dealings with them."   Aragon looked up.  Gandalf moved the bottle of eraser menacingly.   "Liar," he said simply.  "We will listen no more to your lies."   With that he calmly reached into his bag ---   --- Pipsqueak's sense of deja vu increased sharply ---   --- and produced a whip of many thongs.  Lashing them skywards, hecaught the Mouth of Sauron around the knees.  Then he pulled, and theMouth fell, crashing on the stone flags before his own master's gates.   As the gaudily dressed man died, Gandalf casually threw a smokegrenade at him.  The smoke covered him completely.  At the same time, agreat cry of rage rose behind the wall.  Then a breeze wafted the smoketowards the west.  The edge of the smoke cloud covered the delegation ofthe West briefly, and Pipsqueak distinctly felt a fresh and pleasantfragrance that he did not associate with Gandalf's smoke grenades.  Itcould have been the Mouth's perfume.  Then they had to retreat rapidlyfrom the gates, as the host of Mordor poured out to avenge the Mouth ofSauron and the indignity of murdering their envoy at a parley.   Blades flashed brightly in a bloody melee.  Shafts fell like fletchedsleet.  Pikes pumped like pistons, drawing water that was red.  Gandalfstrode foremost in the army of the West, lightning after lightninglashing out from his right hand.  Pipsqueak, who had often wondered atthis power of the wizard, looked closer.  He had rockets before.  Butwhat's a bloody Star Wars prop doing in this world?   In the front line of the army of the West now stood Pipsqueak, and hedidn't like it.  He was no coward, not now, but he saw men falling onboth sides, and to his mind came images of widows and orphans.  He mustput a stop to this madness.   He drew his trusty old flintlock pistol.  He did not know whence itsuddenly came; it was there, perfectly naturally.  He could not rememberusing it before, but he could remember that he had used it before.Pointing it skyward, he discharged it.  Bang!  There was no recoil,and very little gunsmoke, but he accepted this as perfectly natural.   "Stoooop!" he cried.  The nearest men glanced briefly at him.  Thatwas all.   Pipsqueak reached hurriedly for more powder, wadding and a new ball.Then: What am I doing?  If this is a dream, I have total control.  Ican do anything I want.  If I want to make it so that I have alreadyreloaded my flintlock, it will be loaded.  Without bothering to reloadthe old museum piece, he fixed its barrel between his ankles and drewthe hammer back with some difficulty.  Pointing it skyward again, hefired.  Bang!  "Stoooop!"   The nearest men glanced briefly at him.  He put the pistol back inhis belt, whence it disappeared without making its disappearancenoticed.  Perhaps a ruse would help.   "This is Mom talking to you!  You boys stop this ruckus this instant,or you'll be grounded for a year!  You're in serious trouble already,d'you hear?"   The men of the opposing armies did not hear.   An arrow, one of the thousands raining from both sides, came straighttowards Pipsqueak's face.  It parted the hair on his helmetless head ashe ducked, swiftly as the orc-chieftain in Moria in the original text.He gave up.  Let them fight, if they want to fight.  When does Arwen'splan turn up?   Then the storyline changed abruptly again.  Some of the readerspricked up their ears at that, before remembering that this is a writtentext; most shook their heads sighing.   The cry rang out in many voices: "Dragons are coming, dragons arecoming!"  The two armies stopped dead, both the living and those whowere already bleeding quietly on the tarmac.  The soldiers gaped up atthe sky, where dozens of huge shapes sped down towards them, mightyserpents with wings, black or brown contrails.  Only Gandalf remainedoblivious of them.  Zap, zap, zap went the blaster in his hand.Easterlings and Southrons continued to fall.  Then Pipsqueak saw twodragons whom he thought that he recognized.   Orm Embar and Yevaud!  Pipsqueak's mind was made up.  The slaughter must be stopped, and nowhe knew how to stop it.  He did not know what a flight of dragons ofEarthsea were doing in Muddle-earth, but he had an idea of how to makeuse of these two.  He had never thought that being a Le Guin fan wouldcome of use.   Were these Arwen's plan?  She had noticed him reading the Earthseabooks in Minas Tirith and had nodded approvingly.   He cried their Names.  His voice was little and the noise in the skywas grown great, but the dragons of Earthsea have keen ears.  They canhear the grass grow, and they can hear it on the next island on a stormyday, or so it is said.  With an air of surprised reluctance the pairarrested their rushing swoop towards the thousands of men on the ground.Pipsqueak cried to them again, remembering not to look into their oilygreen eyes.   "Orm Embar and Yevaud!  Rid me of that wizard, then of yourselves!"He pointed.  At once the two dragons turned their attention to Gandalf.These were not dragons of Muddle-earth, like Smaug and Ancalagon thatwere no more.  A dragon of Earthsea must obey one command from one whospeaks his true name; but the first part of this command was one thatpleased them.  Dragons of many western writers enjoy toying withflatlanders, these absurd and amusing little bipeds that cannot fly.  LeGuin's dragons of Earthsea are not among the exceptions.   Pipsqueak knew these things well.  "You too, Kalessin!  Noman-baiting today!"  Perhaps the dragons thought him more than a nervoushobbit with big front teeth.  In their experience it was mages who hadpowers such as being able to hover two inches above the ground.Kalessin did not seem to obey, though, merely hovering back andwatching: amused, perhaps.  Kalessin is always amused, I think, even inanger.  It must be nice.   It was then that Pipsqueak wondered how he was able to commanddragons who spoke (or bothered to speak) only the Old Speech ofEarthsea, when he spoke in Westron of Muddle-earth.  Author'sprerogative, perhaps.  There are inconsistencies enough in this dream.Now get back to the main action, Pipkin!   Zap, zap went the mad wizard's blaster.  Argh, argh went theEasterlings and the Southrons, one by one by one.  Then the wizard wentsquawk as Orm Embar grabbed him with the claws of his powerfulforelegs.  Although Gandalf was nearly six feet tall and after histussle with Forlong was grown nearly as wide across the waist, thedragon had no trouble tossing the terminally surprised ball of lard highinto the air.  The blaster separated from his hand and took its owntrajectory through the lower atmosphere of Muddle-earth, until it wasdestroyed in a blinding flash by a jet of pale blue flame fromKalessin's mouth.  There were shock diamonds in that jet, and the dragonsailed half his (or was it her?) own length up and backwards, trailingyellow smoke.  Gandalf reached the top of his arc.  His mouth grew roundand his eyes wide open, but he had stopped squawking.   Then Yevaud's mighty tail swung round, thicker near the middle than aman is tall yet faster than a whiplash.  Yellow smoke streamed thickfrom his nostrils.  Dragons of Earthsea may yield one mastery to one whospeaks their true names, but they will choose the manner so as to bestserve (or amuse) themselves.   &gt;CRACK&lt;   Pipsqueak saw that he had accomplished more than he had purposed.  Asone the dragons abandoned their play.  With the ancient yet vigorousKalessin in the lead they pursued instead the rapidly receding wizardtowards the flaming Mt. Viagra in the far distance.  A baseball cap, toPipsqueak like a large tent, landed on a broken patch of tarmac somedistance from him before dissolving back into nothingness.   The flight of the dragons, both the arrival and the departure, causedsome panic in both armies.  Aragon did not panic, but Babar did.  Risingon his hind legs, he trumpeted with fear, and Aragon fell to the ground.At that impact, the ground shook.  Shopping malls slid and fell, roofscaving in.  A great smoke rose.  Pipsqueak rejoiced at this sight.  Thecollapse of the two Towers of the Teeth, however, caused him a greatunease, though he did not know why.   Aragon got back on his feet.  Each of his footsteps was a smallaftershock.  "That was a bad fall, Pipsqueak," he said.  "Imagine howbad it would have been but a week or two ago."   The sun shone suddenly warm and brightly, though it had not beenovercast before.  Pipsqueak found himself knee-deep in a basin of warmand pleasant water.  It had apparently once been a fountain near thegardening section of an ancient shopping-mall that was still standing,though the last paying customer must have left through the now brokenautomatic sliding doors when Methusalah wore nappies, or earlier.Pipsqueak's trousers might be drenched, but he felt as if wearing onlybathing trunks, and he was: quite an unusual attire for hobbits.  Thismade him feel rather bashful before the eyes of so many, but otherwisehe was happier than he could remember ever having been.  There was ahush.  No sword was raised, though many were unsheathed; no shaft wasspeeding, though many were on the bowstrings.  At this point Pipsqueaknoticed that his pistol was gone.  It did not worry him.   The two armies stood panting.  Then a Southron king strode forward,tall and broad-shouldered.  He was coal black, dreadlocks inlaid withgold thread reaching almost to his waist.  His right arm was missing;only a scorched stump stood out from the shoulder.  He was bleeding frommany small cuts on the left side of his body.  He raised his remaininghand in a gesture of peace, and stopped a few paces before Aragon.  Hecast a swift glance at Pipsqueak and smiled a little.   Aragon was grown slimmer.  He sheathed his sword.  It needed nowiping first: there was no blood on it.   Then the Southron spoke.  "Now that that meddlesome menace Inkánushis gone, can we be friends, man?  Can we have a little peace again?"   The sun continued to shine without malice.
        "Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten us into,"muttered Sam, shielding his eyes with his hand as he gazed eastwardover the bleak horizon.  Their wanderings in the Emyn Mail had broughtthem to a steep cliff, far enough above the ground below to makejumping out of the question.        "But, Sammy," whimpered Frodo, beginning to sob and whine andcontort his face in a generally comical manner.  He doffed his bowlerand scratched his head, causing his curly hair to stand on end.  Samcrossed his arms and looked askance at Frodo, rolling his eyes for thebenefit of an imaginary audience.        But beneath his outward show of exasperation lay a tangle ofturbulent thoughts.  Now you've done it, Sam Gamgee, thought Sam tohimself while Frodo sobbed on.  Played your hand when the game'sbarely started, and how're you going to get him back to the Shire if hedon't trust you no more?  Gruffly he said to Frodo, "I'm goin' off tothink.  You stay put, hear?"  Through his sniffles Frodo nodded.        Sam walked back up into the hills, settling on a rock bearingthe carven inscription "El Rond was here"; from this seat he had a piss-poor view of anything of interest, but could keep a close eye on Frodowhile remaining out of earshot so that Sam could indulge in theobligatory introspective soliloquy which should have been Frodo's backat the end of Part One.        "Ah, Rosie," sighed Sam, unbuttoning his shirt and laying onecalloused working-class hand tenderly upon his tattooed chest.  "Ah,Rosie, have I gone and mucked up the Revolution before it's a-begun?It felt good, so good, to give it to him straight, but the feelingdon't last, and what's left?  He don't trust me no more, Rosie, andthat won't do, not at all.  If he don't trust me, all our plans are fornowt, nohow."        Sam gazed thoughtfully, surprisingly thoughtfully for a working-class hero, over the land before him, bleak and barren save for theoccasional neon-lit oasis.  "I know, Rosie.  I know, I've known allalong, what I ought to do."  His gaze settled on Frodo's forlornfigure, hunched at cliff's edge.  He's still bawling, the git.  Samgave a snort, then sobered again as the magnitude of his missionreasserted itself in his inner vision.        "Ahhh," he sighed.  "I know what I ought to do.  But I amafraid, Rosie.  Simply afraid.  And if I do it, go through with it, dothe deed that must be done, will you think me any less a Hobbit?"  Samrested his plump chin in his plump palm and pondered.        Then, unbidden, it was as if a veil parted, revealing aVision:  Rosie, riveting Rosie, bearing aloft the Standard ofRevolution!  Revolution!  And surrounding Rosie the masses, theWorkers, oppressed no more!  And from the crowd arose the chant:  Forthe Shire!  For the Shire!  And suddenly Sam knew what he had to do,and how trivial were his petty parochial concerns about his Hobbithood,compared to the Great and Glorious Cause of Liberating the Shire.        "For the Shire!" exclaimed Sam, leaping to his feet, and verynearly ran right down the hill and took Frodo then and there, butfortunately the Great Vision vanished and Sam came to his senses,realizing that he still had a hell of a lot of explaining and bridge-mending to do first.  So he crept down quietly, on his quiet Hobbitfeet, to return, as a good servant, to his (gag - choke - barf)Master's side.        And damned if the silly git wasn't still crying and whining.        "I feared it was so.  I feared it was so," whimpered Frodobetween gut-wrenching sobs.        "Here, come now, Mr. Frodo," murmured Sam in his mostsoothingly subordinate tone.  "It's not so bad as all that."        Frodo gulped and looked up, blinking in bewilderment atSam.  "S-Sam?" he hiccupped.  "Your-your accent--?"        "Oh, that," laughed Sam with a good-natured and not-at-all-threatening working-class laugh.  "D'ya like it?  Learned it at aworkshop for the Shire Thespians Local 286."        "Why, Sam," said Frodo, astonished.  "I had no idea you were aThespian--not that there's anything wrong with that."        "Oh, there's lots of things you don't know about me, and that'sa fact," replied Sam cheerfully.  "But we'll have plenty of time to getto know each other a lot better on this journey--least I hope so."        Now Frodo was utterly amazed, all tears forgotten.  "Thenyou're not angry with me any more?  But what about all of that, back bythe river?"        "Oh, you know me and boats, Mr. Frodo," Sam joviallyresponded.  "My therapist told me my PTSD was under control, but lookslike I've still got me some issues to work through when I get backhome, don't it?"        Frodo laughed.  "Well, all right, Sam.  I haven't the leastidea what this 'PTSD' is, but from what I saw of it I hope it isn'tcatching.  Not something I should wish to contract."  He shuddered.        "Well, come along, then," Sam said, giving Frodo a heartyheterosexual clap on the shoulder.  "Let's find a way out of thesehills.  But how's this, sir?  We'll use our nimble Hobbit feet andclever Hobbit hands to climb our way down."        "All right, Sam," agreed Frodo.  "You first, then."        "Oh, no, sir, I couldn't think of it.  You're the master, sir,and I wouldn't be robbing you of your place of primacy."        Frodo raised his eyebrows, then nodded.  "Very good, Sam.  I'lllead the way."  Frodo lay flat upon the ground.  Just as he had loweredhimself over the edge and begun to creep cautiously along the cliff'sface, Frodo heard a terrifying shriek.  Instinctively he looked up, andhis blood ran cold:  A giant red-and-black LED banner scrolled acrossthe sky, proclaiming over and over:                 NAZDAQ DE-LIST SHARKEY ENTERPRISES.        "Ahhh!" cried Frodo, losing his grip; and all would have beengrim for him, indeed, had not Sam swiftly reached down with his cleverHobbit hands and grasped Frodo, hauling him back up to safety.        "There, there, now," soothed Sam, comforting Frodo with hisarms and body.  "All's well as ends well, as my Gaffer would say."        "Oh, Saaaam!" wailed Frodo, sobbing bitterly into Sam'schest.  "Better  if you had let me fall."        "Don't be saying that, Mr. Frodo.  You don't mean that, andthat's a fact."        "I do mean it, and that's a fact," cried Frodo.  "I amcursed, Sam, cursed in every way.  Unlucky in life, unlucky in love--"        "Here, now, you've had a few setbacks in the market, is all,"Sam consoled him.  "As for love, why, we'll find a way out of here andback to Rivendell, and that's a fact."        But Frodo remained inconsolable; indeed, at Sam's words he greweven more gloomy, and fell strangely silent.  Sam tipped his head tolook at Frodo with concern.  "Mr. Frodo?" he said uncertainly.  Frodosaid nothing, gazing morosely past Sam's chest at the desolate,cheerless land in which they had been stranded.  Speaking in his mostingratiatingly obsequious manner, which never failed to lift Frodo'sspirits, Sam repeated, "Mr. Frodo, sir, just think of all the lovelylasses thinking fondly of you back at..."  but his voice faded asFrodo's countenance grew all the more despondent.  Then Sam understood.        "You faked it?"        Glumly Frodo nodded.        "But, but the Lady Arwen, sir," said Sam, confused.  "Youweren't faking when you saw her, and that's a fact.  I saw it with myown eyes, I did, and that's--"        "The Lady Arwen was dressed all in leather and armor, andwielding mighty weaponry, Sam," Frodo miserably interrupted.  "Had shebeen decorated in the traditional accoutrements of stereotypicalfemininity, sitting sweetly at home sewing flags while the menfolk didall the deeds of valor in the world, I should not have felt so much asa twitch."        "Oh."  Sam frowned, pondering this new twist.        "I am doomed, Sam, doomed to wander without a place in anoppressive and heterocentric world, and it would be better for you notto be burdened with me."        "Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard," protested Sam.  Suddenly hegasped and drew back, staring at Frodo.  "Mr. Frodo, that's hard," herepeated wonderingly.  "Why, I never did feel no noodle like that, andthat's a fact!  A pity we haven't a lass at hand.  Perhaps we mightchance upon one, yet, if we ever--"        But sadly, ruefully, Frodo shook his head.  "Sam, dear Sam," hesaid, his voice laden with an existential anguish far beyond hisyears.  "Don't you understand?  I don't WANT a lass."        Now Sam was thoroughly confused.  "You don't...?"  But then,suddenly, it seemed to him that Frodo's face shone softly as if litfrom within, and all was illuminated for Sam:  He loves me.  He's likethat, and sometimes it shines through, somehow.  But he loves me,whether or no.        Then Sam realized that the illumination was coming from alantern hovering above his own head.  "All right, I take your meaning,"Sam said to the lantern, and it obligingly disappeared.  This isturning out better than I dared hope, thought Sam.  He looked back toFrodo, who was now gazing disconsolately over the barrenlandscape.  "Mr. Frodo, sir?"        Frodo turned doleful eyes upon Sam.  "Yes, Sam?"        "Are--are you wearing your Ring, sir?"        At this Frodo suddenly laughed.  "Dear, simple Sam!  Do Ilook like I'm wearing my Ring, you working-class ass?"        Sam blushed, and let his gaze drop before Frodo could see thesmoldering fires of revolutionary rage glowing therein.  "Well, no,sir, no you don't, Mr. Frodo, sir.  It's just that--"  Steelinghimself, Sam thought, For the Shire! and looked squarely atFrodo.  "It's just that I suddenly find myself wanting to kiss you,and, well, I thought maybe--"        Frodo's mouth fell open in surprise, then spread into a broad,delighted smile.  "Well, then," he said coyly, "kiss me, Sam."        Sam leaned closer to Frodo, then pulled back.  "Are you sureit's proper, sir?"        "What?  Two men together, you mean?"        "No, sir.  I mean, is it proper for a mere servant-boy to be sofamiliar with one of his betters."        "Oh, Sam," sighed Frodo, wrapping his arms around Sam, "you dosay the cutest things."        And so began the greatest Romance in all the History of Middle-earth.  The full Tale, all told, would require a dozen Volumes towholly tell; suffice it here to say that the world had never beforeseen a Romance so Epic, so Magnificent, so Moving and Tender, so Star-crossed and Riddled with Controversy, nor shall the world ever againknow its Like.  Long after all other Romances have been recycled intoshipping cartons, long after those who would have shelved this storydeep in the Oxford Closet have been likewise recycled, the Romance ofFrodo and Sam will live on, in time and in memory.        Many days wandered Frodo and Sam, ostensibly in search of a wayout of the Emyn Mail, but they weren't exactly hurrying about it, tosay the least.        "Mr. Frodo?"        Frodo looked up from Sam's fingers, which, like his own, werenow perpetually saturated and as wrinkled as prunes.  "Frodo."        "What's that, sir?"        "I think, Sam, dearest, given the degree of affection which weare now showing to one another, that you no longer need address me asyour master--unless that turns you on?"        "No," Sam answered decisively.  "No, sir, it doesn't."        "And drop the 'sir.'"        "Yes, sir."        "Sam--"        Sam gave Frodo his most winsomely proletarian smile.  "Yes,Frodo."        "Hmmm."  Frodo rolled onto his back and smiled dreamily at theclouds.  "How about, 'Yes, Frodo, my most beloved and only love of myheart and body.'"        Sam rolled his eyes and cast a surreptitious glance, laden withdark and revolutionary portents, toward the oblivious and love-besottedFrodo before reassuming the mask of cheerful and subordinatestupidity.  "How about we shorten that to 'Frodo, love,' and waste lesstime talking, if you take my meaning."        Frodo beamed at Sam.  "I take your meaning, Sam, love--and youreverything else," he crooned.  Sam affected a tender countenance andtook Frodo yet again into his arms.  Think of the Shire, he toldhimself, and distracted himself from the duty at hand by filling hismind with patriotic thoughts of Rosie the Red and the awaitingRevolution.        "Sam, love."        "Yes, Frodo, love?"        Frodo drummed his fingertips lightly upon Sam's very masculinechest.  "What's this about, then?"        "What's--ooooooh, thaaaaat."        "Yeeeessss.  Thaaaaaaat."        Aw, shit, think fast, think fast, Sam.  "Well.  Uh.  Why,it's--it's a Tradition, sir--love, Frodo, love--in the Gardener'sGuild."        "The Gardener's Guild."  One eyebrow rose.        "Why, yes.  Frodo.  Y'see, upon being received into the Guild,it's custom for each member to get a tattoo of his most fav'ritestflower upon his chest.  And, well, I, as you can see, I like, ah,roses.  Beautiful flowers, sir--love.  Beautiful."        To Sam's great relief Frodo accepted the explanation.  "Well,Sam, I must say I had no idea we had so many Guilds and Locals and suchin our very own Shire.  You know how I disapprove of Organized Labor."        "Oh, yes, that I do," answered Sam, pouring a load of subtextinto every word.  But Frodo's attention had returned to the tattoo.        "Hmm."  With one finger Frodo slowly outlined the word "Rose"beneath the flower.  "It shouldn't be at all difficult to change thisto read 'Frodo.'  Then," he smiled winsomely at Sam, "I'll always benear your heart."        Mustering a performance worthy of an Odogar (the ShireThespians Union's most prestigious award), Sam crooned, "You alreadyare, Frodo, love," and braced himself for another round of sweetnothings.        "Frodo, love."        "Yes, Sam, love."        "Don't take me wrong, now, but as delightful as these days havebeen, I'm thinking we'd better get to Mordor and get the job done, soyou have a proper estate, again."        "Oh."  Frodo considered, then nodded.  "You're right, Sam,love.  Now that I have you, I've no further use for that silly Ring."He raised himself from the ground, stood straight, and clasped hishands together, rubbing them briskly.  "Well!  How shall we ever findour way out of these hills?"  Frodo's eyes darted about this way andthat and he set his jaw, looking very grim and intent with the urgencyof his Quest.        "Well, Frodo, love," ventured Sam.  "I'm thinking we might takethat path, there."  Sam pointed to a wide, gently graded blacktop paththat descended toward the plains.        "Well!" said Frodo, pleased.  "I think I will trust to yourjudgment, Sam, love.  The path it is."  They gathered their supplies,strapped their packs onto their packs, and began the long but notterribly taxing descent to the plains below, stopping at a log cabinabout midpoint to refresh themselves and pick up a few maps andbrochures.        "The Dread Marshes," read Frodo from one such pamphlet as heand Sam walked along hand in hand.  "Oh, Sam, love, it soundsfascinating!  Is it on our way?"        Sam took a look.  "Seems to be," he said.  "I guess we can havea look about, see the sights.  But damned if I didn't forget to bringmy camera!  If my Gaffer could see me now, he'd be saying, 'Sam, youninnyhammer, didn't I tell you to always bring a camera wherever yougo, because sure as you don't, that'll be when you'll be wanting one.'"        "Well, Sam, love, there's no use calling yourself all the hardnames your abusive father berated you with," soothed Frodo.  "Besides,I bought a camera at the rest stop while you were busy admiring theflush toilets."        "Did you?"  Sam brightened.  "Good.  Good.  That'll come inhandy," he added under his breath, smiling to himself.  "Yes, indeed,it will."        They sauntered on down the path.  Sam cast a wistful glanceback over his shoulder, suddenly finding himself wishing he hadn't beenso quick to leave the Emyn Mail.        "There was LOVE!  All AROUND!  But I never HEARD it singing!No, I never heard it at all, till there was YOU!"        Sam looked over at Frodo with mild annoyance, but not withoutaffection:  and it struck him that despite his lofty intentions ofsocially redeeming revolutionary value he had gone and gratuitouslyfallen in love with Frodo.  Well if that don't throw a spanner in theworks.        "And there was MUSIC!  And there were won-der-ful ROSES!"        Rose.  Ah, she wouldn't be none too happy with him, shewouldn't, and he didn't think she'd go for settling down as a happylittle threesome.  But it was a long way back to the Shire; Samshrugged and put Rose out of his mind, determined to enjoy the momentwhile it lasted.        "Till there was YOOOOUUU!!!"        Easier said than done.  "Ah, Frodo, love, it might not be agood idea to be singing at the top of your lungs in a strange country.You never know what sort of riff-raff it might attract."        Just then a small, pale, androgynous creature stepped out frombehind a boulder.  "Hobbitses," it hissed lasciviously.  "Hobbit-MENNNS.  We likes, my Preciousss, we doesss."        "Exhibit A," muttered Sam.        The creature paid him no heed.  "Tricksy, tricksy Elf-wimmins,"it rambled on.  "Tricksy Elveses.  Tricksy Belden.  No mystery here, myPrecious.  Tricksy!  Promises us a feast of mens and then kicks uswhere it hurtses, nasty, nasty Elveses, never trust, never trust.  Butwe don't need Elveses now, my Precious, now we has Hobbit-mens all toourselves.  Oh, yes, we doesss--"        "Oh, no, we doesn't," snapped Sam, tightening his grip onFrodo's hand as he attempted to push his way past the creature.        But Frodo halted.  "Sam, wait.  I do believe he's that Guliblechap--"        "I'm not a he!" shrieked the creature.  "I'm a she!"        "What?" exclaimed Frodo and Sam in unison.        "I'm a she," repeated Gulible.        "But I'm told you're a he," argued Sam.        "And I'm told he's a virgin," countered Gulible, jabbing ascrawny thumb towards Frodo.  "But that's not what I sees, oh, no, myPreciouss, not at all--"        "And just how long have you been spying on us?" demanded Sam,blushing a fierce shade of red.        "Well, he may be a she," Frodo quickly interjected, tugging atSam's arm.  "What I'm told is never for certain."        "Well, whatever it is," grunted Sam, eyeing Gulible withsuspicion, "the sooner we're away from it, the better."        "No, no!" cried Gulible.  "Nice Hobbitses!  Cute Hobbitses!Sweet, sexy Hobbitses!  Nice Hobbit-mens take Spiegel with you!"        "Spiegel?" exclaimed Frodo and Sam, exchanging looks ofbewilderment.        "Spiegel is me, and me is Spiegel," declared thecreature.  "Spiegel, called Gulible because I once believed mens canchange.  Silly, silly Spiegel!  Bad, wicked, naughty mens, writingstorieses to please only themselves, storieses of buxom benippledwenches and frat-boy lusts, but nothing, nothing for poor Spiegel!  Nolusting after mens, oh, no, not allowed, not allowed!  But theRevolution is coming, my Precious, yes it is, when the Sisterhood shallbe powerful and the wimmins shall be gratified, and the mens shall notstop us, not the Hobbit-mens nor the Men-mens shall stop us now, and weshall overcome, we shall overcome, we shall overcome someday!  Now, nowSpiegel knows, yesss, my Preciouss, she does, she knows mens are goodfor only one thing, and when she gets the Precious back for her veryown, the Hobbit-mens and the Men-mens will give her all she wants, oh,yes, they will.  Oh, Precioussss!  The Blessed Precioussss!  Oh, theBlessed Precioussssss!!!"        "What an eccentric performance," muttered Frodo.  "Still, sheseems to be mostly harmless."  Interrupting Spiegel's catalog ofgrievances, he said aloud:  "All right, Spiegel, you may come alongwith us--but no more watching Sam and I when we're together."        "Oh, no, of course not, no watching," said Spiegel, not veryconvincingly.        "Swear it," growled Sam, flicking a switchblade.        "Spiegel swears it!  Spiegel swears it!  Spiegel be very good."        Frodo nodded, satisfied.  "Well, that's that.  Come along, Sam,love, and you, Spiegel."        Spiegel trotted along agreeably after Frodo and Sam.  Sam putthe knife away, but briefly pulled Spiegel aside to mutter sottovoce, "If you're really good, maybe I'll let you take somepictures."  Spiegel looked up at him with a libidinous gleam in hereye.  "Oh, for that, Spiegel be very good, indeed," she hissed, andin the meeting of their eyes was the meeting of two revolutionary andsubversive minds.
   Spiegel moved languidly, with her bust thrust forward so hard thatFrodo thought that surely her upper back must ache like sonofabitch,which it did.  Sam was in a fix: hand in Frodo's hand, Frodo's thumbcaressing; eyes on Spiegel's bosom; and mind ferociously on Rosie, RedRosie, Revolutionary Rosie.  Rosie with the athame and hands as swift asher temper.   Spiegel glanced at Sam and felt satisfied.  She started down the pathtowards the marshes, her small yet shapely bottom drawing Sam's eyeslike Playboy magazine draws adolescent boys and televangelists.  Thecat-calls from two passing joggers on their way towards the fast-foodjoint below proved that it wasn't just Sam: Spiegel was not as abhorrentas she thought herself.   Two hours later they were gorging cheeseburgers and french fries.Spiegel would at first take only a few fries and a bit of salad from oneof Sam's burgers.  "Gulible, you really should eat some more," saidFrodo.  "You look starved."  Looking guiltily at Frodo, the stick-thinhobbit-girl replied in song:         The greasy food         upsets my mood            it swells my bod.         I'm grossly big         I look a pig            I feel a clod.         I always feel ---   "Ha! ha!  What does we feel?" she said, looking furtively at the twomen.  "We'll tell you," she whispered.  "He told me years ago, Bagginstold me when I was just a little girl."  A shudder shook her body, andSam catching the look in her eyes felt a sudden sympathy welling in him.         Terribly fat;         Nose like a hat;         Always starving, ever growing;         Look like needing tugboat towing;         Never noticed till he said:         Boys would always want me dead!         Menfolk laugh behind my back         'Cause I waddle like a sack!         That's what Bilbo Baggins told         When I was just ten years old ---   Suddenly Sam understood poor Spiegel's troubles.  A self-starver, ananorexic little girl.  How beautiful and popular could she have been!Even in her emaciated state she was attractive.  With her green eyes andhair that when washed and tended would be a shock of flaming red, sheshould be the proverbial man-killer.   That was the deciding moment for Sam as far as old Bilbo Baggins wasconcerned: with just a few comments to an impressionable little girl,just to while away some tedious afternoons probably, this rich bastardhad shattered this poor working-class (Sam's assumption) girl'sself-confidence... oooh, Sam couldn't wait for the revolution.   Frodo felt a little of the same.  He didn't notice that she was (to astraight man) beautiful, but he felt her shame and knew how unneeded itwas.  He looked at Sam.  "Don't look at me," he whispered.  "I know aswell as you that Bilbo should not have said such things."   Loudly he said to Spiegel: "Look, old Bilbo is my uncle.  I know himbetter than you do.  He is full of bovine refuse.  You should have heardthose language lessons I took from him... you are not fat!"   "Yes, we isss!"   "No, you issn't!  Here, have a hamburger!"  He handed her aquarter-pounder with extra cheese.  Doubtfully she took it, and nibbleda single crumb.   "Ack ack phbttt!  Trying to poison poor Gulible they are, dumbmenfolk!  Grease and fat, Spiegel cannot eat that!"   "Come on," said Sam.  "Try it.  Give it a chance.  Frodo is right:you are thin as a twig.  Ten of those would do you good - ten each dayfor a month.  We aren't teasing you!"   "Yes you isss!  Baggins said we iss fat as a hippo in a butterfactory."   "And another Baggins says otherwise," Frodo replied.  "Why believe inhim and not me?"   "Becaussse he isss straight!"  The look in Spiegel's beautiful eyeswas venomous.   Frodo shrugged, not noticing Sam opening his mouth and shutting itagain.  "Have it your way then, fatso," he said.   This being the last restaurant for several days, the hobbits boughtseveral packs of vacuum-packed hamburgers in a nearby supermarket.  Thenthey started towards the marshes.  At first they followed a touristtrail, but this soon veered aside, and they left it.  They were in themarshes proper.   "I have been here before," said Spiegel.  "Hobbit-mens should becareful.  There are alligators here.  They don't touch me, because I'mtoo fat: I bet their cholesterol count soars at the sight of us."   "No, they won't eat you because gators eat meat and not sticks andwire with blobs of fat on them," replied Frodo, without noticing thehurt look that this produced in Spiegel.  Sam noticed, and his hateagainst the upper classes increased another notch.   Some time later, when Frodo was passing hraka behind a bush, Samtried again to explain to Spiegel that she was not fat.  "Have you heardabout anorexia?" he asked.   "Yes.  What's that got to do with us?  Only thin people who thinkthat they are fat have it!"   "Have you looked in a mirror?"   "No!  We hates mirrors!"   "You cannot honestly think that you are fatter than me and Frodo!"   "Yes we are!  Look!"  She grabbed a fold of skin between two fingers."Look like the Michelin man, we does!  Like a stack of car tyres.  Trucktyres!"   "There is no fat inside that fold," said Sam.  Spiegel turned awayand would not answer.   "Spiegel, why do you always refer to yourself as 'we'?"   "Because we are so fat that if ever we went by plane, we would haveto buy two or three tickets.  And boy would we be in trouble if theywere not adjacent!  Baggins said so."   "How would that old coot know?  He's so rowdy once he's had a drinkor two that every airline has him on a file - they refuse him wheneverhe tries to buy a ticket.  They've had enough of him!"   At nightfall they made camp.  Frodo took out the gas burner andinexpertly lit it.  Then he put a grille inside a thick-walled pot andput three hamburgers on it.  Soon a somewhat delicious smell spread.For a while Sam tried to convince Spiegel that she was not fat, whensuddenly she relented.  With a look of terrible revulsion on her face,she wolfed down a hamburger, and then two pounds of lettuce.  Samwhispered to her: "And please don't sneak off and throw that up!"  Aftera moment of thought he added: "You won't be a good girl if you do."Spiegel, the eyes of her mind upon Frodo's camera, sighed and curled upto sleep.   Some hours later she woke up, finding the camera placed next to her.The other two were gone, but from behind some densely leaved bushes camea quiet, rythmic rustling.  Heart pounding, she grabbed the camera andsneaked over to the bushes.  Quietly she peered over them, then put thecamera to her eye.   And then lowered it with a sigh.  Midnight and a low half moon arenot the perfect lighting for photographing without a flashlight, andthat was not an option.   The next morning Sam asked her if she had got a few good snaps thatmight be used for some revolutionarily useful extortion.  She returned abrief explanation.  Sam thought for a moment.   "Hey, Frodo.  I think we should stop travelling during the day.Spiegel says there are evil things about.  Evil things with eyes, andthey report to Minas Tirith.  It will go ill with your Núrnenshirehovel, er, estate if they get their hands on that deed."  Frodo, bynow trusting Sam totally, made no objections.   Sometime later that day, Spiegel got some interesting snaps amongthose bushes.   That evening Sam lit the gasfire.   "Won't those Minas Tirith-spies see that gaslight?" asked Frodo.   "No," replied Spiegel.  "For one thing, it is difficult to see thatlittle flame in broad daylight.  For another, marsh-lights can often beseen around here."   Frodo looked at Sam, who nodded.  A little later, Sam convincedSpiegel to have another hamburger, with extra cheese.  They were out ofgreen stuff, but she ate tomato slices instead.  Two pounds of them.  Atnightfall they packed their things and got started.   "What did you do that for?!"  Sam's voice was angry.  "Had a changeof preferences?  Suddenly like women again now?"   Frodo chuckled.  "Not in a lifetime.  Just wanted to see that lardwobble."   "Spiegel, don't pay that rich slavemaster no attention!  Just likehis father Bilbo, he is.  It's just one of them simian alpha-malepower-displays that that family is so fond of.  They'll be up againstthe wall the both of them one of these days, and you can be in thefiring squad!"  The girl, sobbing quietly, threw him a glance but saidnothing.   The night was dark, but not altogether so.  Civilization was farbehind them, and they were in a trackless land.  But miles and milesaway the lights of civilization were strong enough to illuminate thetops of the reeds even here: billboards, headlights, roving searchlightsreflected off the clouds.  As they walked deeper into the marshes,further from these lightsources, the night became darker.  Then the skyturned pale in the east, and the mountain fences of Mordor glitteringwith pinpoint lights showed faintly against it.  They made camp next toa wide mere.  Now they were deep into the marshes.  The ground was wet.The rustling reeds were tall, but there were no bushes.  To Sam'srelief, Frodo judged that they could have no privacy from Spiegel here."The reeds would rustle too much," he whispered coyly.  "They would swaylike clusters of flagpoles in a gale.  They would..."  Sam closed hisears to the rest.   Twice that day they cooked hamburgers.  During their first meal, Samcoaxed Spiegel into having an entire quarter-pounder.  "She alreadylooks healthier," whispered Frodo to Sam.  "Yes, really swelling," headded more loudly.  Spiegel maintained a stony look.  At their secondmeal they had to go without any vegetable stuff - she had eaten theironions, a whole pound of them, and her breath was not very nice for awhile.  More than once that day she had had the screaming hrakas.   Sam failed to convince her to have a second burger in lieu of thevegetables that she had followed up her previous three burgers with.  Atnightfall they set out.   Suddenly they stopped and shrank.  It was foggy.  Out of the air cametwo distant voices.   "...but honey..."   "You are not killing that fine man, hear?  Such a handsome, fine,strong, noble, handsome man!  I saw him in the trailer.  I think it washim anyway."   "But I did kill him!"   "He was not last seen dead!"   "But my plotline demands that he be dead!  It's my story after all!"   "And this is my skillet!"  &lt;clong&gt;   "Ow!  You silly old crone..." &lt;boing BOINK&gt;   "Say it!  Say he'll return to the story!" &lt;clang&gt;   "Okay, okay, hon..."   "Letting that fine man die and the miserable creature that stabbedhim live..."   The two voices trailed off.  Frodo shivered.  "What was that?  I feela strange and uncanny foreboding."  The other two shrugged.  Then thetrio continued onwards through the marshes.   "Aaah!!"  Frodo's panicky shriek rang through the night.  The othertwo turned like tops to face him.  "There is a dead man!  A dead man inthe water!  With weeds in his hair!"  He was staring into a wide poolwith several marshlights shining near the bank where he was standing.   "That's strange," replied Spiegel, approaching him with apprehension.   Sam cast a look at the dimly lit figure.  "It's the corpse of a manalright.  C'mon.  He's nothing to do with us.  Why haven't thealligators got him?"   "It looks like..." Frodo muttered to himself, unable to extricatehimself from the sight.  He bent down closer to the corpse.   With a splash a strong arm shot out of the water.  Before anyonecould react, Frodo was grabbed by the tunic, dragged into the water, anda shadow rose up out of it and pinned the wildly thrashing hobbit to themuddy bottom.  A mad fierce gleam was in his eyes.  The marshlightsshone like Griswold Christmas lights.  It was the man in the water, andhe was alive!   "Boromir!  Boromir!" cried Sam.  "You're alive!  But I sawhim kill you!"   Boromir did not reply, until Sam reached out from the bank andgrabbed him by the shoulder.  Then he pushed Sam back with one hand,still holding Frodo down with the other.   "Yes!" he cried.  "That he tried!  First he will take the Ring to theenemy who would devour us all, land and slaves being his promisedwages, and then he tries to kill me!  And then the others lash me to araft and send me down the Rauros falls!"   Frodo's struggling grew weaker.  A burst of bubbles came from hismouth.  Then Boromir drew his sword and pierced the drowning hobbitthrough the chest, to the hilt.   At dawn they stood on the bank of the little lake in the middle ofthe marshes, not watching the feast of the alligators.  On the groundlay pieces of wet confetti.  "Lies," said Boromir,  no longer, as hecast down the last bits of paper.  They looked like chads.  "Lies ofTyrannosauron and of El Rond.  And this," he fingered the Ring, "goesstraight into the fire.  To Mount Viagra!  It is an instrument ofoppression.  Are you with me, Sam, revolutionary Sam?"  Pointing at thered froth of the alligators: "Is something like this not what youdreamed of all the time?  I noticed the razor blade in his eggs!"   "You...you're the son of the Steward," said Sam.  "Yes, I can't saythat I disapprove.  Except for the signs at the tourist trails about notfeeding the litigators.  But you?"   Boromir sighed.  "I was always secretly uneasy about thecorporate-feudal oppression that my family inflicts on the people.  Thenthat little brat put his sword in me.  I had drawn sword against him afew moments before, I must admit..."   "I noticed."   "Oh did you?  Well, that opened my stomach.  But what really openedmy eyes was what happened after.  Bleeding like a pig I fought againstorcs, and they could not stand against me.  They clove my horn, but theycouldn't touch me!  The survivours ran off, and I believe Lego-lass andGiggly had their share of them.  If orcs it was: there was a strangemetallic gleam on them that was not armour.  They didn't bleed much whenI made great gashes in them with my sword, and what little blood camewas black.  Orc blood is as red as ours... but I fell exhausted with thewound that Frodo had given me.  And then... and then..."  Greater ragegleamed in his eyes.  "Aragon pretended that I was dead.  He questionedme, and when Giggly and Lego-lass came, he lied and said that I wasdead.  The other two believed him, even though I spoke and protested!They knocked me cold, and when I woke up I was tied to a raft anddrifting off the Rauros.   "How I survived I cannot explain.  The fall into the churning bowlbroke the raft into nearly sawdust, and I was free.  I was unable toswim, but grabbed a larger piece of wood and drifted down the river,until I was washed up on the east bank.  That Aragon is so wimpy at thesight of blood that he had closed my stomach-wound crudely with somerings from the chain-mail of an orc (or whatever it was), and that savedmy life then.  Otherwise my intestines would be trailing the length ofthe river by now ---   "I lay on the riverbank.  Happily the sword-thrust had gone in at thediaphragm, and missed the gullet and lungs and heart and intestines andthat.  That Frodo was tall for a hobbit, and I had been bending forward.It was the dirt on the blade that nearly finished me off, not so muchthe wound itself.  An old woman found me and carried me into a hut.  Shesaved my life.  She didn't speak.  She kept a large and battered skilletin her hand most of the time... Then when I woke up and knew that I wasgoing to live, the hut, the bed and the woman were gone.  I lay onfronds near the river.  I was dizzy with fever, even when I becamestronger, and I staggered blindly for days, until I stumbled into thatpool there.  I nearly drowned.  I put my head on a submerged tussock sothat my nose just stuck out of the water.   "Then I look up, and guess who is looking down at me!  And the restyou saw with your own eyes.  Who is she?"   "This," said Sam indignantly, "is Spiegel, nicknamed Gulible.  Shewas convinced by Bilbo Baggins when she was little that she was fatand ugly.  She's been an anorexic ever since."  Spiegel looked atBoromir with shy yet gleaming eyes.  "And that Frodo didn't help mucheither!"  Boromir looked at her with sudden sympathy.   "Ugly?  You're not ugly!"   "Yess..."  There was a hesitant note in the thin girl's voice.   "Come on, girl.  I'm partial to men myself, and shall not deny it;but I know when a woman is pretty and when she is ugly.  And you arepretty."   The light dimmed in Spiegel's green eyes, but was not altogetherextinguished.   "Frodo was gay himself," said Sam, grabbing Frodo's camera andtearing out the film.  There was no need for it anymore.   "Was he now?" replied Boromir.  "Well, an asshole is an asshole, nomatter his taste in holes!"   Two days later they emerged from the marshes.  They were out ofhamburgers, for Boromir was a large man, recovering from a wound and anillness, and Spiegel was eating much too, ballooning out towards anormal size.  This was land that was largely controlled by Sauron (whomthey wanted to avoid), but Gondor's agents walked among theMordorian neon glitz, disguised as tourists.  They were now the enemiesof the eldest son of the Steward, and would remain so even if Aragontoppled Boromir's father from power.  Accordingly Sam and Boromir didn'tdare show themselves, but sent Spiegel to do some shopping.  Bynightfall they had a cold meal in a little dell.  The ground was coveredin more than a foot of garbage thrown by careless tourists.  After themeal they started walking towards the Gates of Mordor, brightly lit bymegawatts of neonlights.   Spiegel walked between the two men, the tall Boromir and theher-sized Sam.  She was happy.  For the first time since she was ten shesmiled and was happy.  Sam thought her dazzling.  She told them:"Between you you have cured me of my anorexia."   "Glad to hear it, dear."   "Only one thing mars my happiness.  Well, two things.  One of you isgay, and the other has a fiancée.  I can't have neither of you."  Shegiggled.   Boromir sighed.  "Well, it can't be helped.  But you are a prettygirl.  You should have your pick of men, once we are in decent lands."   "I have never been to decent lands," she replied.
  Before the next day dawned they were well into the student residentialarea of Mordor.  The old shopping and dining districts with their distinctiveurban sprawl were behind them.  Before them, darkling against pallid sky,the great dormitories reared up threateningly.  Upon the west of Mordor marched the Ethel Duwap, the Mountains of Jazzwhich Sauron had renovated in yet another of his musical "renaissances".The hobbits and Boromir observed that whom the Valar would drive mad,they indeed first destroyed.  Upon the northern border the Ered Lithography,grey and steep, gave many a geography student of Muddle-earth pause withtheir frighteningly confusing contours.  But as these ranges approached oneanother, being indeed but parts of one great wall about the gigantic parkinglots of Lithlad Station and the Mall of Gorgoroth with its factory outletsskirting the posh waterfront of Lake Nurnenshire, they swung out long armsnorthward; and between these arms was a deep defile.  This was CirithGoogol, the Mystical Pass, the entrance to the land of the Enemy.  Highcliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from its mouth were twosheer hills, black-boned and bare.  Upon them stood the Teeth of Mordor,two towers strong and tall.  In days long past, they were built by the Menof Gondor to taunt Sauron, and indeed the exterior of each was stillgraven with many mocking runes; but the strength of Gondor failed, and menslept, and their amusement parks stood empty, not least of them thisoutpost.  Then Sauron returned, and had the last laugh.  Now thetowers, which had fallen into decay, were repaired, and filled with studentsof the musical and literary arts, ceaselessly scribing and generating reamsof hackneyed tripe year upon year.  Stony-faced the dorms were, with darkwindow-holes staring north and east and west across the Googol Quad, andeach window was full of sleepless eyes.  Across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had builta rampart of stone.  In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon itsbattlements sat the laziest-looking campus security orcs that Sam couldever have imagined.  Beneath the hills on either side of the rock was avast network of underground libraries, late-night cafes, and mediocre jazzjoints.  There a host, the denizens of these caves, lurked, ready at asignal to issue forth like vast legions of undergraduates going to class.None could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not be pressed against a sheerwall of tired and very ornery people with caffeine-reddened eyes, unlessthey were summoned by Sauron, and knew the secret passwords that would openthe back gates of his land.  The two hobbits gazed at the towers, the wall, and Boromir in despair.Even from a distance they could see the rent-a-cops munching donuts uponthe wall, and the endless stream of muttering students streaming out of anestablishment that was labeled "JAVA" in very flowery Tengwar.  Winging theheavy air in a straight flight a raven, were it inclined to savor thisatmosphere of despondency, would have flown but a furlong from theirhiding-place to the black summit of the nearer dorm.  Day came, and the fallow sun blinked over the almost artificial-lookingridges of Ered Lithography.  Then suddenly the peal of an enormouscarillion was heard, calling the student body of the University of NorthernMordor to arise.  This was followed by the cry of brazen-throated trumpetsfrom a hundred classrooms across campus not fifteen minutes later.  Anotherdreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor, and the day students,sleep-deprived and fell, were marching to their morning classes.  The steelof their bicycles gleamed dimly on the battlements.  "Well, here we are!" said Sam.  "Here's the Gate, and it looks to me as ifthat's about as far as we are ever going to get.  My word, but the Gafferwould have an endless stream of abuse to heap upon me if he saw me now!Often said I was dumber than a post and the dirt it was planted in, he did.But now I don't suppose I'll ever see dear old Dad again.  He'll miss hischance of You worthless idiot, if you had HALF your wits you could atleast live up to your name... Call yourself a WORKER?  You're a disgraceto the Cause!  But he could go on ragging on me as long as he'd gotbreath, if only I could see his drug-addled face again.  "I suppose it's no good asking 'what way do we go now?'  We can't go nofurther - unless we want to ask the Orcs for directions."  "No, no!" shrieked Spiegel.  "No use.  Can't ask fat cops for directions,they is useless, they is.  Spiegel said: we'll go to the Gate, and nowwe sees.  Time to go home."  "Now wait a minute!" shouted Boromir.  "I brought us this far, and Isay we go on!"  "No you didn't!" said a voice that sounded like Sam's.  "Yes, I did!" insisted Boromir.  "We doesn't think so, preciouss.  He didn't get us through the marshes, didhe?" said Spiegel.  "Stabs nice Master and feeds him to the alligators, hedoes.  Not nice Man."  "I didn't see you complaining!" cried Boromir defensively.  "Besides,you haven't heard MY side of the story!  Frodo stabbed ME..."  "Now, see here, I know he stabbed you, and that's a fact.  But I also sawyou telling him terrible stories about how Sauron was planning to cheat himof his inheritance and overrun the Shire..." countered Sam, or so it seemed.  "He WILL overrun the Shire!  And he'll put opera houses in every town fromHobbiton to Bree!  I wouldn't put it past him to set up a branch campus ofthe Mordor Academy for the Performing Arts in Michel Delvi---"  "DAWN TAKE YOU ALL AND BE STONE TO YOU!" thundered a voice that soundedlike Gandalf's, at least to Boromir.  Truth to tell, Boromir wasreally feeling the effects of his injuries, a ride down the Anduinstrapped into a boat, and the dreadful voice of Frodo's unquiet spirit,which had haunted him since the hobbit's untimely murder and dismembermenttwo nights ago.  At this final pronouncement, Boromir could take nomore. "Frodo, come back!" he shrieked.  "A madness took me, but it haspassed! Come back!"  Finally Boromir fell prone as if indeed petrifiedby the dawn.  As Spiegel and Sam looked on in utter amaze, Frodo crept up the path andgreeted Boromir.  The dumbstruck man shrieked anew and dashed intothe defile, hollering, "I see deead people!"  The last time the hobbitsglimpsed him, he was being hounded by a detachment of fraternity typeswho had placed a large horned helmet on his head in some sort of hazingritual.  Spiegel screamed, "Wraiths!  Wraiths with hairy feet!" and began to followBoromir into the defile, but Frodo grabbed her still-emaciated wristand hauled her back by main force.  Sam cowered from Frodo's advancingform until Frodo noticed his growing fear and laughed. "What's thematter, Sam?  You look as if you've seen an invisible hobbit!"  Sam, still baffled, stumbled, "You mean you've been using IT?  To foolBoromir into thinking you... you're alive after all, then?!"  "By Eru, Spiegel, I think he's got it!" chuckled Frodo at thestill-hissing Gullible.  "But Master... how did you survive being stabbed through the heart withthat sword of Boromir's?"  "Haven't you seen how he filed that thing on a ROCK?!  That's no way totreat a sword, if you can call it that!  The thing almost bent double onthis trusty suit of mithril mail here, though I've got another scar formy trouble.  Suffice it to say that he missed any vitals."  "But how did you escape the alligators?  I saw them rolling you in theswamp..."  "Fortunately, I have some knowledge of hapkido, which the Elves callEru ex machina.  It's just a fancy term for escaping death with aneat trick, say, a Ring of Power.  The gators couldn't see me, either."  "But... but... all that red miasma that bubbled up..."  "I'm afraid that was a pack of strawberry creme-filled twinkiesweighted down with your pots, Sam.  Who would have thought thatalligators like those, eh?"  At this awful revelation, Sam drew his sword and prepared to run thebourgeois scum through in earnest, but Frodo looked so beatific havingjust returned from the dead that he through better of it.  Sam, stillabstracted and bemused, saw that all traces of the sometimes broodingyoung man he had known before were gone.  The confused nouveauriche bachelor had vanished.  Even the decadent young esquire who hadmade unwanted advances upon him in the trek through the marshes nolonger existed.  In their place stood the form of Frodo son of Drogo,the Eternal Hobbit, shimmering in the faint light of Sting.  "All right, that's enough gawking," said Frodo, breaking Sam's reverie."I told you that I purpose to enter Mordor, and I know no other way.Therefore I shall go this way.  I do not ask anyone to go with me,unless he still seeks to be rid of the Dark Tyrant."  At this Spiegelgnawed at her well-worn nails and thought of the tyrant that had ruledher every waking (and bingeing, and purging) moment since the day shehad gone fishing with her friend Schmiegel.  "No, no, master!" she wailed, pawing at Frodo, and seeming in direhunger.  "No use that way!  No use!  Don't take the Precious to Him!Stay out of Mordor!  He'll eat us all, if He gets it, eat all theworld, and vomit it up into Lake Nurnenshire.  And you'll not have apenny of your inheritance.  Keep it, nice master.  Or better yet, giveit... to old Spiegel!"  "Get out of my way, you... dame of Udun!" exploded Frodo.  Spiegelcowered now, covering her ears against the awful thunder of Frodo'svoice.  "I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore Ishall go," said Frodo.  "Neither would I be cheated out of mybirthright," he added vigorously.  Sam said nothing.  The look on Frodo's face was enough for him; heknew better than to ever get between the Master and his money.  Wordswere useless.  Deeds, gratuitously violent ones, would see his Causethrough.  And after all he never had any real hope in the affair fromthe beginning; but being an incorrigible fanatic he had not needed hope,so long as imperialist blood was available to be shed.  But he hadstuck to his master all the way, even when he had seen him apparentlychewed to pieces by river-dwelling alligators; that strange resolve,too, was part of what made him a Gamgee.  Yes, all through the historyof the Shire and before, the Gamgees had been renowned for being rabid,seething revolutionaries who served a mean cup of tea, passionatefighters who were just earnest enough to remain loyal to the landedgentry who adopted them (and, truth to tell, just too dumb NOT to).  Gullible, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet.  She kneltat Frodo's feet, wringing her hands and shrieking several octaveshigher than the hobbits had ever heard her do.  "Not this way, master!"she pleaded.  "There is... another..." she grated.  Frodo and Sampeered at her intently.  As if releasing her last breath, she panted,"... shortcut!"  "Another shortcut!" said Frodo hopefully, looking down at Gullibleeagerly.  "By the Valar, perhaps we can get into Mordor without allthat crap Galadriel showed me in her mirror!  All that intrigue,fighting and killing - it really had me, well, blue."  "Yess!  Yess indeed!  There was another shortcut.  Spiegel found it.Let's go and see if it's still there!"  "You have not spoken of this before."  "No. Master did not ask.  Master was conservative, sedentary homebody.Speigel says to self, if Master wants to live out life in fear, lethim.  Then voice in Spiegel's head says, no, no, no, Spiegel promisednot to lead them into lethal tra-- err, wrong voice.   Voice says,even the smallest person can change the course of the future.  Spiegelwants to help."  "What a coincidence!  Galadriel said the very same thing to me!"  Sam frowned.  If he could have drawn his barrow-blade and held it toSpiegel's waifishly thin throat, pressing its point into the hollow ofher wrinkled flesh, menacing her inch by inch until she relented andexplained what she meant by "lead them into lethal tra--", he would havedone.  But Sam, remembering how Spiegel had indeed uttered these wordsin a bizarre debate with herself, found it hard to believe that anyonewith that many voices in her head could hatch a coherently treacherousplot.  At least, the Elvish-aphorism-uttering part(s) of Spiegel, whom hecalled Witty, seemed to have the bitter-spinster part(s), whom he calledBiddy, under control.  And of course, both had catastrophic eatingdisorders, severe enough to keep Witty/Biddy from getting far inMordor's college town without the Enemy's notice.  "And it's a good thing neither half of the old girl don't know what I'mtrying to get master to do," he thought.  "If she knew that I'm goingto get her Precious into the fire if it means tossing dear Mr. Frodo,kicking and screaming, into the roiling pit of molten lava with my barehands, ahem, well, she might not be so eager.  Perhaps I'll be able todistract her with a twinkie when the time comes.  It's beyond anyGamgee to come up with more than a basic tactical plan, anyhoo.  I justhope Mr. Frodo doesn't decide that he wants his inheritance more thanhe wants Sauron and the Nazdaq all dead as doornails.  He's as wise asany, or so they keep telling me, but he's a greedy son-of-a---"  "All right, Spiegel," interjected Frodo, putting an end to Sam's silentdeliberation.  "I trusted you once, and it nearly got me run throughand torn into bite-sized pieces, but anyone could have led me into thewaiting hands of a psychopathic killer.  I'm willing to call it anhonest mistake and let bygones be bygones.  Indeed it seems that I mustdo so, if I am to get my hands on the estate that Sauron's minions havepromised me.  But I warn you, Spiegel, you are in danger."  "Yes, yes, master!" said Gullible.  "Spiegel is surrounded by fattyfoods!  Her bones shake to think of the calories, but she doesn't runaway.  You will find adventure or it will find you, Spiegel's uncletold her long ago."  "I did not mean the danger that we all share," said Frodo, glancingdown at the spare tire that he had acquired since leaving Lothlorien."I mean a danger to yourself alone.  You swore a promise by that whichyou call the Precious.  Remember that!  It will hold you to it, but itwill find the most semantically perverse interpretation possible.Already you can feel word senses and speech acts being twisted.  Yourevealed yourself to me just now, foolishly."  At this Spiegel and Samwise both looked stuporously at their pants.  "No, you idiots!  Give it back... to old Spiegel, she said.  Nowthe Precious is giving back all the bad mojo that our murderous ladyfriend here has dished out over the years!  Throttled your childhoodgirlfriend, did you, Spiegel?  Was she more popular than you were?Did you think she had a shaplier figure?"  "Told you, did he?" sobbed Spiegel.  "But Gandalf never told youwhat happened to Schmiegel, did he?"  Frodo paused, momentarily confused.  "What do you mean?  He told meenough!  He told me you killed her!"  "No.  I am Schmiegel." said Spiegel simply.  "That was the nicknamethat my Grandmother gave me when I was a little girl.  One day - itwas my birthday - I was fishing in the river and dropped my pole.  Idove in after it and saw something glittering at the bottom.  I cameup with it and saw that it was a golden ring.  I-- I tried to put iton, but---"  "But you couldn't, could you?" said Sam softly.  "You see, I really was fat."  "No, you weren't, Spiegel.  The Precious was using you then, even as itis now."  "That's not true!  It can't be!  It's impossible!" cried Spiegel.  "Search your feelings... you know it to be true," countered Frodo.  "Noooooo!" shrieked Spiegel shrilly.  Then she began to weep brokenly.  "So, when Gandalf said that Spiegel killed Schmiegel..." began Sam.  "It's true - from a certain point of view," explained Frodo.  "A certain point of view?!  That wicked old dotard!  Serves him right,being dragged to a pink fluffy death in Kringle-Dum!" exclaimed Sam,looking at the wreck of a hobbit with mingled pity and abhorrence.  "We fasted, yess, we starved, but we could never get the Precious on.Schmiegel is Kuduk for 'dumpling' in our Stoor dialect, you know.Nana could never bear to call us that after we wasted away, saddam,saddam.  Tried to hang ourselves, we did.  Twice.  But rope keptbreaking.  Burned uss, it did..."  Frodo and Sam gaped in fascinated horror.  "We ran away.  Once we loved to suck eggses, but the yolks, theydisgusted us now.  The yellow face made us look fat.  The white face,too.  We hid under the earth, ate bugs and little orcses.  Then, oneday, the Precious... the Precious..."  "It fit.  It fit because it was ready to get back to its master," musedFrodo.  "But Schmiegel was long dead, wasn't she?"  "Yess, saddam, deead, dussst and ashes."  Spiegel stopped blubberingmomentarily to blow her nose.  Frodo sighed.  There was a long, awkward silence.  Then Frodo spoke againless sternly.  "Come now, Gullible or Schmiegel if you wish, tell me ofthis other shortcut, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it,enough to justify me in turning aside from my plain path.  Time isfleeting towards the appointed hour in which I must appear to claim myestate."  But Gullible was in a pitiable state, clearly traumatized by therecounting of her tale of ruin.  It was not easy to get any clearaccount out of her, amid her sniffling and squeakings, and the frequentinterruptions in which she crawled on the ground and begged them notto look at how emaciated she had become.  After a while she grew calmer,and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the roadthat turned west of Ethel Duwap, he would come in time to a crossingin a circle of trees.  On the right a road went down to Disgiliathand the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went on southwards.  "On, on, on," said Gullible. "We never went that way, but they say itgoes on a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that isnever still.  There are lots of nice fishes there (mmm... seafood),and big birds eat fishes (mmm... big birds): but we never went there,alas, no!  never ate fried food.  And further still there are more lands,they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot there, and there are seldomany clouds, and the men have huge curved swords and talk funny and chopanything they doesn't recognize into bits.  We do not want to see thatland."  "What of the third turning?" asked Frodo.  "O yes, O yes, there is a third way," said Gullible.  "The old fortress,very old, very horrible now.  We used to hear tales from the South,when Schmiegel was young, long ago.  After dinner, when we sat by thebanks of the Great River and had dessert, saddam, saddam."  She beganto weep and mutter.  The hobbits rolled their eyes and waited again.  "Tales out of the South," Gullible went on again, "about the tall Mendressed in funny costumes, with their fair daughters whose eyes werethe size of teacups, and their cities with shops in every house, andthe silver crown of their King and his Magic Studio: wonderful tales.They built great parks, and one was set atop a hill shaped like somenameless animal, and its towers were silver-white, and there was agate, like all the gates of Gondor, collecting tribute from allwho would enter the gardens of the Sea-Kings.  O yes, there were manytales about the Tower of the Moonies."  "That would be Minas Ethel that Elendil the son of Isildur built," saidFrodo.  "It was Elendil who cut off the finger of the Enemy."  "Yes, He has only three on the Black Hand, but they are enough," saidGullible shuddering.  "And He hated Elendil's city."  "What does he not hate?  But they call it Minas Goofy now.  What has it todo with us?"  "Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the whitepavilions and the gate; but not nice now, not beautiful, just reallyexpensive.  He conquered it long ago.  It is a very terrible place now.They say an awful Singing King rules over it now, always singing terriblesongs about the coming of the shadow and what a small world it is after all.Often he is away, but when he returns... ohh!"  "But how will it help us to go this way?" demanded Sam.  "Surely the Enemy knows all about his own mountains?  Or has he sold them off to pay off hisdebts?" he asked sardonically.  "Speak not of which you know little," spat Spiegel with surprisingvehemence.  "He has many debts, not the least of which he owes to thosewho would take more than his pinky in recompense."  Frodo and Sam raisedtheir eyebrows at each other.  "Spiegel helps again, though hobbits are bitter and sarcastic.She found it.  She knows it."  "What did you find?" asked Frodo.  Gullible crouched down and her voice sank to a whisper again."A little path leading up on a 15-degree incline into the mountains; thenan 85-degree turn, then a stair, 2 fathoms wide with each step 17 inchesdeep and high, then a tunnel 3.25 fathoms in diameter and 1.211 furlongs inlength, barely illuminated at either end on nights when the moon is gibbouswaxing or fuller; and at last a little cleft, in which one human or a dwarfand a hobbit can stand shoulder-to-shoulder, connecting into a path 200 feetabout the main pass.  Got that?"  "Hold on, I'm still writing," said Sam distractedly.  "Is it not guarded?" asked Frodo sternly.  "And did you escape out ofthe darkness, Spiegel?  Were you not rather permitted to depart, withthe Enemy's sorcerous tools of map-making in hand?  That is at leastwhat Aragon thought, who found you by the Dead Marshes with that crystalaround your neck."  "It's a lie!" hissed Gullible, and a wry look came into her eyes at thename of Aragon.  "He lied on me, that fat, henpecked weed-smoker did.I did escape, all by my poor self.  And I took that crystal from somedead elf in the marshes.  Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious,and I have searched and searched, of course I have.  But not for theBlack One.  The Precious was ours, it was mine I tell you.  I didescape."  Frodo and Sam exchanged glances again.  "Denial."  "I ask you again," Frodo said.  "is this secret way guarded?"  Gullible stared at the hobbits with a resentful look.  "Is it not guarded?  Is it kindasorta guarded?"  "Yes, yes, perhaps.  No safe places in this country," said Gulliblewith an impetuous pout that recalled Arwen in one of her "moods".  They could not get her to say more.  The name of the perilous placeand the high pass she could not tell, or would not.  Its name was Cirith Googol, a name of dreadful rumour.  Aragon couldperhaps have told them its name and significance, being well acquaintedwith webs of ill repute.  But they were alone, and Aragon was smokingsome of the Shire's finest far away, and Gandalf stood amid the ruin ofIsengard and strove with Aruman, delayed by the unraveling of whatseemed to all onlookers to be a hideously complex plot.  Yet even ashe hurled Aruman down to his doom, his thought was ever upon Frodo andSamwise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope andpity...  Frodo sat on the ground, pondering anxiously all that Gandalf,Galadriel, and El Rond had said to him.  Here he was a little halflingfrom the Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet contryside, expected toremember his middle school Geography and World Cultures classes.  Itwas an evil fate.  The day drew on.  A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow wherethey lay.  Not even an eagle poised against the sun would have markedthe hobbits sitting there, silent and unmoving, in their thin greycloaks.  For a moment he might have paused to consider Gullible - thereperhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of Men - before herecalled that he was not a scavenger and moved on to stoop on some niceGondorian cattle.  Frodo's head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with handsbehind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky.  At leastfor a long while it was empty.  Then presently Sam thought he saw a darkbird-like figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and thenwheel again.  Two more followed, then a fourth.  The first three seemedto be trying to impress the fourth with aerobatic maneuvers.  A warningfear gripped Sam's vitals as he had felt in the presence of the BlackRiders, a feeling quite different from the apprehension the Fellowshiphad felt on the night that Lego-lass had shot some flying creature outof the night sky.  Sam took a deep breath.  "The Riders are about again, up in the air,"he said in a hoarse whisper.  "I saw then.  Do you think they could seeus?"  "According to Galadriel, no," replied Frodo, "but she also said I shouldstay away from 20-foot-long giant spiders.  I'm not sure she's jugglingwith all three Silmarils, if you know what I mean."  Sam suppressed his momentary hilarity to prick his keen hobbit ears ata new sound.  Singing and hoarse shouting came from the distance, butthey could hear it drawing nearer.  The fear of armed soldiers sent tocapture them hurled the travellers out of their languorous state.Frodo and Sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths.  Flight wasimpossible.  Gullible rose slowly and crawled to the lip of the hollow.  Verycautiously she peered over the rim.  She drew back and whispered, "MoreMen going to Mordor.  Dark faces.  We have not seen Men like thisbefore, no, Spiegel has not.  They are fierce.  They have black eyes,and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears, and noses, andeyebrows, and navels, yes, lots of beautiful gold.  And some havered paint on their cheeks, and red cloaks, and red kilts, and theirflags are red, and the tips of their spears..."  "Wait, are you sure these are men?" interrupted Sam.  Gullible gave him a sardonic look.  "We can tells better than you can,we thinks."  "Well, were there any oliphaunts?" asked Sam, forgetting his fear inhis eagerness for news of the strange and sensational like many of hisdescendants after him.  "No, no oliphaunts.  What are oliphaunts?" said Gullible.  Sam stood up, resting his right elbow in the palm of his left hand andstroking his chin (as he always did when 'trying to look somewhateducated'), and began:        Grey as a louse,        Big as a house,        Nose like a snake,        A big mess I make,        As I poop on the grass;        Young trees do I bash.        With horns in my mouth        I dance in the South,        Flapping big ears.        Beyond count of years        I stump round and round        I do not like my father Ham        My family life's a great big sham        My Master's head I'd gladly wham        I do not like him, Sam I am.        If ever you met me        You'd best not forget me        'Cause I'd stomp you flat        If you said I look fat        Old Oliphaunt am I,        Believe it, or die.  "That," said Sam, when he had finished reciting, "that's a rhyme we have inthe Shire."  "We can tell, Precious," answered Spiegel.
  As they waited for night to fall they rested, moving to the bottom ofthe hollow to avoid the light of the setting sun.  The three hobbitsremained silent as evening deepened and lights began to spring on inthe dorms and all-night cafes.  As darkness grew in the hollow, Samgot out the last of Spiegel's groceries and began making dinner. "I've got no POTS to fix anything fancy," he said pointedly, "but tocelebrate your return, sir, I'll add a little something special to ourmeal."  Soon, he was putting the finishing touches on three large hamand cheese sandwiches.  Just at that moment, Spiegel gave a yelp and leapt away from Sam withher eyes fixed on the lip of the hollow above him.  A dark form couldbe seen there, looming against the emerging stars.  Frodo felt a queerand curiously pleasant sense of deja vu at the sight, and he lay backon the ground expectantly.  Sam, who was closer, could make out a manin oddly archaic robes and holding some dark object in his hands.  Ina trembling voice he asked, "Who's there?"  The man took a step forward, and then began to strum on the guitar heheld and sing in a melancholy voice:   I am Feanor's boy, and my story's dark and cold,   I have squandered my resistance,   For a pocket full of marbles such are Silmarils   Made in the West.   Morgoth stole them from my father   And hacked up Grandpa's breast.   Mmmm-mm-mmmmm...   When I left my home to go cross the sea,   I was no more than a boy   in a company of warriors.   Standing by my father I an awful oath declared.   We needed boats,   so we asked our shoreland cousins if they'd help but they said no;   it was then we knew that they would have to go.  At this point, the man seemed to lose control of himself.  He whippedout a sword and began stabbing and slashing in every direction as iffighting an imagined horde of foes in a berserk rage, singing:   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die die-die-die-die die!   Regaining control, the singer began to strum his guitar again andcontinued:   As the war went on for ages, Beren took a Silmaril home,   to win Thingol's daughter.   When they died their son refused to give us back the jewel.   We marched in there   Killing men and helpless children 'cause their lord was so unfair.   Die-die die-die die, die die die die...  Although he twitched a few times as he finished the verse, themusician managed to simply play on without singing for a few minutes,gazing sadly off into space.  Suddenly, the rage came upon him again,and he once again began leaping to and fro with his sword, to therefrain:   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die die-die-die-die die! Again the madness passed, and he went on:   Now I'm chasing down these refugees and wishing for the stone:   Father's stone.   But the poor exiles don't do a thing but bleed on me...   Speeding free... father's stone.   In the clearing stands a jewel-box and two fighters holding blades   And we slay them for the treasures   That cost every love and life we had   but burned us 'til we cried out   In our anger and our shame,   "I am leaving, too much grieving," but the minstrel still remains.   Mmmm-mm-mmmmm...   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die    Die-die-die-die die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  ...  This final chorus involved the most intense leaping and slashingyet, and rather than calming down the singer seemed to get more andmore vicious and excited as he sang on.  And as Frodo, Sam, andSpiegel watched, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a momenton the brink of the hill, and with a yell came tumbling down straightinto the middle of Sam's cooking supplies.  All was suddenly silent.  After a few moments, a groan came from the heap at the bottom of thehill.  Sam, who had just gathered up his cooking gear and had begun tocreep forward to retrieve the sandwiches, leapt back to safety withFrodo, while Spiegel cowered among the packs across the hollow.  Asthe figure rose, Sam saw that it was not a man at all but an Elf, withdark hair and a hungry look in his eye.  "Wow!  Sandwiches!" exclaimed the Elf, and before they couldsay another word he had started to wolf down the nearest one.  "You haveno idea how good this tastes," he said a few minutes later.  "How didyou come by this Elvish mustard so near the gates of Mordor?"  Sam blushed and hung his head, but he found that he could not liewhile he was held by the singer's searching gaze.  "I stole a bitbefore we left Lorien, begging your pardon, sir.  I meant no harm, onmy honor!  I just have no use for trees."  The singer laughed.  "Oh, don't worry about it.  Nobody shouldkeep Elvish mustard from a true Sandwich Artist like yourself.  Did youknow that the secret of its making was taught to the Elves by Lavannaherself?  It's made from the seeds of special mustard plants broughtout of the West from the Blessed Realm.  I should tell you, though,that never before have strangers tasted the condiments of our ownpeople.  Come to think of it, you still haven't, have you?"  Grinning he reached over and began to eat the second sandwich whilethe hobbits looked on with increasing longing.  "You know what wouldgo really well with this?" asked the singer.  "A good margarita,that's what."  Frodo's eyes suddenly brightened.  "Margarita?  Do you knowEl Rond, then?  Do you come from Rivendell?"  Memories of the fairElf-maidens in Rivendell began to surface in Frodo's mind, and he somehowfound himself forgetting the deep attraction for Sam that had been growingon him for the past few weeks.  Now those Elf-maidens, they were goodcompany indeed... what could have made him forget the joy that he hadfelt in the arms of young Findu-lass?  But Frodo turned his attentionback to the minstrel as he replied.  "El Rond?  Rivendell?  Those names certainly don't sound familiar." The Elf seemed to be lost in some fair memory for a time, and then heexplained, "No, margaritas are an old family recipe, invented by myfather in the wild days of his youth.  We passed it on secretly,father to son, but my family has dwindled over time: we never had muchof an opportunity to raise children.  I myself only taught the recipeto my foster son Othar, but he and I lost touch quite some time ago."  Sam felt a tug at his memory at that, but he was more interested inother things.  "But who are you?" he asked.  The Elf once again began to sing:   I am Feanor's boy, and my story's dark and cold...  "Ach, no!" cried Spiegel.  "Please, spare Spiegel's ears!  Alreadywe puts up with hour after miserable hour of recording and re-recordingand hearing that same music over and over.  If we has to listen tothat song again, divorce you we will!"  Everyone else turned to stare confusedly at Spiegel.  "What do youmean, 'divorce you'?" asked Frodo.  "Sorry," replied Spiegel.  "I don't know what came over me.  Spiegelfelt like she was speaking the words of a distant voice from anotherworld.  Just don't sing song again and it might go away."  Sam turned back to the singer.  "Let me put this another way: what isyour name?"  "Oh, my name is Maglor," he answered.  "Maglor!" exclaimed Frodo.  "Feenamint's son Maglor?  But whatwere all those strange names in your song?"  "Strange names?  Ah, right, you're used to hearing the Gnomishnames.  You see, when my people left the Blessed Realm, we had a bitof a falling out.  Some of us took boats straight across the sea,while the rest decided to walk all the way back to Middle-earth.  Theyhad to hike all the way north to the great mountain Stardock to getaround the sea, of course, and what's more they had to climb straightover her.  All the way up her bare, wind-scoured west wall, across theTresses, down the Ladder, and across to Obelisk Polaris they went, andthen they somehow contrived to lower the whole troop down its sheersides.  With so many women and children along, you can imagine thattheir losses were heavy indeed."  Sam seemed puzzled.  "If it was so dangerous, and they had women andchildren with them, then it don't make much sense for them not to takethe boats, and you can't deny it."  Maglor seemed distinctly uncomfortable, and was quite relieved whenFrodo broke in to repeat his question.  "But what about the names? And what do you mean by Gnomish?"  "Oh, didn't you know?  Whole cities of Ice Gnomes live up there, inthe caves of Stardock.  The Elves who crossed her became great friendsof the Gnomes, and even adopted parts of their language into theirown.  Some of the Elves even decided to stay there with them anddecorate their mountaintop homes with the gems and treasures they hadbrought from the West.  At any rate, once the rest of us got backtogether here in Middle-earth, their language caught on, and trueProto-Elvish is rarely heard anymore."  With that, Maglor grabbed thelast of the sandwiches and began munching on it contentedly.  The last light of day had long since vanished and the moon was sinkingas Sam, Frodo, and Spiegel began to gather the bags for the next stageof their journey.  Maglor lay on the other side of the hollow, gazingup at the stars and humming to himself.  Sam wasn't at all sure howmuch to trust him after the madness of his song, but he hoped thatsoon they would be safely away: the Elf hadn't stirred since hefinished the last of the sandwiches well over an hour before.  To Sam's dismay, however, the Elf soon sat up and took note of theirpreparations.  "Frodo," he called, "what is the relic of power thatyou bear?  It seems to have a deep hold on you."  Frodo spun round to face Maglor in surprise.  "What do you know ofthe ri-, er, relic?"  "Little is hidden from these eyes, Frodo.  Those who have lived in theBlessed Realm lead a strange dual life, living at once in theNeighborhood of the Seen and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Whatever it is that you carry, it casts a great shadow in the unseenland.  I myself carried a thing of Power for a time, and I know whatits effects can be.  Does your burden toy with you as mine toyed withme?"  "What do you mean, toy with me?" asked Frodo.  "Did you, too, beginto see your own burden in your dreams as an ever growing wheel of fire,inescapably engulfing all other thoughts and memories until it aloneoccupied your thought?"  "No, can't help you there," replied Maglor, "but it sure playedhavoc with my sex life.  One minute I found myself longing for thecompany of women, the next for men, and back again without even amoment's warning.   It was interesting for a while, but eventually thething just got out of control.  It sometimes went for years at a timefilling me with burning desire but never allowing me to followthrough.  I finally got rid of my treasure after it drove me to spenda desperate but fruitless week snorkeling and looking for amiablebluefish."  "You know," mused Frodo, "that sounds disturbingly familiar."  AsSam and Spiegel stared at him, he hurriedly added, "all but the fish,of course," and concentrated intently on his shoelaces.  "You really ought to get rid of the thing," Maglor suggested.  "Mybrother had good luck dumping his in a pit of molten rock.  Well, notsuch good luck, actually, but at least it didn't bother him anymore. I hear there's a good sized volcano over in Gorgoroth that might dothe trick.  Incidentally, where are we going?"  Inwardly, Sam groaned, and he glanced nervously over at Spiegel tosee if she had made the connection.  It was bad enough that this foolof an Elf was inviting himself into their group, but if he managed toclue Spiegel in to the danger to her Precious there would be realtrouble.  As she began to speak, he reached for his sword, but inrelief he realized that she was still miraculously oblivious to theirplans.  "Master plans to enter Mordor," Spiegel said.  "We takes him downalong mountains, walks many days, gets good exercise.  Take secretshortcut into Black Land, yes, so master isn't taken straight to Him."  "That sounds like quite a hike.  Why not just go through the dorms?"Maglor asked.  "Security is remarkably lax.  I should know: I used tobe a music professor here.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, some ofthese nearer corridors lead straight from the coffee shops and jazzclubs here to Durthang House on the far side of the mountains.  Itshouldn't be a bad trip at all, and you might even be able to pinchyourselves some bicycles once you get to the other side."  The hobbitsall saw the sense in this, and soon they finished packing their bagsand crept toward the darkness of Mordor.  It was deepest midnight by the time they reached the mouth of thecorridor that Maglor said would lead them to Durthang House, but theircare had paid off, for they had successfully avoided all of thesecurity orcs on the way.  Sam eagerly ran towards the opening, butjust as he was about to pass into it he felt a shock: as if he had runinto some invisible wall.  They all looked about, and there within theshadow of the doorway they saw the Two Watchers.  They were terrible figures standing on either side of the path, filledwith hidden menace.  Each of their faces had a terrible, vulture-likebeak, and their outstretched clawlike hands seemed to tear up at thevery sky, while their feet ended in grasping talons.  The thingsseemed to be carved out of huge blocks of pale white stone, but whereeach of the them seemed to hold in its left foot the body of asuffering enemy the talons were painted red as freshly spilled blood. Red as blood, too, was a single claw on the right hand of each beast,as if they had plunged their razor sharp thumbs into their foes insome dark ritual of torture, and those claws were held just beyond theWatchers' noses while their forked outstretched tongues stretched tocatch the dripping blood.  The lethal right foot of each monsterstretched its talons toward the open door as if to ward off all whodared approach their domain, and the few lights from outside glintedoff of crowns set of their brows that appeared to be made of thegilded bones of human fingers.  For all that they were made of stone,the monsters seemed aware: some dreadful spirit of evil vigilancestared out through their cruel eyes, which were fixed with fearsomeintensity upon their bloody claws.  As if to show that they carednothing for their own pain, each creature was piercing its own leftthumb with the smallest, needle-sharp claw of its opposing hand, andslashes along their chests showed where they had cut themselves forthe sheer joy that they found in agony.  The Watchers' dark stonycapes seemed to meld into the walls, so that to enter the hallway atall seemed to place one within that awful embrace, giving up withouthope to their devouring hatred of all living things.  Frodo and Sam stared at the monstrous guardians of the passage withhorror, and even Maglor seemed taken aback by their foul visage and bythe strange barrier that had prevented Sam from penetrating beyondthem into the corridor.  At that moment, they heard Spiegel cry outfrom beyond the statue on the left.  "Aha!  Here's the latch!" she said, and she reappeared as she pulledopen the sliding glass door that Sam had struck like an unwary bird. Looking back at them, she called out, "You guys coming?"  They all moved forward to pass through the door, when to their horrorthey found that something was waiting for them on the other side:standing before them was a short, geriatric fellow with big eyes, acomplexion lighter than the pale Watchers', and a half eaten cave fishin his hand.  "Ach, thanks, saddam.  We couldn't find tricksyhandles in the dark, no, saddam.  Gulible will be on his way... say,now, saddam, what a tasty little dish she is, yes, and just my size. Not nassty Elvish wench, no, saddam."  Having finally noticed theattractive form of his liberator, Gulible began to paw at Spiegel andfluff her hair.  Finally, he wrapped her in a great hug, and heldtightly while she began to squirm with discomfort, not knowing whatwould make the creature stop invading her personal space.  Frodo and Sam stared at Spiegel and Gulible in complete confusion,trying to sort out who was who.  Finally, Sam could take it no more. "Here, now, leave Spiegel alone," he said, and pulled her free ofGulible's embrace.  "Who are you, anyway?"  "You knows who we is, yess, saddam.  Set nasty trips and trapsfor us, they did, as we takes little sightseeing vacation along river. Never lets us get close enough to see pretty Elf-maidens bathing, no. And when we finally gets a chance to talk to false tricksy Elfstrumpet again, does she say, 'Sorry, Gulible'?  No, she just says,'Get Orcs'.  Well, we may be slow, saddam, but we knows when enoughis enough.  We says, 'No more Elfses', and comes here to get fisssh. But now we sees pretty hobbit lass, yesss, and maybe hobbit girlsaren't so tricksy, saddam."  Sam pushed him away before he couldbegin to fluff Spiegel's hair again.  Spiegel pulled away from Gulible's reaching hands, but it was clearthat she was flattered.  "We've got the same nickname, huh?"  Frodo now turned to Spiegel, demanding, "But then who are you?"  "I'm Spiegel, same as I've always been.  What do you mean, 'who areyou'?"  "Then, you didn't bear my burden?  You aren't tied to me by a bond offate and foreshadowing stretching across hundreds of years?  Are youtelling me that we've been traveling with some random stranger we mealong the way, someone without any hidden identity that will laterprove useful or a deep symbolic reflection of my own potential doom?"  "'Fraid so," replied Spiegel.  "What kind of fairy-tale world doyou think we live in, anyway?"  Sam couldn't bear the host of contradictions that seemed to bespringing up in every direction.  "But what about the Ring, yourPrecious?  You told us all about that, and you even asked master togive it back!"  "My Precious!" cried Gulible.  "Yes, yesss, that's what we needs!  Ifthe Baggins gives back the Precious, she won't shy away, saddam. Give it back, give it back to us!"  He ran over and began to paw atFrodo's chest, until Frodo aimed a kick at him and Gulible backedaway.  "He's got your Precious, too?" Spiegel asked Gulible with growingire.  Turning back to Frodo, she went on, "And what about that oldring?  I told you, it didn't fit, so I threw it out."  Frodo felt dizzy, and leaned back against the nearest of the TwoWatchers.  Its cold stone surface pressed against his back.  "Justwhat is your Precious, Spiegel?" he asked.  "You know perfectly well what it is, you jerk.  The pretty littledress that my aunt May gave me, and that you took away just becausemy dad was a bit late with a payment to old Sharkey."  "So when you muttered 'saddam'..."  "Sorry, I couldn't quite understand you there," said Spiegel, lookinggenuinely confused.  "It sounds like you've got something caught inyour throat."  Frodo slouched in defeat.  "I hate to interrupt," said Maglor, entering the conversation for thefirst time, "but if we want to get through to Durthang House beforethe students start stirring about in the morning we should really getgoing."  The whole group shrugged, and the five of them marchedtogether into the hallway.  The tunnel seemed to have no end.  All they knew was that it was goinguphill pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of atwist and a turn or two.  There were hallways leading off to the sideevery now and then, as they knew by the glimmer of peepholes in thedoors and by the sounds of distant late-night student parties.  Maglorseemed sure of his way, so the hobbits took little notice of theseside passages, except to hurry past for fear that they would have toexplain themselves to one of the few campus security orcs whoperiodically got up enough energy to wander through the halls.  On andon they went, and up and up; and still they heard no sound of anythingexcept the occasional second-rate strumming of would-be musicians ortheir popular idols.  Maglor seemed dismayed by this at first, till itbecame too frequent to bother about.  Sam could not tell how long theykept on like that, quickly walking on, on, on until they were morethan weary.  Suddenly without any warning they heard a "meow" from just a few yardsin front of them, and a small kitten came around a corner and sat downin their path.  The group stopped, and they all held their breath withapprehension, when they heard a voice from down the adjoining hallway. It called out, "What have you found, Shiro?"  Around the corner came a young man wearing jeans and a rumpled T-shirt.  As soon as he saw Maglor and the hobbits, he gave an evillaugh.  "I haven't seen that many shocked and frightened faces sinceNickerson gave that pop quiz last fall.  Trespassing, I guess: youcertainly don't look like students."  As Maglor reached for his blade,the student reached into his own pocket and pulled out a whistle. "I'll make you a deal," he went on.  "If you follow me back to my roomand do as I say, I won't blow this emergency whistle."  Seeing thatthey had no choice, the company obeyed.  After a short walk, they were ushered into a small but brightly litdorm room.  The first thing that hit Sam's senses was the smell: atleast a dozen litter boxes were scattered about the floor, and all ofthem seemed desperately in need of attention.  Cats lounged all overthe room, some of them cute and harmless like Shiro but others nastyand brutish as they come.  As Sam took in his new surroundings, theircaptor locked the door behind them.  "Welcome to the humble abode of Tevildo Nobunaga," he said.  "I'mgoing to sleep, but your night is just beginning.  If you don't wantme to turn you over to the orcs, you'll have to clean out those litterboxes completely before I wake up, and be quiet about it!  Just tomake sure you don't try to sneak out during the night, I'm going tohave Miaowara Tomokato here guard the door."  At those words, a largeand graceful cat crossed the room and sat blocking the door, butdespite its relaxed appearance Sam could tell that it was a highlytrained fighter: it would be impossible to slip by without a fight.   Tevildo climbed into his bed and was soon breathing deeply as heslept.  Meanwhile, Maglor and the hobbits began the loathsome taskthat they had been set.  The work went slowly, and by the time an hourhad passed they had only finished cleaning the fourth box.  The catguarding the door had fallen into a doze as well, but the twitching ofhis whiskers showed that he slept lightly.  This was enough for Maglor, however.  He motioned the others to drawclose, and shared his plan.  "I have with me an ancient Elvish salvethat carries a potent enchantment of sleep and forgetfulness.  Ittakes no more than a touch for it to take effect, so as soon as theguard is asleep we must flee immediately, before any of the other catsrecognize what we're doing and alert their master."  With that, he crept toward Miaowara and drew a small box of Elvishwood out of his robes.  As he removed the lid, Sam glimpsed a 'G' runeetched in its top, and a terrible fear sprang into his mind.  In adesperate whisper Sam warned, "Don't put mustard on the cat!"  Tevildo groaned and rolled over in his sleep.  Maglor, who had pausedand half turned at the sound of Sam's whisper, snapped around to lookat their captor, and in that motion a large dollop of fine Elvishmustard fell from the box and landed with a splat on the head ofMiaowara Tomokato.  With a burst of sudden fury, the warrior cat was awake and lashing outat Maglor with all his strength.  Before the Elf could even draw hissword, Tomokato had slashed into both of his legs with razor sharpclaws while giving a loud meowing battle scream.  As Maglor leapt backto defend himself, Tevildo sat straight up in bed and gave a greatblow on his whistle, summoning campus security.  Swift escape was now their only hope, and Frodo was able to lead thehobbits around the battle to the door.  As Maglor and the warrior catcircled each other, trading feints and testing thrusts in search ofweakness, Spiegel managed to open the lock and throw open the door. The distant stomp of running orcs could be heard down the hall.  Thehobbits desperately waited for Maglor to break free of his battle sothey could flee.  Precious moments passed, and the orcs' approachbecame ever louder.  Suddenly, Tevildo's eyes widened as he stared past the combat to theopen door.  "The dorm no-pet policy!" he gasped.  "Out!  Out, all ofyou, this instant!  Miaowara, fall back!"  Before they knew what washappening, Maglor and the hobbits found themselves shoved out into thehallway as the door slammed shut and locked behind them.  Tevildo'slight went out, and the only sounds to be heard were the grunts of thesecurity orcs just around the corner.  Gulible was the first to turn and run, and the rest followed close onhis heels.  However clumsy he might have been on the riverside, heproved to have some skill in evasion, for soon the noise of thepursuing orcs grew distant and finally vanished.  Once they wereconvinced that they had outrun their hunters, the companions stoppedin a dark hallway to catch their breath and plan their next move.  Still gasping, Sam panted, "Must have... switched... boxes... whenyou... fell."  Maglor nodded, and sat down to tend to his injuredlegs.  After a few minutes, Frodo began to take control of thesituation.   "Good work, Gulible," said Frodo.  "Now, do you know the way to getback out?"  "Ach, no, saddam," he replied.  "Gulible thinks only of escapingfrom nasty cruel orcses, not about which twistings and turnings hetakes, saddam."  Frodo turned to their earlier guide.  "Maglor?  Do you know thisplace?"  "No, I have no memory of it at all," Maglor answered.  "It must be oneof the new dorms that have been 'under construction' since even beforeI taught here.  I'm afraid that means that we are closer to the way weentered than to Durthang House, but at least we can hope that there isan exit nearby that we can reach before day traps us inside."  Sam was staring at the walls in the all but nonexistent light.  "Lookhere, master," he said, grimacing at how easily the term came to hislips: that would have to change.  "It almost looks like there might bea map on this side.  Too bad there aren't emergency lights here, orsome other light for when all other lights go out."  "That's it!" cried Frodo.  "The Lady's stone!"  He quickly pulled outGaladriel's gift, but it lay dark and lifeless in his hand.  "Wasn't there something you were supposed to say, sir?" suggested Sam. "Some name or other?  Something about lumber?"  Frodo held up the stone, and said, "All the saws here!"  As it hadbefore, it glowed brightly in his hand, and the light it made revealedwhat was indeed a map, showing an exit barely over a mile away.  Italso revealed an overpowering rage in the face of Maglor.  "Mine!  That light is mine!" he yelled.  Quick as lightning, hissword was out of its scabbard and he leapt up screaming and slashingtoward Frodo and the other hobbits.  They fled down the hall towardthe exit, as they heard the crazed refrain spring up behind them:   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die    Die-die-die-die die! ...  And on it went, repeating again and again as they ran for their livesbefore the berserk madman.  They would have been caught and slain longsince, except that Maglor's longer legs had just been injured inbattle.  Even so, his greater size and strength began to tell, and Sambegan to lose hope.  Spiegel was still regaining muscle, after all,and all this running was taking its toll: she was already gasping forbreath and struggling to go on.  Sam prepared himself to turn and diefighting as a good revolutionary should.  Just at that moment, another Elf sprang out of a side passage andfloored Maglor with a right cross to the jaw.  "Gotcha again, yousecond-rate quitter!" the newcomer sneered.  At the end of theirstrength anyway, the hobbits slumped to a stop and turned to watch.  "Daeron!" exclaimed Maglor.  "How nice of you to drop by, what withyour busy solo career and all."  The two Elves eyed each other warily.  "It didn't have to be a solo career, but you just had to be a moviestar, didn't you?" Daeron parried.  "Not that I'm interested inworking with the guy who slew so many nephews and cousins of mine inDoriath."  "You weren't even there, so what do you know?" countered Maglor. "You'd already run off lonely and sobbing years and years earlier,just because you'd let some dirty Man take away your Lustianne. What were you doing all that time that was so much more important thandefending your homeland?"  "You bastard!" yelled Daeron, and soon the two were boxing back andforth across the hall.  Frodo motioned that it was time for the hobbits to make good theirescape, and Sam and the others followed toward the exit.  Just as theyjogged out of view, they heard Maglor scream out to them from thedistance, "Know this, Frodo!  I will pursue you with vengeance andhatred to the ends of the World so long as you shall keep from me thatstone that bears the light bound by my fath--", at which moment aparticularly loud thump cut his oath short.  With that, the hobbitsburst forth from the exit and found themselves at the edge of a faircountry of climbing woods and swift-falling streams, less than an hourbefore the coming of a new day.
    In the delightful new country in which they found themselves, the hobbitsthanked Eru, the Valar, and the renowned Elven-singer Daeron (of Daeron andGlorfinkel fame) that they had escaped the wrath of Maglor the Possessive.They used the few moments before the break of dawn to get away as far aspossible from the evil place. When daylight became too revealing, they founda hole in which to hide themselves. As their breathing became less uneasyFrodo turned to Sam and asked, "Well, Sam, what do you think of the Elvesnow?" in a sarcastic manner which forced Sam once again to control his Fistof Death. "I recall you were already sick of them when we were in Lorien."    "Aye, that I was," said Sam.  "But now I'd gae further an' say they're abunch o' greedy, selfish, grasping feudal anachronisms."    "Bolsheviks, I call them," said Frodo disgustedly.  Sam just smiledenigmatically.    Suddenly Frodo remembered the Stone of Galadriel, and the strange effectit had had on Maglor. He took the stone out of his pocket and looked at itas it shined on the morning sun, as if a living flame dwelled within it.    "Could it be that this is indeed one of the Slipcasts, which werethought to be lost Ages ago?", he said wondering.    "No, no! That is not what the grazy music-teacher said to us," arguedSpiegel. "He only spoke of the Light inside it, that the light belonged tohis father, or something. Besides he's soo graazy! No. Give it to us! Giveit to Spiegel. Come on! You still owe me for that dress!"    "Hey now! I got that dress fair and square," answered Frodo angrily."Besides it wouldn't fit you anyway, you fat slob!"    Spiegel flinched as if she had been hit in the face, and turned awaywith tears in her eyes. Frodo stood above her breathing heavily. Suddenlyhe felt as if a cloud had passed away from his eyes. "What did I say? OhSpiegel, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. It was the Ring, I tell you.The Ring!"    Sam looked at him and the stone he was holding. Suddenly he rememberedFrodo, as he had been in the Barrows, a small and insecure, confused littleHobbit. Borish-bourgeois yes, but that was understandable considering hisbackground. But not this monster he had become.    "Maybe not," he said. "Maybe it has not been the Ring, but that accursedstone all along, that has been twisting your mind. You saw what it did toMaglor. Think about it! All the evil things - the Boromir incident, all thatchanging of sexual preferences - have happened after Galadriel gave youthat stone."    "But why would the benevolent Galadriel have done such a thing?" Frodoasked. "Or are you suggesting that Galadriel has some kind of evil twinsister, and she gave me that stone while the real Gladdy was hidden issome dark dungeon?"    "I don't know," said Sam. "But I do know that we need somebody learnedto help us with this mystery. Somebody who has knowledge and wisdom.Somebody with good heart and sharp brains. Somebody noble, yet friendly,somebody with special - something..."    "All right, all right. Just don't start singing no matter what you do,"said Spiegel nervously.    Deciding to set their jewellery problems aside for a while, Frodo gazedat the lovely countryside, and Sam listened in delight as the birds warbledthe sweet notes of the Pastoral Symphony.    "This is the land of the Enemy?" he muttered.  "And by the way, who theblazes is leading us these days?  Between Spiegel and Gulible, I'm sairflummoxed, I are."    "We can both lead, my Precious," wheezed Gulible to Spiegel in a grotesqueattempt at seductive charm. "We goes together like a fissh and fisshbone, wedoess."    "Um, you can lead," replied Spiegel.  "I'll take up the rear." Havingsaid this she promptly moved as far away from Gulible as possible.    They walked by a babbling brook, where the frogs sang the MoonlightSonata. Presently Frodo turned to Spiegel and remarked, "I've noticedsomething odd about you, Spiegel.  From one cha... moment to the next youseem to adopt a different style of speech.  Sometimes you talk like Gulible,sometimes you talk like Yoda, sometimes you talk like the wife of a famousshire-author, whose name escapes me... Why is this?"    "In my youth, I used to channel," replied Spiegel. "In those days, Icould control my gift, because of the dress Baggins stole."  Her eyesglowed with a reddish-purple glow of resentment, before she went on.    "When he -- it -- you took the dress, I lost the ability to distinguishourselves from others, and our identity became confuzzled, my Precious. Theonly thing that can save me is pure love, but that I will not find until Imeet a handsome racially stigmatized stranger. If you would know more, crossmy palm with silver."    "No, thank you, that's enough," said Frodo, scratching his head. (Hethought he heard the strains of "The Blue Anduin Waltz" or somethingsimilar.) "And as for you, Sam," he went on. "Why have you suddenly startedspeaking in the Northfarthing dialect again?"    "I nae longer feel I hae tae deny my heritage. In solidarity with meoppressed fellow-Northfarthingers, I defy your Hobbitonish linguistichegemony," said Sam. Frodo shrugged.    Suddenly they came across a large sign, bewritten with a mysteriousscript called teuncwar.  Fortunately there was a Westron translation, whichread: "Lugburz van Beethoven Memorial Concert Hall and Opera House -- UnderConstruction" and in smaller letters, "Morgai Construction Company." Thisreminded them again of their peril, which they had nearly forgotten in theirrelief at escaping Maglor (or Muhammad Ali, as he was called in the CommonSpeech). They might have left the University of Northern Mordor behind, butthey were nonetheless in an ominously cultured land.  Once while scoutingahead Sam came upon a baritone Orc and a mezzo practising that duet fromAct I of The Balrog of Sevîl.    "I'm nae gaein' doon there," he said to the others. "Higher up for me."    Presently, they came to an end of the classical music stuff, and foundthemselves in a new, fragrant country -- almost too fragrant.  They had leftbehind the creepily harmonious lands of Dor Remi, and had entered Ethelien,formerly the garden of Gondor in the days when the White Weed was inflower. (Mayami it had been called in the Westron tongue, a name meaning"Land of the Art Deco".) Or at any rate, it had been the garden of MinasTirith University, centre of a counterculture opposed to the anti-Sauronwars.    The hippîs, as the counterculture types had called themselves, hadwanted for the people of Gondor to gather herbs and narcotics while Sauronwas gathering armies; and face his emissaries with flowers and peace signs,and offer them hashish. Or so the Gondor historians always said; what thecounterculture types would have said for themselves, no tale tells, for theStewards ruthlessly stamped them out, while taking the drug profits untothemselves. Sauron and his servants had little truck with drugs, and hadcrushed the trade.    But in this region but shortly come under the rule of the Dark Lord,the scent of a myriad intoxicants still filled the air: opium poppies, cocaplants, various breeds of cannabis, peyote cactuses, qat, heavenly blue,black lotus, several kinds of mushrooms, and other mind-altering plants.Suddenly Sam laughed, from intoxicant-induced euphoria not for jest. Then hefrowned, for narcotics were at best a product of bourgeois decadence, and atworst an evil capitalist corruption that destroyed the communities of thepoor, and with whose ravages he was only too familiar, from the drug-addledinanities of the Gaffer. From Spiegel's gasping and choking, he guessed thatshe too smelled the vapours, and did not relish them.    "Drugses," she hissed. "Nasty, uncomfortable things! Make you late fordinner."    "Morrie would love this," muttered Frodo, who unlike the others ratherenjoyed the temporary relief from his burden - two burdens actually, whichthe mind-numbing narcotics provided. He was walking in front with Guliblenow, stopping every now and then to enjoy a specially alluring scent, or tosnack an occasional mushroom.    They had travelled halfway through Ethelien when the drugs really began totake hold of them. The day was bright and warm and they had decided to restand wait for the dusk, for Gulible would not travel under the Yellow Face,since it showed up his ugliness and jeeringly rubbed in the fact that hedidn't have a chance in Angband of winning over the lovely Spiegel. So theyhad found a deep brown bed of last year's poppies and settled there.    Frodo passed out almost immediately. The fumes helped him to forget fora time a certain self-doubt that had been growing on him since the Spiegelincident. He had had relatively few misgivings about his way of life up tonow.  It had seemed right to him that, as a wealthier member of society, heshould do what he liked and let the less fortunate go hang themselves.Poverty was probably good for them, anyway.  Builds character, and all that.Besides, Cassiopeia Took looked really good in that dress (though she lookedbetter with no dress at all ... wogah ... wogah ...) But his treatment ofSpiegel had awakened him to the true turpitude of his nature, and he wasfilled with shame and self-loathing. It was true, the Phial might had beenresponsible for the worst outrages -- but had it not, in truth, brought outand exaggerated an evil which had long lay just beneath the surface? Oh, toforget, to sleep a profound, dreamless sleep without pain or regret! Frodoinhaled deeply. Ever since their departure from Lorien, he had secretlylonged to rediscover the Nirvana he had experienced there, and now that hehad found it, it was gonna take something remarkable to get him out ofthere!    Gulible was lying cowered away from the others, but the strange andinsidious fumes that surrounded their resting-place were having an effect onhim too; the fragrance of the poppies was confounding his brain, so that hecould see nought but the image of Spiegel in various provocative postures.How could he win over - if not her heart, at least her body? Suddenly he hadan epiphany; so crystal clear that it almost blinded him. Dames didn't careabout a guy's looks, as long as he was polite and considerate towardsthem! With this drug-addled insane idea in his head, he sprang up and ranaway, returning soon with arms full of flowers.    "I picked you some bosies, Ms Spiegel," he explained, handing the flowerstowards the surprised hobbit-lass.    "Why, thank you Gulible," said Spiegel, obviously pleased. She wasn'tfeeling quite herself either, and the kind gesture of the old philandereralmost brought tears to her eyes. It seemed to Gulible that his plan wasworking perfectly.    "Well, aren't you gonna eat them?" he asked. "Look! They're full of fresh,juicy maggotses..."    Ok, that didn't work, thought Gulible, running to the woods again. Maybeif I could find some frogses, eels, crickets or - Wait! Now we know what shewould like, yesss...    Sometimes later Sam woke up from an intoxicated sleep, in which he haddreamed of his beloved Rose. Red Rosie, Revolutionary Rosie, the Rose of thePeople, Rose of Solidarity. La Rosa Internationale was her name in Rohan,Róza Luxemburg in the East; to the West she went not.    But oh, how they had marched together in the Mayday parade, and how hotshe had been later, while attacking the revisionist wing in the partycentral-committee meeting... But what was this? There was his beloved Roselying right next to him! How did she get here all of a sudden?    Sam was trying to work out this problem, when another thought popped intohis delusional brains. "How thin and drawn she looks," he muttered. HisRosie had always been a sturdy lass, with broad shoulders and strong hips, amodel of a working-class heroine if anyone. "The journey has taken a lot ooto' her it seems, and that's a fact."    Spiegel didn't wake up when Sam touched gently her cheek. "Sleep, my dear.Sleep," he muttered. "I will get ye something to eat, if it's the last thingI ever do." Then he noticed something lying in the ground, next to thesleeping hobbit. Something that looked exactly like two skinned rabbits.What a stroke of luck! thought Sam. A gift from Gulible, no doubt. Well,I shall put it in good use... He discovered an abandoned Isildur-helmetlying nearby, and using that as a pot, Sam begun to cook one of hisspecialities; stewed rabbit with herbs and mushrooms.    The Shire was not exactly known for its haute cuisine; for the hobbit'sidea of the gastronomic beau idéal emphasised quantity (mostly of meat andpotatoes, cooked to be as mushy as possible) over quality.  But Sam wasaccounted a relatively good cook, for a hobbit; although cooking a meal inthe absence of his beloved pots -- which he had dumped in the Dead Marshes,where the alligators had seized them for their orchestra -- was clearlygoing to be a tall order. Soon, however, the rabbits cut up lay simmering inthe helmet-pot. Still, something was missing though. Conveniently Guliblewas wandering about aimlessly, muttering something about being abducted byspace aliens.    "Hi, there, old snuffler!" said Sam. "Your new motto's Always ready tohelp..."    "First we've heard of it, saddam," muttered Gulible.    "Shut yer mouth and bring me some herbs and mushrooms, or shall I presentthe Fist of Death on thee! And onyway, dinnae ye want to help me get foodfor the lady?"    "Have mercy!" shrieked Gulible. "We'll do anything! Get yummy food forSpiegel. Don Giovanni swears it on the Precious!"    Spiegel? puzzled Sam momentarily, before figuring that it was probablyjust another of Revolutionary Rosie's names, and returned to his pot/helmet.Soon Gulible came back with ingredients. Only now did he get close enough tosee what Sam was up to. With a thin hissing shriek he dropped his burdenand gripped Sam by the sleeve.    "Ach! Nein - halt - raus!" he cried. "No! Evil hobbit! Steals the yummiesGulible brought for Spiegel. Saddam! Don Giovanni captured two lab-ratsfor Spiegel - one was a genius the other insane. Spiegel likes rats so muchshe faints, and now hobbit tries to take the credit. Don Giovanni won't lettreacherous hobbit steal our wogah! We'll get even, precious. We have newfriends now, good friends and very strong."    With these enigmatic words he sauntered off. Suddenly Sam felt like theworld was rolling around in his eyes as he returned to his senses. Rosie wasgone and so were the rabbits, and he realised that he was boiling tworodents on a hat which had funny round ears. His head was humming andsuddenly he collapsed to the ground and lay like a dead thing. The narcoticfumes of Ethelien had defeated him.    Through the mists of his drugged sleep, Sam could see the figures of fourtall men surrounding them. He could hear their voices, but he was unable tomove or speak, or wipe the grin off his face, for that matter.    "We have found what we have found," said one men. "But what have wefound?"    "Not Orcs," said another one. "Unless UNM has lowered their standardsremarkably."    "Elves perhaps?" said the third man, dumbfully.    "Nay! Not Elves," said the fourth, tallest and also the one with thickesthair - thereby probably the chief among them. "Elves have their own dope andneed no mannish stuff to get high, or so it is said. No, these three areHobbits or Pediannath from the north, also known as halflings, halfwits,potheads, that in Rohirric are called les Américains, and in Dwarvishdamâb (singular dumb),  or to those who speak High Language: YlenSankia Priha. They are the result of a fascinating genetic experimentundertaken by Miniwethil the mouse-eared, which explains their rodent-likefeatures and intellect. I wonder whether they have retained any traditionsconcerning the Flying Mûmaks of Dumbar, which I am trying to collect for myannotated version of the 'Dumbarcalevala' or The Adventures of Väinö - theBaad Mother..."    ("Shut your mouth!" muttered one of the men.)    "They say Mini mated with one of the Corsairs of Dumbar, so some oftheir traditions could easily have passed into hobbit-lore. Fascinating,absolutely fascinating. The text, of course, inheres within thediegetico-enacting praxis... But further discussion of this problem willhave to wait. In the meantime, let us carry these three dopeheads away fromhere to sober up!"    At the tall man's command, the three others picked the hobbits up andcarried them away from the opiatic fumes, to the banks of a small stream,and poured cold water on their heads. As Sam returned to his senses, hecould see that their captors were indeed Men, even though they were wearinggreen tights. They had masks on their faces to protect them from thedangerous fumes. All were armed, except the leader, who had instead a largemagnifying glass, with which he was examining Frodo's fingers, mumblingsomething like: "Mmmm, interesting..."    "Hey! Who are you and what are you doing with that?" cried Frodo,suddenly alarmed.    The tall fluffy-haired man laughed grimly. "I am Dr. Faramir, theScientist of Gondor," he said. "And what I do, I do to preserve themight and majesty of Ye ole Gondor, and to promote the development ofscience and arts of Humanism. Gaudeamus Igitur, and all that stuff. Or asthe Philosopher-King Earwag said: With each thing, ask what is its nature,its being... Although, of course, there have been many philosophicaldebates about what 'being' is. Dasein and Vorhandenheit, ens andesse, but if I go on much longer, a lot of me will have to go in theappendices. Personally, I find Sauron's theory of the erotics of beingfascinating, but fundamentally unsound.  What do you think?"    Frodo muttered something barely audible, but Dr. Faramir blithelycontinued his disquisition. "Quid-pro-quo. I don't have to ask your name,Mr. Frodo Baggins of the Bilbohîni, since I already know about you andthe... thing you are burdened with, but I have many other questions."    "You know about his foot-fungus!?" cried Spiegel.    "You know about the One Ring of Power, which the Council of Rivendellentrusted to me, and which Boromir tried to steal so that I had tosta... escape from him and the Fellowship, which included Aragorn the Heirof Isildur, the wannabe-King of both Gondor and Arnor® and the wielderof the Broken Sword, which is now reforged and coming to Minas® Tirithas we speak!?" cried Frodo.    "Yes," replied Faramir. "I know about the foot-fungus, since it was acover-story of last September's Shire Medical Journal, with some veryelaborating pictures, provided by S. Gamgee." Dr. Faramir said nothing aboutFrodo's reference to Boromir, although his face had taken on a strangeexpression when Frodo had uttered that name, and instead continued:    "But I must admit that I had forgotten all about the Ring of Rings, afterI had my last article concerning it published. I never thought I would getto examine it any closer. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramirto win this year's Morbel Prize for Science. Ha!" He stood up and seemed togrow larger above them as usual in these cases, and the magnifying glass inhis hand trembled with excitement. He began to sing: Some day my grant willcome...    Hobbits looked at him with astonishment. "You and your big mouth, Sam!"cried Frodo. "Stupid is as stupid does, Mom used to say and she was right.Another fine mess you have gotten us into!"    "What?" cried Sam in outrage. "It was you who blabbered the whole thingup, not me! Oh, old Gaffer used to say to me Whatever goes wrong, the Richwill always try to pin it on the proletarians, and right enough too!    "Now look here, Doctor-sir!" he said, turning to Faramir. "Dinnae you gopunishing servants because their master is but a fool. Slice him up if youhave to, but let us go, u-heer!"    Suddenly Dr. Faramir seemed to regain control of himself  and began tolaugh quietly. "Don't worry Sam. None of you has anything to fear from me.Science may be my passion, but I still have my ethics - although I doexperiments with lab-rats, and to pay for my studies I sell drugs inco-operation with a vile gangster known as the 'Voice', but that's anotherthing entirely."    "You sell drugs!" cried both Sam and Spiegel in unison.    "Only to Orcs and other such worthless creatures, I assure you,"answered Dr. Faramir. "Demoralisation of the Enemy has always been a partof the Gondorian Defence Strategy."    "But this is all wrong!" cried Spiegel, horrified. "We can't try todemoralize the Orcs.  Shouldn't we get to know them and try to be friendswith them instead? There is still good in them, I have felt it! Besides,they're sooo sexy! One as learned as you should know better. How can youjustify this?"    Dr. Faramir gave them a somewhat pained look, before answering: "Thereare other reasons too. As I said, the funding of all science has faced someserious budget-cuts, and when the 'Voice' came to me with a plan which wouldalso provide quite remarkable profits to my university, I really had nochoice but to accept. It's a bad business, and one unworthy of my rank, butas Aruman pointed out in The Ethics of Necessity: 'When faced with anabsence of choice, choice becomes non-choice.'"    "Who is this 'Voice' that you speak of?" asked Frodo, who thought hisservants were getting a bit too impudent, while criticising the doings ofthe upper classes.    "He will not tell us his name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,"said Dr. Faramir. "But his singing fills us all with dread. At first Ithought he was another friend of sciences, but lately I've begun to havedoubts about his motives and purposes..."    Dr. Faramir looked thoughtfully into the distance. "You have given mea lot to think of, you strange wanderers from a distant country," hecontinued. "This encounter may yet be proven useful for both of us, for Iknow much about the Rings effects on psyche, and may be able to help you,Frodo. But not now. We have business in hand. For your own safety and mine,I will leave two guards to guard you. You also need these face-masks if youwant to avoid another hallucinatory episode. We will talk more when Ireturn. If I return, that is - but I feel that I know now what I must do."    "Break a leg!" wished Sam and waved his hand.    The Hobbits sat down again, and watched the two men on guard settlingclose by. Speaking in pig-latin they discussed briefly what had becomeof Gulible, but found no answer to that. After a while Sam spoke to theguards, wanting to find out if they could be recruited to the cause ofRevolution; but they were slow and intellectually beyond such great visions.They named themselves Blacklung and Ramrod, members of Gondor's NationalGuard, and this crud was not what they had enlisted for.    "We don't usually come this far on the East-side," said Blacklung."Business has been slow ever since the Enemy took control of the bridgeheadin Disgiliath, and brought his accursed customs officials there. Today'stransaction is the biggest one the 'Voice' has managed to set up since then,but to make that happen we had to let some Southrons from South Central toget in on the deal. Curse them!"    "Yeah, curse the Southrons!" said Ramrod. "'Tis said that in days of yorethere were dealings with Harad, who provided labor for our sweatshops; butthere was never friendship. And now the drug-lords of South Central aretrying to get a piece of the action from our dealings to Mordor and eataway our profits. Alas! Such are these days that a white man can't even sellhis own dope from his own backyard, without the help of some raciallyinferior people. If only the King would return..."    "Aye!" said Blacklung. "But I wonder what the Doc is planning to do. Helooked like he had something in mind, I think. It sometimes seems he doesn'thave the kohones for this business, it sure does. But if he tries todouble-cross the 'Voice', there will be Udun to pay for us all."    After this there silence for a while, apart from the Ramrod's boombox;and the hobbits, finding the men's company incredibly boring, dozed off abit, before they were suddenly awakened by a sound like one of Gandalf'sfireworks gone wrong. They heard yells of "Duck!" and "Run for cover!" and"I ain't going back to jail!" A long, cinematic fight scene took place. Theair was full of bullets and loud coprologies. Suddenly a man fell face downright over the edge of the coca plants that served as their hiding-place. Hewore cut-off jeans and a T-shirt, the back of which was bewritten SauronRoolz, and he looked swarthy and racially stigmatized. His brown hand stillheld a rusty water-pistol. It was Sam's first sight of war between Men andMen, and he found it a nasty consequence of the deep structures ofinequality. He was glad he could not see the man's face. He wondered if hewas really evil at heart, or just a victim of societal exploitation or theproduct of a broken home, whether the presence of a positive male role-modelwould have enabled him to avoid this fate -- all in a flash of thought thatwas suddenly driven from his mind, when a loud noise broke out almost nextto him.    "Drive-by! Drive-by!" cried Ramrod. "May the Force or Valar or whateverturn him aside! Khaddy! Khaddy!"    To his amazement and dread, and everlasting joy, Sam saw an enormous shapecome charging through the hashish groves. As big as a house, much biggerthan a house he seemed to Sam's astonished eyes, and noxious fumes gushedforth from the hind portions of his anatomy. Fear and amazement, perhaps,made him appear larger to Sam than he really was; but the Khadillak of SouthCentral was indeed a car of great bulk, and such of his descendants as liveon in these latter days are but a shadow of his girth and majesty. It ispossible that the effects of the dope had not yet worn off, or perhapsbedazzlement had confounded Sam's vision; but he could have sworn that themonster's feet looked a lot like wheels. But he had little time to get acloser look, for in the driver's seat a man, who looked strangely familiar,was bombarding the countryside with an AK-47. Sam hit the dirt as thebullets ricocheted all around him; and within a moment the great beast waslost to view, still trumpeting his horns far away.    Sam gave a deep breath. "It was an Oliphaunt," he said. "So Oliphauntsexist, and I have seen one.  What a life! But no one at home will believeme, until the Revolution raises their consciousness.  Well, now I'm going totry to sleep off the effect of those cursed poppies. Don't wake me up!"    Blacklung laughed sarcastically. "Don't you halfwits ever do anything butsleep?"    "Not really," muttered Frodo, waking up for a split-second beforecollapsing.
     It seemed to Frodo that he had slept while long yearswere measured by the wheeling stars above them - but in truthonly a few hours passed before Dr. Faramir came back.In record time he had gathered many men who had come withhim; indeed the entire scientific establishment -- scientists,professors and student body -- of all the universities inEastern Gondor had seemed to gather for the occasion.They sat on the hill and grasses, in a huge amphitheatrewhile Dr. Faramir was pointing with a ruler at the standingfigures of Sam and Spiegel. It looked strangely like aclassroom's show-and-tell: and Frodo wondered why he waslet aside.     It soon became obvious that the students were notsatisfied with Dr. Faramir's account of the hobbits atseveral points: their migratory patterns, their reproductiverituals - not to mention their feeding habits and heightaverages.     "But it was at the waking of Isildur's shame that themidgets would be standing low!" a fellow Professor, DrImrahil, insisted. "If these are the so-called midgetsknown as les Américains, then they must be able toadjust their height, or at least do so since the householdof the round one. Do you deny it?"     "The Bourgeoisie indeed has a knack for greatly expandingtheir width at the workers' expense, and that's a fact. Butnot their height," spoke up Sam. We'll have to adjust itfor them, he thought. He had a vision of heads, many headsrolling, and then all the clouds parted and at his commandthe whole of the Shire became a garden of cut-off heads. Heonly had to pick up a handy axe...     But Dr. Imrahil interrupted his daydreaming. "There areother things I'd like to learn from you, for all thatconcern Isildur concern me closely and yet the matter ofIsildur's Shame still remains unresolved. Embarrasingthings Isildur did a-plenty, and knowledge of any one ofthem would not be a sign of doom. Whatever was that thingyou brought it before the council and there it was seenand Isildur's shame proven - is that no so? It is hiddenyou say, but is that not a feeble attempt at blackmail?"     "Well, now that you mention it..." answered Sam, but atDr. Faramir's look he quickly changed his answer: "Nay,it is not ours to reveal. The Shame does not belong toany mortal, and certainly not me or you; therefore youhave nothing to fear. If it can be claimed by anyone itis by Aragon, son of Arathon, son of Aradud, son ofArabarf leader of our Fellowship from Moira onwards.Your complaints to him."     "Why him, and not Dr. Faramir, head of the University ofGondor which Isildur's sons founded?"     "Because Aragon had a Veriseal-approved document -- oh,you mean the Shame. Because he claims to be descendantof Elendil, Isildur's son. And he has even had the swordof Elendil reforged and improved."     A murmur of scientific dismay ran through all the studentbody. "The sword of Elendil reforged and improved! Horrorof horrors! What will comes next? Should we install drainpipesin the Great Pyramid of Pelargir? Improve the frown of theMinnie Pizza? What a grievous loss to archaeology."     But Dr. Faramir interrupted now, and he seemed unmoved."Maybe. But the 'reforging' of such a sword could easilybe used as an excuse to remove all evidence of itsauthenticity. I suspect a case of fraud -- clear proofshall be required of this sword's origin should thisAragon come to Minas Tirith. We'll have to carbon-dateit before we decide whether we'll hang him for desecrationof one of our nation's artifacts -- or give him the chairfor heir-to-the-throne impersonation. Class dismissed!"     The students dispersed, and so did all the professors otherthan Dr. Faramir who seemed thoughtful. Frodo approached thegroup, and Sam stared defiantly at the man. "Well, are yousatisfied, Faramir? I did the best I could." he said in ahushed voice.     "Of course you did!" Dr. Faramir said and smiled. "Youare great at deception - of all sorts." He went on with asideways glance at Frodo which made Sam very uncomfortable."But you could not hide from them the fact that you threebear a burden other than Frodo's foot-fungus. The misdirectionwas necessary, I fear - and the revelation of the Sword willhelp cloak your other secrets.     "But there are other matters I want to learn from you now -which makes me happy that you have finally woken up, Frodo.You spoke of Boromir a little while ago. Were you a friendof his?"     Vividly before Frodo's mind the memory of Boromir(handsome rugged looks and all) bending over him with his vileattentions - or stabbing him with his mighty sword: and for amoment he hesitated. Dr Faramir's looks hardened. "No," Frodosighed, "and more's the pity."     "Then you wouldn't care at all if you learned that he wasgay?"     "Indeed I would no--" Frodo said and then his startledmind caught up with his (somewhat pointy) ears. "Gay?" he said."Do you mean that he is gay, and that he never cared to tellme? How do you know? Did I lose all chance to a potentialrelationship? Or are you now trying to trap me with afalsehood?"     "I would not snare even an orc-- oh, what the hell, ofcourse I would, and my colleagues and students also, if it wasfor a good cause. But I'm not lying now."     "But he never mentioned this to me. Why did he not offerhimself to me, not even when I was using my charms all overRivendell? Surely there must be a reason?"     "Or indeed many." said Dr. Faramir, "and ugliness not themost important."     Sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry atthis conversation. "Begging your pardon," he said, "but this hasgone on long enough! See here, Doctor! What are you drivingat? Has the Magic Kingdom of Gondor fallen so lowthat it need repeat the same joke over and over again? Noonecares about their sexual preferences, and that's a fact."     "Patience!" said Dr. Faramir. "Your wit may be a greaterthan that of your master, but you don't need to teach me aboutour peril: the death-blow of the lame joke. Were I as hasty asyou I'd have killed you all long ago - and then proceeded totorch down Minas Mickey and pretty much all the rest of theMagic Kingdom of Gondor as well."     Sam sat down heavily, and Dr. Faramir turned to Frodo again."You asked how I know these things. We kept little hidden fromone another. Similarity in names means kinship 'tis said. Andwe two had four letters in common: He was my brother."     A shadow of sorrow passed over his face and Sam and Spiegelexchanged looks (though Frodo remained oblivious as ever). "Weobserve, Doctor," Sam said, "that with great care you say wasand kept. What about the present tense? Do you think himdead?"     "Well, it certainly wasn't a mistake in grammar!" Dr.Faramir snapped at them, then he turned towards Frodo again. "Doyou remember anything of special mark that Boromir carried withhim?"     Frodo stuttered for a while, wondering how this interrogationwould turn. How he would fare among so many men, (oh my, how manymen!) warlike and strong, he did not know, and it filled him bothwith hope and fears of inadequacy. Yet he felt in his heart thatDr. Faramir at least was a man both less interested in sex andstraight.     "Boromir used to have a horn."     "Oh, that - yes, he used to drink from it, and its sound washis weapon of choice. I meant something else."     "A sword that he filed on rocks? A red shirt with big blackconcentric circles and an 'aim here' sign? Hair that turnedfrom black to blonde depending on the medium?"     "Yes, yes and yes." said Dr. Faramir, now becoming impatient."But, something else..."     Frodo thought deeper - and suddenly it came to him: the onething that was the symbol of the whole of Gondor; the onething which was both sewn into their flags and carved in theirtrees.     "I remember that Boromir had a trademark sign."     "You remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,"said Faramir. "Maybe you can see it in your mind. A capital Tfollowed by a capital M, either elevated in superscript or boundin parentheses. That trademark does the ruler and heir of therealm hold for many generations now -- and it said that there'sno fan or satirist which will not quail at its use."     "But even the mightiest corporation may succumb to anamateur humorist," said Sam. "and I fear that Boromir wasstruck down by many. Yet this does not explain how you know ofhis death."     "I sat at night by the solemn waters of Anduin in the greydark under the young pale moon, evermoving stream, near therustling sad reeds; watching the anthroporphisms in the narrative.But my mask may have been flawed or the fumes thicker than usual -for I had a vision: I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a raftfloating on the water.     "An awe fell on me, for the raft seemed to defy all physicallaw in that it should sink like a stone to the bottom of theriver - and yet not only didn't it do that, but there was a mantied upon it. And then the raft turned towards me, and started tofall apart within my reach and yet I dared not touch it, lestmy hands contaminate the sample."     "The man was Boromir, my brother, and as cranky as a newlyawakened Balrog which hasn't yet drank its morning coffee. Iknew his face, his voice, his stench. One thing only was changed -for his warhorn was different and all in golden. Boromir! Icried for we never used trademarks in familiar speech. Why isthy bronze horn golden? Hast thou discovered the secrets ofalchemy? O Boromir! But he only yelled Untie me, you daydreamingfool of a brother! and he was gone... The raft moved downwardsthe stream and Boromir cried Oh, no, not another waterfalland tumbled into the turbulent waters. And I do not doubtthat if he's still alive, then he'll have to find out a prettyfar-fetched way to explain it."     "Alas!" lied Frodo, yet his smirk could not be hidden. "That wasindeed Boromir, as I knew him. Not biblically, mind you. The GoldenWarhorn of Summoning was given to him in Lothlorien by the LadyGaladriel."     "So then you passed through the Land of Lorien! Long it has lainbeyond the knowledge of all except the most experienced golf-players -and yet I suspect it plays a role in the drug operations of the Voice,or the 'Master' as he desires us to call him. Much that was strangeabout him I've slowly began to understand. That guy is NOT anincarnation of Eru!" he said, yet they perceived not his meaning.He fell silent for a long while.     "But the tale is such," Dr. Faramir said again in the end, speakingagain softly. "that it will undoubtedly fill you with grief and fear.Almost it makes me want to let you go, out of sympathy for your loss.For unless all in your party were slain or captured, how would Orcsor servant of the Nameless find the time to tie Boromir down forsuch torment? I fear that none in your company still live.     "But even though I don't yet know for sure what happened on theNorth Marsh, you, Frodo, I'm certain about. I've not earned a degreein criminal psychology for nothing! There is something about you,Frodo, a fairy air, perhaps, not that there's anything wrong aboutthat. Yet more lies hidden (and you hide more lies) in your wordsand in your possessions than I had first thought. I should injectyou with truth serum and have you strip-searched.     "But we don't have time for that here. We must move hencewithout more delay." He sprang to his feet and called for Ramrodand Blacklung. "We'll be going to a secret place that we have. It'sa beautiful place and well worthy of a visit - even though it hasfailed as a commercial venture. In the morning I will decide whatis to be done about you."     They set out at once: Ramrod and Blacklung ahead, with Frodo,Sam and Spiegel behind. While they walked, Dr. Faramir talked to themwith an even more hushed voice than earlier.     "Earlier on I was careless and repeated what in his folly Frodorevealed - in front of my soldiers to boot! That is the reason Ihad you, Sam, turn to the matter of Aragon and Isildur's Sword -which my soldiers were also bound to have noticed more. Frodois way too frank for such a job. Or stupid."     "Would it help if I say it was all a bunch of lies?" saidFrodo.     "Hah! I do not blame you for trying to cover up for yourlack of skill and wisdom in a hard matter. Yet few would instantlyrecognize the thing that you spoke of - we of the house ofthe Stewards (Steuards that was once in the ancient tongue)have much knowledge and preserve much ancient lore that even inacademic circles it isn't found. For we reckon our line toMardil the good Steuard who built our first universityonce he found the opportunity to send King Eisner away to China.And he was the last King and had no legitimate child. Analliance between the universities and the entertainmentindustry has governed the city since that day.     "And this I remember from Boromir as a boy when we werefirst taught the laws of science and of commerce -- that it alwaysdispleased him that the heads and heirs of the noble houses oughtnow to have either a trademark or a Ph.D. 'How many years needpass for a copyright to expire?' he asked. 'Seventy years afterthe author's death or a hundred after publication, for otherplaces of more reasonable laws. But for the Magic Kingdomnot even a billion trillion years would suffice.' Does that nottell you anything?"     Frodo thought. "About Gondor's practices? Yes, indeed. ButBoromir accepted Aragon's Veriseal contract."     "I don't doubt it. He obeyed the laws even when theydispleased him. But the pinch had not yet come: Aragon had nottried to trademark yet his name or create his own copyright laws.     "But once again I stray: We in the house of Denethor knowmuch in both scientific and financial matters. Books and tablets,battery-powered lanterns and swords guaranteed to break immortalwills, microscopes and nuclear generators. Few understand thesethings nowadays - alas for the lowered standards in public education.It was these things that brought the Dirty Pilgrim to us - and yethe spoke to us about other lands in the North, so far more advancedthan ours that they even have umbrellas."     Dr. Faramir sighed and his eyes took a far-away look. "What awonder these lands must be! All things must be great there, andscientists held to a great respect!"     Sam coughed nervously. "The Dirty Pilgrim?" asked Frodo. "Did hehave a name?"     "Masterly Wonderful One he wanted us to call him, " saidDr. Faramir, "or he wouldn't be content. But many are the namesthat I have been given, and even more the epithets, he said.Mesprendeur among the elves, and Wandy-elf in the Eddas; Olorinin the West in my youth best left forgotten, Mayanus in the South(which becomes Mayonnaise in the Gnomish dialect), Gandalf in theNorth, 'That Crazy Pyromaniac' in the forests--"     "I think we get the picture." said Frodo.     "-- 'Your Finger, You Fool' in the lost kingdom of Australia,and Gandolf as the rustics name me, or 'Panoramix' in the nobletongue or Olrrn?whthfckdsthtIstrthn^kheis?! to those who canpronounce somewhat the Valinorean..."     "Olrn -what?!?"     "--thfckdsthtIstrth^nkheis?! yes. It's in the Zarfian dialect.But my real name is constantly growing, for I've lived a very longtime, and my name is a story that would tell you all the things I'vedone or are planning to do and that would really inconvenience me."     "No doubt I could add to that list." growled Frodo. "Lathspell Iname him, Swindler-and-Crook. But he'll get no chance to hear it.He was lost in Moira."     "No! Fathe--uh--teacher!"     Sam and Spiegel once again exchanged looks. "'Father'?"     "No!! I never said 'father' and you can't prove I did.Fatheuhteacher means, umm... Obnoxious one in the forgottentongue of the Etruscans. Anyway, are you sure he was so thoroughlylost that he couldn't find his way back? Perhaps a search party..."     Frodo chuckled. "Thank Eru, yes. A magic-wielding character whofalls into an abyss in an ambiguous death-scene and no recovered body?Nope, we are never seeing him again."     "I see that it's a blessing that he wasn't cut in two," saidFaramir, now in greater control of himself. "This Mesprendeur was, Inow guess, more than a meddler and cow-tipper extra-ordinaire, he wasa loremaster and scientist - and you can hardly get much more of apraise than that. Had he been among us to consult concerning thehard words of our dream, he ... well, come to think of it, he wouldhave probably interpreted it as a nonsensical Freudian delusionfilled with phallic symbolism. Or we'd have quarelled about whetherit's the midget or the standing that's supposed to be low. Aye - itseems that the journey of Boromir was doomed. Mesprendeur knewhardly anything about Isildur or the events surrounding him: Geneticswas his expertise."     Now Dr. Faramir's voice sank to a whisper. "But this conclusion I'vereached, or leaped to, or somersaulted to,  and I have postponed itfor an upcoming publication: That there's physical evidence for theIsildur-Miniwethil-Sauron triangle which so far has only been rumored.But I had not before thought that Isildur's Shame was that same thing.For none of the histories - nay, not even the parodies - ever madethat connection. Not even in Dr. Imrahil's blockbusting trilogy WasIsildur gay?, Was Isildur a transvestite? and Who's this Isildurperson anyway? was that ever implied.     "What was that Thing I can't yet be certain. Was it an engagementpresent from one to the other: a piece of jewelry perhaps?" - headded with a wry smile at the hobbits. "But other reports speakof the stain of Doom that this Thing held - the stain which could notbe unmade or washed clean, save only in the Nurnenshire lake, nearthe place where it was wrought. And this implies that it wasa piece of clothing. Either way, I can believe that Boromirwould try to steal such a thing; he was a bit into crossdressing,be it rings, dresses or horned helmets.     "But fear no more! I am not such a man - and my dressing habitsare normal. No, no, I'd refuse to wear such thing, even for the sakeof scientific experimentation."     But for the sake of the Revolution, thought Sam, how manyworse things I've been willing to do. Oh, Revolutionary Rosie, forgiveme.     "For myself," said Faramir, "I would see the White Weed smokingagain all over the courts of the kings, and the Mousy Ears return,and Minas Tirith a leader in scientific achievement andentertainment: Minas Mickey again as of old, full of vision andcreativity; beautiful and expensive like a once-in-your-lifetimeexperience with wit and real humour - not a jester-for-hire with apun or fart joke, nay not even a well-intentioned clown with baggytrousers and a ready pie to throw."     Frodo made no answer. Almost he had wielded to a lusty desirefor this man of taste and scientific achievement - but something hadheld him back. He was now in a deep mistrust about the Stone ofGaladriel (or was it the Ring - a 'thing of Power' Maglorsaid) which might create in him these feelings. It didn't helpthat right now he felt himself getting turned on by visions ofclowns throwing custard pies at him.     So they passed on, until the graphic surroundings grew fewerand fewer. Then they turned aside again to the right, and camequickly to an open field, west of a white house with a boardedfront door and a small mailbox in front of it.     "Here, as was agreed, I shall blindfold the eyes of Frodo.The others may still walk free."     This was not to the liking of Frodo. "The agreement was madewithout my consent," he said. "I will not walk blindfolded, like apeasant or a servant. I am not a spy, and if I will not go forwardfree then I will go back and sue you all when I come into myinheritance as Lord of the Nurnenshire estates."     "Now that you have so far, you can't go back to where you usedto be. You are in a whole new world." said Dr. Faramir sternly."And I am either speaking metaphorically or quoting a song.Possibly both. Anyway, you will NOT come into your inheritance,not unless you claim it within ten years' time. We could keep youfor longer than that."     Frodo sprang up (a rather meaningless gesture, since he wasalready standing) and tried to set himself side by side with Sam,something which would have caused more impressive results if Samwas willing to comply or if there had been a nearby wall to placehis back against. He fumbled for Sting.     "A plague on males and their pissing contests! We don't carewhose sword is the biggest!" cried out Spiegel.     "Come!" said Sam. "It is unfair for my poor, poor Master to bethus singled out. Blindfold us all, and me first. That will be best,even though surroundings will have to be described verbally," hesaid but he winked at Dr. Faramir as he was saying it.     "So let it be done." answered Dr. Faramir, smiling. "Will youconsent to this, Frodo? Why, I will blindfold even myself and mysoldiers before leading you onwards."     Frodo reluctantly agreed, and forcing himself not to laughDr. Faramir had Blacklung blindfold Sam, Spiegel, Faramir himselfand then Frodo. Needless to say when that last blindfold was placed,all the other ones were removed.     So it was that Frodo knew nothing of that last mile of the road.They descended through caves, and a maze of twisty little passages,all alike. Now and again they'd have to backtrack their steps oreven drop objects so as to have reference points in their effortsnot to get lost. In places the passages seemed to have a weird logicof their own, so that reversing your direction wasn't certain toreturn you to your point of origin. It all looked very tedious andtiring to Sam, even though it filled him with a strange sense ofnostalgia.     "Let Frodo... uh, I mean us see!" Dr. Faramir said in theend. Frodo's scarf was removed and he stared around him. They werestanding on a wet floor of polished stone, on which a window wasset, open, one pane laid back.     "This is the Henneth Annun, the West Under the Window,",explained Faramir. "One of the most experimental of our places.Few strangers even know about it. Don't mind the name. It'sintentional."     They climbed down and at once the found themselves in a roomwith a table set for two (two hundred that is), lit by candlelight."Well, here is our refuge," said Dr. Faramir. "Not a typical place,but here at least you may pass the night. Only two reactions there areever concerning it: One either loves or hates it. And understandingis not required for either."     Dr Faramir bid them rest, then he went about among the men,questioning each as they came in. Some were coming back fromtheir SATs, but others had been sent to record the fauna in the landsbordering with Mordor.     "Well, Anblorb, did you have a chance to study the specimen youwere seeking in its native environment? Before dissecting it, thatis?"     "Well, no, Doc," said the young man. "It didn't seem of the orcusgenus at least. But I did see something rather strange. It wasgetting dark, so perhaps it was nothing other than a grue or aNorseman."     Sam pricked up his ears at this.     "Yet if it was a grue, it was also horned. It stood man-high andseemed to walk as if it knew our secret ways. Perhaps under theshadow of the Unnamed Travesty some of the Norsemen of Holywoodare wandering in our newsgroup. They have horned helmets there,'tis said."     "Perhaps," said Dr. Faramir, hesitating briefly. "That could be aomen of both ill and good. An influx of newbies can be a good thing,but not everyone would welcome it. What did you do?"     "I followed standard procedure," said Anblorb, beaming. "Shotit dead. It screamed and then fell into the waters and flowed away."Sam gasped then, and Dr. Faramir gave him a swift glance - but Samsaid nothing. He struggled with himself. "Boromir may not be allright," he thought, "and then again he may be. I have a feelingthat he may still have a part to play before all this is over. Dr.Faramir did tell me that Boromir's Gnomish name was 'McCloud'after all."     After supper (and before they ate they had all stood silentlyfor a moment in respect for the One Who Was, and the One Who Is,and the One Who Will One Day Perhaps Be) Dr. Faramir asked themmany questions about their journey. Much he dwelt on the subjectof Tom Bombadildo, but eventually he returned to the place ofBoromir in the fellowship and the role he'd played in withthe Reeps in the wild, with the bureaucracy of Charadhras, inthe mines of Moira.     "It must have irked Boromir to flee from such an obviousplace of both entertainment and commercial profit."     "He was the last to go," said Frodo, "but the room had becomefilled with enflamed posts. If it hadn't been for that, I do notdoubt that both Aragon and Lego-lass would have remained theredebating the subject."     "Maybe it would have been better if he had perished there,rather than meet the torment that awaited him in the hands of orcs."     "Maybe! Which reminds me, how about those Nicks?" said Frodo,trying to quickly change the subject. "Umm, because the sports of MinasTirith interest me a lot, that is."     "How about them? Interest for sports is waning in Minas Tirith.The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may briefly rekindle itperhaps, if its bearer has not only inherited the blade, but alsothe will to fight for his life against the lions and tigers of thearena we'll put him in.     "Boredom was ever present in the realms that the Atlanteansfounded. Kings used to sat lazily in front of non-existent anduninvented television sets, or considered a game of scrabble moreinteresting than the process of reproduction. And the birth-rateswere declining.     "But the stewards were wiser and much more liberal in theirbeginning. Liberal because they recruited the breeding-stock of thesturdy folk of the havens, and invited the sexy peoples of the Northover, which being white were considered almost human, unlike the menof warmer climates. (And thence does Dr. Imrahil derive hisancestry - the teen pregnancy of an elven exchange-student.)     "So it came to pass in the days of Cirion, the TwelfthSteuard (and my father is the 1075th - don't ask, there were someperiods of very abrupt changes in management) that the Rohirrim mencame over and wooed our womenfolk, while the Rohirrim women tried torape our men. And these all became our brothers and sisters-in-law,and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need with sexual adviceand better cuisine.     "And even the most bigoted among us loved them, for their womenwere fair and their men were fair, and their speech was likewisefair, and a great number of the children born to our women werefair in the following years. And the bigoted among us had noproblem with that.     "For in such a way did Gondor like to divide the human species,forcing everyone to register as one of nine different 'races' based onthe hue of the skin, with the whitest us on the top. Feh!" Dr. Faramirspat on the ground. "Scientifically absurd!" he said, and then suddenlysighed and was quiet.     Sam was suddenly willing to take whatever information he hadoffered to share with them at face value. He had noted that Dr. Faramirseemed egalitarian-minded, and this had earned his respect and quietedhis suspicion even more than their mutual dislike of Frodo had. He spokeup. "You haven't told us much yet about the Ring, Doctor."     "Sam!" cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen asleep yet again, and heonly woke up for these last few words. All three turned towardshim, surprised.     "What?" he asked. "He knows about the ring. You told him yesterday,remember?"     Frodo looked embarrased. "Umm... I had forgotten, actually. Sorry."     Spiegel rolled her eyes. "Save us! There again you go! You'd forgetyour own head if it wasn't screwed on, as my grandma used to say.O dear, oh dear!"     Dr. Faramir smiled at Spiegel and then turned back to Sam. "Indeednot, Master Samwise. I thought to leave it for the next cha-- that is,for later. And I'd like to know what other people told you aboutit. Lady Galadriel, for example! Wise she must be, and perilouslybeautiful!"     Sam shrugged. "Well...I don't know anything about perilous.She may be her own evil twin sister, but she probably makes herpartners use a condom."     They spoke for a little while more and then they finally stood upto go to sleep. "I'll have thinking to do," said Dr. Faramir. "Papersto grade, and my instruments to set up for tomorrow. Go now to rest,therefore, but first tell me if you wish where you are planningto go and what do do you want?" A shadow seemed to pass overhim as he spoke those last few words, but it may have just beena trick of the candlelight's flickering.     Spiegel's eyes glowed eerily and for a moment her hair stoodon edge. "You want to know what I want? You want to know the truth?I want my people to reclaim their rightful place in Middle-Earth.I want everything to be as they used to be!" she growled, thenshe suddenly stood straight and passed her hand over her eyes."Oops. Sorry. It seems I was channelling for a moment there. Idon't even know where that stuff came from."     Sam wanted many things, several of which had to do with theblissful swing of an axe, but he refrained to speak of this beforeso many witnesses.     And as for Frodo, he suddenly burst into tears. "I just want toget my estates and title!" he whined in a weak voice. "But that blastedEl Rond forced me to first find Mount Viagra and throw the Ringinto the gulf of Freud. They all said so. Why does no one care tohelp me?"     Dr. Faramir stared at him in grave astonishment, then as Frodoswayed, he stepped back and let Frodo fall into the muddy floor."Throw the ring into Mount Viagra? What an amazingly stupid thing todo," he thought, and directed servants to pick up Frodo and throw himinto a spare dungeon.     For Sam and Spiegel better accomodations would be found. "Goodnight, Doctor. You are enjoying this, aren't you?" he asked, indicatingthe unconscious Frodo being carried away.     "Am I?"     "Yes, sir, and I don't blame you."     Faramir smiled. "Perhaps. Your begin to see with eyes keener thanthose of many who would deem themselves wise. My ethics can indeedget a bit weaker when dealing with the foolish. The desire to do as Idid was overpowering."     "Ah, well." said Sam. "As I said, I don't blame you. Butsomething else..." he added and his mouth turned into a strange smile."You said my master has a fairy air and that was true even if soundingvaguely homophobic. But I can say this: You have an air (and a nose,and eyes actually), that reminds of, of - well, a wizard. OfGandalf."     "No, you are mistaken, it's a trick of a light, it is!" criedout Faramir. "Have I not earnestly studied the matter? Wizards can'treproduce. And there's no evidence that Gandalf learned ways toexperiment with genetics in Dol Guldur, none whatsover, none I tellyou! Evil cannot create! Not that Gandalf was evil! Goodnight!"     He ran away in an uncharacteristic near-panic and Sam was leftwith his thoughts. "Well, Doctor seems a decent equal-minded sort andGandalf is dead, but there's nothing wrong with gathering a little dirton people... Just in case. Perhaps I can from afar discern theopportunity for blackmail." he mused, pleased with himself.     The window shattered.
        Frodo woke to find Dr Faramir bending over him. For a second a ray ofhope seized him, and he felt his stomach muscles contracting.        "There is nothing to be happy for," said Dr Faramir. "I definitelyfeel nothing for you."        Frodo's hopes vanished.        "Wake up, you fool," said Dr Faramir and hit him in the back witha rubber stethoscope. "Sam, your entrusted servant, thinks that youshould have your part in the deeds that will follow. I would have gladlylet you rot in this spare dungeon in the depths of our beloved University,but Sam convinced me that you could make for an interesting experimentalsubject. Move!"        Frodo searched for his trusted sword, but that must have beenremoved from him while he was asleep. It seemed to him also that the dungeonhad been redecorated slightly while he slept, and now had mood-lighting,a plush purple throw-rug and garish upholstery. But Dr Faramir remainedstanding impassive before him, and two of his lab-assistants stood near thedoor with great cattle-prods. Taking the hint Frodo walked quietly to thedoor, taking pains not to make any sudden movements. He was thankful to Samfor having the idea of getting him out of that stinky (was that patchoulioil?) basement Faramir was pompously caling his "dungeon".        They climbed through anonymous corridors, lighted here and there byold blacklight bulbs. In the end they reached something that looked liked aclosed balcony, suspended over a large hall. Some of Dr Faramir's men werestationed along the walls, looking out through narrow embrasures at somesight outside. Bad mood music (reminiscent of the mighty wails of theElven-queen Janis, yet canned and distilled like something meant forold men in a seedy public-house) was playing from some unknown source, andmulticoloured posters trumpeted the achievements of the doors and somesort of airplane. Dr Faramir stood beneath a mirror-ball and the starsof Gondor wheeled and spun above his head.        "Tonight, Lieutenant, we have a mystery to solve," he saidmelodramatically.        Frodo went to one of the embrasures and peered out. Outside weregrey peaks in a rough semicircle, which Frodo thought were the peaks of theEthel Duwap until he saw they were made of broken concrete. Some old PeterMax posters had once been affixed to the broken walls in a pathetic andunsuccessful effort to make the space look friendly. Their peeling edges nowshone faintly green and grey from accumulated mildew. Frodo thought he couldsee the moon over Gondor peeking over one of the cracked walls; yet it wasonly the glare of an old quartz/halogen light, such as were fashionedby the Velour in the early days of Arda when work-lights were scarce, andFrodo was simply too uninterested to make the distinction.        Far below, in a rough concrete pool, dirty water was swirling menacingly.        "What is she, Anblorb?" asked Dr Faramir to a man standing in a higher position, looking down with a spyglass. "Is she a bimbo, as we have not seen in years? Is she one of those feminist activists we ushered out decades ago? Is she a female at all?"        "'Tis not a bimbo, whatever else it be," answered Anblorb. "It hasicky feet and dives manwise. Not that it show too much skill, though; in factit is quite inept." And he grinned. "I think she is unaware of our presence. Ihave a bow here - " here he grinned and pointed towards a huge, menacing siege-crossbow mounted on a nearby trolley - "and I have other men with similar weaponsof mass destruction posted around the entrances. We are just waiting for yourorder to proceed, Doctor. One word from you and we can unleash enough weaponryto completely obliterate our own fortress." And he grinned again.        Frodo wondered what were they talking about. He looked down again butcould see nothing. Looking again from a different embrasure, however, he saw askinny body moving slowly by the pool's edge. The thing, wrapped in an old towel,was cautiously trying the cold water in the pool with one long toe.        "Should we fire our shots at her?" asked Dr Faramir, looking at Frodo."It is for you to decide. I am pursuing a psychological experiment here and, yes,you are a part of it. Feel free to decide. You have grown thinking each human being is different and that we all should be treated with the respect that isshown to a unique being-"        "I never once thought anything of the kind," Frodo snapped, insulted bysuch a plebian attitude.        "Anyway, what is it?" Dr Faramir continued. "Is it a spy, or a snack, orsome new species of crustachean? Is it a female? Would it be interested in goingto the prom? I've got a tuxedo," he preened proudly. To Frodo's eyes Dr Faramirseemed younger than before, much younger, and his hair seemed slicked back in astrange new manner. "But if she won't go to the prom with me," he continuedangrily, "I'll blow the entire fortress right out the bottom of our Flat Earth!It'll be China Syndrome right through the back of the turtle! I've had enough andI'm not going to take any more!-"        "I'd go to the Prom with you," Frodo said hopefully.        "Ask her!" Dr Faramir continued, unhearing. "Ask her! If she says yea,I'll buy you a soda, or something. If she says nay, however..." Here the Doc-tor's countenance grew fierce. His skin turned red and the Brylcreem on top ofhis head began to smoke. Horns began showing from the top of his head. "If shesays nay, then I'll blow this entire soliloquy apart! Bang go the bandagesand the trestles! There'll be a smoking hole left where the high school used tobe! My wrath shall be one with the Way of the Albatross!" Frodo looked at DrFaramir's wild eyes and foaming mouth and stepped back in amaze.        "Go!" Faramir continued. "Ask her. But if you dare return without herankle-bracelet, the very fires of Doom shall be unleashed upon you, upon her,upon us all! Go! And spare not the '55 Chevy, which my ancestors held in greatesteem in days of old. Go!"        Anblorb grabbed the small hobbit and, holding him by the neck like acat, moved quickly along a dark passage. In time and after much stumbling theyreached an airlock, inexplicably marked NO SNORKELS, where the vicious guardthrew Frodo in through the first door, slammed it and spun the wheel. Frodocould hear water splashing outside the door opposite. A man dressed in anacademic's robe was hidden in the dark, trembling of cold. When he saw Frodohis grim face changed to a hopeful one, but after getting a better look at thehobbit he went grim once more and returned into the dark corner. Frodo stooddumbly for a long moment until the academic reemerged, pointedly gestured atthe wheel in the second door, and again withdrew. Finally Frodo took thewheel - it seemed icy and menacing to the touch - and gave it a good spin; andthen another spin, and still another. It felt good. He could have spun thewheel in his hands all day.        Just as Frodo was beginning to really enjoy it, though, the wheelsuddenly stopped with a disheartening splglunk and the airlock doorslowly creaked open on its hinges - loud, squeaking, portentious melodramatichinges. With a sigh of disappointment (and a curious guilty feeling that he had,somehow, already failed, and a suspicion he was being laughed at), Frodo wentthrough the airlock and crawled down the long narrow tunnel leading down intothe cave.        Frodo looked around. There were only the gray walls all around, and therush of water from some great fissure above into the pool before him. The posterson the walls looked even worse when viewed more closely. Nothing indicated thepresence of the observation room suspended above, beyond the southwest wall.        He crawled towards the edge of the pool. At first he could not hearanything above the rush of the falling water, but as his ears adjusted he wasable to notice words near the water's edge.        "Ssssss! Ayyyy. Hushhh. Darn cold water! How is poor Gulibbl supposedto eat fishess and prawnss? No romantic dinner with poor Spiegel, noo, noteven the candles stay lit in this misst. Not likely to get a table in thiss,even with a reservation. Ssssss! Tricksy hobbits, they woo Spiegel, theyinsults her, yes, insults her, with their bad-tempered remarks and bourgeoisiestandards, and Gullible never getss her away for ten minutes, no, not evenfor a quick tryst-"        "Gulible," Frodo said quietly.        Gulible stood abrubtly, dropping a handful of lace doilies. They felldirectly into the water. "Sssss!" the creature hissed. "Baggins! Filthybastard! All day I've been working on those."        "Gullible," Frodo said again, trying an alternate spelling. "You mustlisten to me. You're in terrible danger."        "Ssstupid part to be cast in. Talks to my agent, I will," Gulible spat.        "You're in terrible danger," Frodo needlessly repeated, hoping toavoid a non sequitir reply this time. "Dr Faramir's watching us. He'sgoing to blow up the whole world and kill us all unless we appease him!"        "Mother," Gulible said inexplicably.        Frodo reeled. The single word stung him like a knife. He felt himselfsinking, sinking into a quagmire of itchy coddling. I never knew my mother,Frodo thought to himself. Though I heard rumours. They said it was a boatingaccident. They said Bilbo had an alibi. They said she was a party animal. Theysaid I'd never amount to anything. They said I had a small member. Well, I'llshow them. He turned on Gulible. "It's a lie!" he shouted. "I've always beenvery proud of my body!"        "Mother," Gulible muttered again. "She always liked me better. Anyonewho could wear pants. And now you want to get anything that isn't her, jusst toshow her. You basstard! This whole conversation is simply fraught with meta-phorical significance."        "I don't understand," Frodo said plaintively, echoing the sentiments ofmost of the readers.        At this Gulible turned away. Frodo imagined himself climbing a longpole, or maybe a trout, which was equally insensible but served to get him outof this odd state of literary symbolism he had found himself in. He hardenedhis will, took a deep breath, and stepped towards Gulible with colddetermination in his eyes. "Gulible," he ordered, "put on that dress."        "Ssssss?" Gulible hissed eloquently.        Frodo pointed. A rack full of dresses were just off to one side. "Puton that dress," he commanded, his hand reaching for the Ring. "That one. Thewhite cotton top and red plaid skirt. And the shoes and bobbysox. Be quick!Faramir wants to dance!"        Gulible seemed utterly confused, not least of all by the rack ofdresses. "Bobbobbysssocksess?" he hissed. "Sssss! Noooo! They hurts thefeet! Itches, itchessss! Nasssty Elven sox!"        "Yes, the sox," Frodo commanded, feeling the command of the Ring athis beck. "And the ankle bracelet. And the charms. I hear Dr Faramir's gota '55 Chevy."        "Ssssss. Oh. Well, that makes it all different," Gulible said quietly,reaching for the skirt. Maybe there would be a drive-in, or a milkshake. Thepathetic creature surveyed the dress-rack for a moment. "What about underwear?"Gulible asked, rooting about for a pair.        "You probably won't need any," Frodo replied.        After a time Frodo took Gulible's hand, and he led the period-costumedgangrel creature back through the double doors and into the observation room."Well, here she is," he said to Dr Faramir, proferring Gulible's slimy littlehand to him. "But no parking lots, and be sure to have her back beforemidnight."        "My dear Frodo! You did it!" Dr Faramir shouted.        And then suddenly the lights came up, and Frodo realized the room wasfilled with people. They cheered him and wrung his hand. Gulible was shovedrudely out of the way as a thing of no consequence. Dr Faramir strode up tohim and began speaking loudly. "I knew you would pass the test," he grinned."I just knew you had it in you. And now all of Gondor is here to receiveyour commands."        "My - my commands?" Frodo gasped.        "Yes, my Lord," Faramir fawned. "Even for the ruling classes of Gondor,before one can come into power one must pass the great Test of Leadership®. Soit has been for untold generations of our people. And by commanding this uglylittle creature to do your bidding - " he gestured quickly over towards Gulible,who was sitting in a chair kicking his heels and looking put-upon - "you havepassed our Test®, and become the Ruler of our great people. Nay, even aYardstick! Praise Him With Great Praise!"        And all the host cheered and threw confetti and water balloons, andFrodo looked out at the awestruck unwashed masses and realized deep in hisheart that he really was meant by Divine Providence to lead them all;and the feeling was powerful and strangely erotic.        Just then the crowd parted and Sauron came forth - Sauron, the EvilOne, with three heads and only one Eye, five hands and only nine fingers, anda three-piece suit with only one tie - Sauron came in and bowed before him."I hereby abjure of all my Evil Deeds," he said slowly, "and I really feel badabout everything. I am your love-slave. You can keep the Ring if you want. Idon't need it any more."        "Uh, thanks," Frodo said, then answered more expansively. "Fill out anemployment application and take a number. Have some hors d'ouevres; they'reon the little table back there."        Sauron slunk away, and Gandalf stepped in to fill the void. "Frodo,my lad!" he grinned. "About time you made it here. I sent a Candygram off tothe Lords of the West. They should be here in an hour or so to bow beforeyou, if the lights aren't against them. Excellent job, Frodo m'lad! Excellentjob."        "You can go back to cleaning latrines now," Frodo said dismissively.        "Right, I was just getting back to that," Gandalf replied. He hastenedout of the way just as Dr Faramir hustled back in, along with Boromir and agiant rat. Frodo began to panic just as Boromir spoke.        "Nay! Nay, mighty Frodo, do not be alarmed; for I am here as yourvassal, and acknowledge that you have always had the right to slay me or treatme as you will. I seek not revenge. For that is not my purpose here, nor ofanything but to this purpose: You are now to be Mighty Lord of Gondor,and now we shall have your Coronation!"        Frodo felt an almost orgasmic buildup of happiness and power. WithFaramir kneeling on one side of his chair and Boromir upon the other, heimagined his life as it was to be henceforward: kingly, and royal, and holdingall of the Western lands beneath his mighty fist. And with these two mightyvirile men at either hand, eager to obey his every whim! Behind him the giantsix-foot smiling Rat lifted up the Mouse-ears, the symbols of Kingly Might inGondor, and slowly, gently placed them upon Frodo's kingly and noble head.        Frodo smiled beneficently upon the crowds, then glanced for a briefmoment at his twin vassals before looking up for the champagne - then did adouble-take as he saw the braziers full of red-hot coals. "Uh, what the hell arethese for?" he snapped, partly irritated and partly scared.        "The rivets," Boromir replied. "To hold the Crown on your magnificenthead. Forever."        Frodo opened his mouth to object, but just then there was a searingburning sensation from his right temple! The first rivet was in! He began tocry out when the Rat hit the rivet with a hammer, a ball-peen hammer whichreverberated in Frodo's skull! Before he could object the second and thirdrivets were placed, and though he tried to scream the Rat smilingly went onwith its work, pounding, pounding, pounding, the mouse-ears welded toFrodo's head, with no chance of escape...
  Much to his surprise, Frodo found himself sitting on the cave in hisbedplace. Quickly he felt on his head and sighed with relief. The mouse-earswere gone. Thank Eru, it was all a dream. He looked around and noticed Samand Spiegel sleeping peacefully nearby. Either that or the whole thingneeded some serious rewriting, he decided and returned to the realms ofIrmo. Soon, however, the hobbits were woken up, and led to a table where foodwas set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them, and there was someconfusion of who was to be left without a seat until Frodo got the messagethat his presence was not desired and returned to his bed.  When they had finished, they stood up. "A word of warning for you two,"said Dr Faramir. "Beware Frodo son of Bilbo. He has done murder-death-killbefore, or at least tried to; and his uncontrollable urges may lead you intothe world of trouble yet."  "Yet we must go with him, at least for a while," replied Sam. "Because ofthe agreement we have made. He's still the boss, or so he must think, untilthe time is right. And he wants to go to Mordor."  "Then you must go right now," said Dr Faramir. "The land is empty ofdrug-dealers, and the 'Voice' is hiding somewhere, licking his wounds. Butmy scouts who have crept within sight of Morannon bring strange news. Allis quiet in the nameless land. The choir-practices have ceased, and theclass-trips have been cancelled. A waiting silence broods there, and I knownot what this portends. Perhaps Sauron is planning nothing more but anotherwalking-concert, and yet I fear that the time of some great conclusion drawsnear. For it is only Gondor which stands between him and the greatRenaissance of Middle-Earth, and if she falls, then light entertainment maycompletely disappear from the western lands."  Before seeing them off, Dr Faramir gave the hobbits some provisions. "TheMordorians have weird tastes in cuisine," he said, "and I am stronglyopposed to experimentation in an uncontrolled setting. In addition, I wouldgive you these gifts."  To Sam he gave a small laboratory kit and a lab-book, that he mightcontinue experimenting on Frodo during their journey.  To Spiegel he gave abottle of medicine to help her controlling her channelling problem, and toFrodo a copy of Playtark, that he might behold the beautiful blondestherein, and be cured.  (Actually, Frodo was already beginning to changesexual identities again. The good news is that he had the hots for femalesagain. The bad news is that these females were mostly fishes.)  "I can nay offer you any more help," he said to Frodo. "Unless you arewilling to come with me to Minas Tirith, where we have the bestlab-equipment money can buy. Then I could also examine your foot-fungus, andperhaps develop a powerful biological weapon to use against the Enemy out ofit. Won't you come?"  Frodo felt tempted to surrender himself completely to the skilful hands ofthis grave young doctor, whose words seemed so wise and fair. But he washeld back, by his dreams of the great catfishes, which he had heard livingin the muddy banks of the lake Nurnenshire - wogah, wogah! He lifted hishead and noticed how the others were looking at him strangely, and realisedthat he had spoken his inner monologue out loud.  There was no need for more words. Frodo was again blindfolded and DrFaramir took them to the edge of the forest. He bid farewell to Sam andSpiegel, after the manner of his people, and then disappeared into the woodswith winged speed, leaving the two hobbits spitting and wiping their mouths.Frodo removed his blindfold with haste, and stood blinking his eyes in themorning sun, gazing around and looking a bit silly.  "Is it secret? Is it safe?" he screamed out.  "What on Arda are you talking about?" asked Sam. "The Ring sure as Udunisn't a secret, 'cause you spilled your guts about it the first chance yougot!"  "No I didn't!" said Frodo.  "You so did too!" said Sam. "Lucky thing you didn't get a chance toreveal that you also have Isildur's Shame in your possessions. Now let'smove on!"  Then there was lots of marching...  Presently they came to a crowded intersection, which had been closed offfrom traffic.  An enormous sign said "Google Junction"; for they were cometo a strip that Google (also called The Evil One) had seized from Sauron inexchange for paying off his debts.  He had proceeded to develop it in recordtime, until it resembled Rockville Pike, without the local colour.  Most ofthe inhabitants were tourists who gave a new meaning to the phrase "UglyGondorian". A small, decrepit figure was making a vain attempt toproposition all the females. On noticing the hobbits, he gave a start ofrecognition.  "Spiegel, my preciousssss!" he hissed. "Are you still with the nasty meanhobbits?"  "Yes, though my heart yearns to once again see the familiar pillars on thedoors of Tara, where my roots are. After all, tomorrow is another day!"replied Spiegel and quickly took a zip from the medicine-bottle given by DrFaramir.  "Have no fear! Don Giovanni'll protect you, yes he will," promised Gulible(for he it was).  "And where have you been all this time?" interrupted Sam. "Plotting somenasty and unnecessary sub-plots, no doubt!" Sam took a quick look at Frodoto see what he thought about the obviously guilty face Gulible was making,but Frodo seemed to be deep in thoughts.  Now that they had reached the crossroads, Frodo felt that he had came tothe point of no return. Once again he felt a strong urge to drop everythingand head straight to Gondor. He thought about long hours alone with DrFaramir, being examined by his strong, yet tender hands, and felt hisexcitement arousing. Then he thought of the slimy fishes of lake Nurnenshireand felt even more aroused. "You're tearing me apart!" he cried in hisdespair.  "I need a drink!" said Sam.  The hobbits went into a bar and ordered some expensive lutefizz (a localbeverage -- don't ask) and proceeded to get roaring drunk. Sam had rarelymade such an impassioned revolutionary speech in his life. Unfortunately, noone could remember any of it thereafter. The next thing they knew, they werehandcuffed and were being held by Google's private security guards.  "We're gonna take you to Gondor to stand trial," said one. "But firstya gotta come with us to the concert, cuz that's where we're going so youare too."  "Its a fair cop," said Sam.  They crossed the street and found themselves in a kind of outdoor concerthall thingy. However annoyed at being stuck with these scuzzy securityguards, they could at least take consolation at being in the FIRST ROW.First row, imagine that! But when the musicians came out, Sam and Frodowere shocked to their cohones.  "Holy Plutocracy, its the Nazdaq!" whispered Frodo, lifting his cuffedhands to cover his face. "This is the end of the road, the end of the road!"The crowd roared its enthusiasm as the nine caballeros sang an eldritchchant:        Hey, hey, we're the Nazdaq;        people say we nazdaq around,        but we're too busy huntin'        and chasiin' all the gals in Khand.        We're just tryin' to be deadly,        come and watch us ambuscade;        we're the wraith generation,        and we can't wait to get laid.  They missed the rest, because one of the security guards was munchingdoritos rather loudly and sloppily, and the crumbs were getting all overSpiegel.  At last she could stand no more and slapped the bastard in themazoolah. In the ensuing confusion the hobbits slipped away, running asif the horror that impelled their being were indeed the west wind madevisible -- or something along those lines.  Presently (sigh) they found themselves in a plaza, at the centre of whichthere stood a statue, redolent of ye olde Gondor. Tall was he, and hewore a yellow shirt and a black vest, and long, pointed shoes. His head hadbeen knocked off and replaced by an Orkish head with wacky hair; but hisbearing was still regal. Beneath his feet was carven the name "Wupdidu",which was crossed out and replaced with "Moe Zart". Nearby lay his head,which was long-nosed with a black round thingy at the end; half-closed werehis eyes, long his ears, and tall his blue black-banded hat, adorned withtwo lumps on top.  Sam muttered something about oppressors; but his heart misgave him, for hefelt some strange bond with the droopy-eared king. Frodo was disdainful:"Good riddance to bad rubbish! Those kings were overrated anyway." Spiegelsaw in the king's long snout a symbol of phallic oppression, and Guliblekept his political opinions to himself, if he had any.  If only had there been a suitable beam of sunlight shining on thedecapitated head Frodo could have possibly found encouragement from thesight, but there was no such luck.
  Sam looked at Frodo's dejected back. He saw that the situation called forextreme remedies. Nimbly, he removed a little bottle from the lab kit givenhim by Dr Faramir. With the ease of an experienced cook and master poisoner,he made a ham sandwich and let some drops from the bottle fall on it.  "Oh, Master Frodo!" he called. "Here's a little morsel to put you in abetter mood."  Frodo stared suspiciously at the sandwich. Then, as the magic of thesandwich worked upon him, his face changed and he wolfed it down as if hehad not seen any food for days.  "What are you doing?" murmured Spiegel in Sam's ear. He gave a her acrooked grin.  "That cordial on the sandwich will give our little weakling somewell-needed energy," he said. "He'll just fly the rest of the way, andthat's a fact!"  Spiegel opened her eyes very wide and stared at Frodo. "I believe you,"she choked. Sam followed her gaze and cried out. Frodo seemed to be swayingwith the wind where he stood. His feet left the ground, and he began to movein little circles, like a stray balloon. At the very moment when Sam, with ahoarse cry, leapt to pin him to the ground, he left it for good and sailedskywards with a hissing, very balloon-like sound. He gazed down at Sam andSpiegel with eyes the size of beef tomatoes before a cold wind came from theeast and blew him in the wrong direction - towards the Great River.  As Frodo scudded westwards, Sam and Spiegel sprinted after him so as notto lose sight of him. The grotesque spectacle went on for hours: Frodojerking and bobbing in the wind and the other two running after him,stumbling and cursing. Sam's language reached positively Trotskyite levelsof vituperation. The sun was already nearing the horizon when Frodo floatedinto the ancient ruined city of Disgiliath, followed by his wheezing,panting attendants. There the magical potion, satisfied with its work, letgo of him with a loud bang and he dropped to the ground, rolled over and laystill. Sam and Spiegel ran up to him, panting, and lay down on top of him.  Frodo never knew how long it was before he woke up from an evil dream andfound that reality was worse. Sam lay straight across his chest, making ithard for him to breathe, and on top of that, one of his hairy feet waspressed against Frodo's mouth. This was not the kind of kinky sex heliked! (Besides, his ichtyoerotic personality change was still progressing;even in his half-stifled condition, his loins ached with lust for big, slimyfish to straddle.)  "Sam, you addle-pated fool, get off me!" he cried.  "Oho, THAT's a new tune from you!" growled Sam, but obliged. He andSpiegel got to their feet and studied the surroundings.  They were in the centre of the old commercial district of Disgiliath. Shopwindows and malls were all around them. In the centre of the square whereFrodo had fallen down, there was a statue of a strange being with huge roundears, an insane grin, fourfingered hands in white gloves and red shorts withbig yellow buttons. But the vulgarity of the men from Westernesse had beenaugmented by the vulgarity of the Men from the East. Everywhere around themthere was evidence of their dread presence: the stench of filthy tennisshoes from an uncovered pit, the inscription MARMADÚKH IS A WANKER scrawledon a wall, an old school tie twisted like a rope around the throat of thestatue with the big round ears and a whole row of punting-boats tied to thejetty on the nearby River.  Frodo sat up. Staggering, he got to his feet. He took a few steps, pickedup a loose paving stone and sent it crashing through the window of a shopnearby.  "Master Frodo, art thee mazed?" cried Sam, shocked out of his class-conscious diction straight back to the forelock-tugging language of hisancestors.  "No, you idiot," grunted Frodo and reeled into the shop. Sam looked closerat it and realized that it was a drink shop. They heard a clinking soundfrom inside, and then Frodo returned, carrying eight bottles of WestfarthingChinook.  "They are still well-stocked after all these years," he puffed as he sankto the ground. With a greedy gleam in his eyes, he stowed seven of thebottles into his knapsack before opening the last and taking a deep swig.  "Is this really the right moment to get drunk?" inquired Spiegel icily.  "Yes," replied Frodo simply. Since there was not really much one could sayto that Sam and Spiegel fell silent, watching how Frodo knocked them backuntil the booze made him talkative.  "Do you see that other shop?" he asked, nodding to indicate the object ofhis conversation. They looked at a little shop with a bow window and a signabove which announced, in faded gold letters: "Aruman's Tattoo Parlour".  "Aruman was not always evil," hiccoughed Frodo. "My fa... Bilbo told methat he began his career as an honest shopkeeper. He did piercing as well astattooing, and the cowboys from the Pelennor Fields used to go there to gettheir hats surgically removed."  "Interesting," remarked Spiegel. "I have thought of getting my nosepierced, but I'm so fat it would simply make me look even more like a cow."  "It's bulls that have rings in their noses, you twit," sneered Frodohaughtily. Sam bristled.  "Who are you to speak to her like that, Stinky?" he demanded. Frodo gapedstupidly at him and emitted a loud burp. Menacingly, Sam took a stepforward. However, at that very moment there was the sound of someonestrumming a guitar behind them, and then a well-known voice burst intodreaded song:          I'm an Elven bard and I'm OK,          I sing all night and I sleep all day.They all looked at Maglor's detested figure. Frodo, who seemed to sober upconsiderably at the sight, muttered in the high-elven speech: "A galaxy wentout on the hour of our meeting."  Undeterred, Maglor threw back his head and sang:          I sang of beer, of lots of beer, and lots of beer there flowed:          Of peanuts and of pretzel bags, and boy, the goodies showed.          We drank a toast, a second toast, the foam was on our ale,          and some took bitter, others stout, and one or two chose pale.          And there beyond the counter stood a barmaid plump and fair;          The glow from our reefers shone like torches in her hair.          Oh, Ivy Bush! Beloved pub! When will we meet again,          When will I gaze with love again at every beery stain?          Oh, Ivy Bush! Too long I dwelt upon this Hither Shore          And drank inferior brands of ale and stared upon the floor.          But even travelling steerage I could not escape my curse:          Where are the tickets cheap enough to suit my meagre purse?There was silence. No one wanted to applaud for fear of encouraging Maglor.With feigned absent-mindedness, Frodo stared at the River. Suddenly, hearose with a cry.  "Beloved! Precious!" he shouted. He started to run towards the River. Witha curse Sam tried to grab his arm and stop him, but was too late.  In the River, a beautiful mermaid yoohooed at Frodo, stroking her hair andmerrily slapping her fishtail against the water. Frodo was filled witherotic madness. THIS was what he always had desired! He took a flying leapinto the water and began to swim towards her with great strokes of his arms.  "Come back, Master Frodo!" screamed Sam. In an attempt to turn him back tohis old fixations, he whined: "Oh Frodo, me dear, me dear! Come back!" butto no avail.  "STOP him!" howled Spiegel.  "OK," sad Maglor. He stooped, grabbed a cobble-stone and threw it atFrodo's head, scoring a bull's eye. With a last, despairing precious he sankbeneath the waves.  The mermaid stared at them with big, frightened eyes. Sam looked at Maglorwith disgust.  "Brilliant!" he commented. "Any other great ideas?"
       Twilight began to fall like a really slow boulder.  Sam sat onthe cobblestones outside the Siege Weapons Of The Future display,smoking his pipe and idly looking in the windows at a greasy, obsoleteprototype of the Trebuchet of Tomorrow.  Spiegel leaned against thewall nearby, staring blankly at the red of the setting sun.  Maglor,who had been mistuning his guitar for a horrifying quarter hour, wastrying to unbend a fret he had bent in a particulary unsuccessfulGb7 chord.       When they had run down to the riverbanks the mermaid, who uponcloser inspection turned out to be a suckerfish with two prominentgills, had squeaked in terror and swam off to have another go atevolution elsewhere.  No sign of Frodo could be found.  Sam didsucceed in recovering Frodo's waterlogged pack.  It still held theirprovisions, their beer-money, some grotesque silicone-rubber toyswhich Sam dared not identify, and a small assortment of stolen cutleryfrom Dr Faramir's caves.  Yet no sign of the Ring or of the waterproofpacket which held the Deed to Nurnenshire could be found.       No sign of the Shiny Thing of Galadriel could be found either."That bastard!" Maglor had shouted at the water, hitting the riverangrily with his guitar.  "That drooler!  That cat-loving thief!"After an hour or so he calmed down somewhat and dealt with his griefby writing a song.  To the horror of the hobbits he insisted onsinging it all afternoon over and over:       Are you going to drown under there       Pervert thief hairfooted and short       I don't see how I'll find the slipca-ast       Hobbit was my final resortLate in the day Maglor finally stopped to eat, though he hummed amedley of old Morris dance tunes during dinner which put Sam andSpiegel right off their food.       Now it was early evening.  Sam stretched.  "Well, guess that'sthe end of the ol' Quest then," he said simply.  "If Frodo's dead andthe Ring gone, I guess there's nothing to do but go back to the Shireand light a few rich people's mansions on fire, as me Gaffer alwayssaid we ought to have done.  What about you, Spiegel?"       Spiegel looked at Sam.  Her thumb was deep in her mouth andher eyes were glazed in thought.  "Now that Baggins is dead," shereplied slowly, "my lifetime of seeking terrible revenge and livingin horrible self-loathing has reached its fruition.  So I guess I'llgo find a good therapist."       "I think," said Maglor, though nobody had asked him, "I thinkI'll wander by the shores of Lower Middle Earth for the rest of time,singing plaintively about my loss."       "Good idea," said Sam, who lived inland.       "At least until a profitable music recording industry isinvented," Maglor added.       "Perhaps you should get started, then," Sam said flatly,gesturing down the River.  "The Sea's down that way."       "Don't let us keep you," Spiegel added quickly.       "Uh, okay," Maglor replied.  Then he added, "But you've bothbeen so nice and we've been through a lot together.  I thought maybebefore I go I could make a ballad about you.  The Ballad Of Sam AndSpiegel-"       "No, that's okay," Sam said hastily.       "We don't need one," Spiegel jumped.       "No room in our packs for a ballad anyway-" Sam shouted.  Butit was too late.  Maglor began to sing:       Gamgee had come down from the Shire       To light up Frodo's funeral pyre       You knew his old head was       Just full of revenge       So he took his Master off to the East -Christ!" he finished suddenly, as Sam threw a cobblestone at his head.       "Shut it and be off with you!"       "You know it ain't easy," Maglor continued, trying to stayon the beat.  "You know how hard it can be."       "One more note and I stick my finger down my own throat,"Spiegel added, with the horrible tone of one who has successfullydone it before.       Maglor turned away, hoisting his guitar over his shoulder."The way that we're goin'," he said, "I'd better leave for the Sea." And with two more codas he wandered away towards the South grumblingabout how much easier it was to get gigs during the Kin-strife.       Sam slept soundly.  He dreamed of Frodo flailing about in theriver.  In the dream Frodo kept yelling to Sam for help.  Sam, standingon a pier five feet away holding a life-preserver, just laughed andlaughed.  The life-preserver was marked LUSITANIA, after the Elvenqueenof old.  Frodo's pack was full of cement blocks which Sam had tossedin at the beginning of their adventures.  Rosie appeared on the nextdock along with a cheering crowd.  She took off her dress and beganwaving it at him seductively.  Sam waded past the screaming Frodo totouch her.  She casually threw aside her flimsy garment.  In thatgesture she seemed to be throwing aside all the bourgeois capitalistsociety norms.  It was all she was wearing.  Sam's blood grew hotter.The dress made a raspy zzzrrrmpphhh noise as it fell to the quayside,and a distracting plonk, plonk as it landed...       Suddenly Sam awoke.  It was night in Disgiliath.  There wasanother zzzrrrmpphhh noise, and Sam realized with annoyance that itwas Spiegel snoring.  She lay just down the road with her headtipped back over a dislodged cobblestone.  zzzrrrmpphhh she wentagain.  Sam grumbled and rolled over, hoping to get back to hisdream, when from afar he heard another distant plonk.       Sam lay quiet and listened.       zzzrrrmpphhh zzzrrrmpphhh zzzrrrmpphhh.       plonk.       Sam closed his ears.  Rosie!  Sweet Rosie!  Let me get back tomy erotically-charged passionate horny dreams about Rosie.       zzzrrrmpphhh zzzrrrmpphhh.  A long silence.  The snores hadstopped.  Spiegel had rolled a different way and now lay on thecobbles with her hands in her lap and her legs spread, moaning quietlyin some desperately erotic dream of her own.       plonk.       Sam looked in the direction of the sound.  It came fromsomewhere near the Leonard of Quirm exhibit.  Or maybe further eastaround the Future Of Agriculture: Screw Archimedes! pavilion.  Ormaybe...       There was a flap.  Sam's eyes looked up.  Some blocks awaythe Sky Scraping Building loomed over their heads.       In the days of Insultir, grandson of Isildur and Andrea Doriathe Sea-queen, was Disgiliath the City of Tomorrow founded.  And manywonders were produced by the Atlanteans in those their glory daysthough most of their achievements failed just as the warranties wererunning out.  And chief among their wonders were the great spireswhich reached towards the stars: Orthanc the Eyesore of Isengard theybuilt, and Emyn Bereave of the North famed in legend before it fellover, and the Barad-dur which was built as a birthday-present beforebeing corrupted to evil.  Yet these were as assays in the craftbefore the building of Tol Ist, the Needle of Heaven, which legendsays scraped the very sky itself and rent holes in the ozone.Legend has it the stars had to detour around the top.  High overDisgiliath it loomed.  Even as it was being built Insultir said thatall buildings would be like it in the future: tall and imposing anddevoid of personality.       Yet Insultir's dream was to fail him.  With the lack ofelevators and adequate ventilation most people died before theyreached the top, and those who did survive the climb died becausethere was no indoor plumbing to provide water.  Even when one braveteam of adventurers made it to the top in later years, bearingflagons of water and the long-needed truss supports to complete theroof, their attempt at using the ganderobe resulted in the deaths ofthree of the party and nine civilians on the ground.  As time passedDisgiliath was abandoned and the narrow tower stood unfinished, asilent testament to the worthiness of building codes.       Sam's eyes took in the Tower.  At the very top he saw a giantwing stick out of the roof for a moment before retreating.  It couldjust be seen against the night sky.       Then far below he saw another movement, somewhere deep withinthe glass of the tower.  A tiny figure could be seen on the stairway.It tripped over some unseen obstacle which fell away below it with aplonk.  Even from here there was something familiar about the figure:a certain clumsiness, some shamed and shaking lust that drove thelittle shadow onward.       Sam moved quickly to wake the dreaming Spiegel.  He grabbedher and shook her thigh.       "Oh, no, no more, Sir Peter," Spiegel moaned.  "I simplycouldn't stand another sausage.."       "Wake up, ye wee bint," Sam growled, though the cries ofRosie were still hot in his own mind as well.  He tried not to lethis hand linger on her shaking leg.  "Wake up.  We're in trouble."       "Oh, very well, just five more before dinner..."  Spiegelcontinued, then wakefulness took her and she jumped, startled.  Shestared at Sam and turned aside quickly crossing her legs.  "I'mfine," she snapped.  "Just dreaming.  Perfectly healthy.  Perfectlynormal."  After a moment she looked again at Sam.  "Why are youwaking me up?  It's the middle of the night."       "Master Frodo's still alive," Sam whispered urgently."He's climbing the Tower.  I don't know what mischief he's up to."       It was short work to pack their provisions and walk thestreets to the base of the Tower.  Soon they reached the giant doorsof the great edifice.  Long ago had they been smashed by Orcs andvandals.  The lobby was filled with debris and the skeletons ofcorpses, some of which had dropped from a great height.  In thecorner stood the beginning steps of a great stair, which wound upthe sides of the tower and was lost to sight.       There were also many pieces of broken rock.  "What are thesefrom?" Spiegel wondered aloud.       "I think they're stairs that fell," Sam replied.  And indeedthe chunks of broken stone were very much the same shade and shapeas the stairs, which Sam and Spiegel now noticed were often crackedwhere they joined the wall.  Both looked at the stairs suspiciously."If I had my druthers," Sam said to himself, "I'd just stay here atthe bottom and kill Frodo as he came back down.  But I saw some sortof giant bird at the top of the Tower and there's no telling whetherMr Frodo might try to make a getaway on it.  That bloody bastardBilbo did something similar once."       "Damn it," Spiegel answered.  "I was really hoping he'ddrowned."       Someone had already pushed a path in the debris between thedoor and the stairs.  They followed the path and found a wet piece ofcard at a tight turning of the path.  Spiegel picked it up.  It wasa soaked waterlogged subscription card for Playtark.  "It's Frodoall right," she said sullenly.       Without speaking further they started up the stairs.       At first the steps were grimy and covered with dust, debrisand the occasional body.  As they progressed upwards the stepsgradually became less worn, and the dust and debris lessened.The two quietly continued upward.       The view out the windows gradually rose over the rooves ofDisgiliath.  Sam and Spiegel were able to see further and furtherinto the night as they slowly gained altitude.  Curiously, as theyclimbed higher the air became increasingly stifling.  "It's thisdamn glass," Spiegel gasped.  "None of the windows open.  Who woulddesign a building this way?"       "Some twit," Sam gasped in return.       They continued upward.  Spiegel walked just in front of Sam,stepping rhythmically up the long stairs.  Sam followed.  Being acouple of stairs behind, Sam's view consisted mainly of Spiegel'sass.  It continued bouncing just in front of him, flexing on oneside, then the other, then one side, then the other...       Sam was already exhausted.  The stairs and the lack of airwere torching his already overheated blood.  The curvature of Spiegeltempted him, tormented his hormone-crazed mind, yet it gave him thestrength to continue.  Yet in another way it also made it harder forhim to walk.  "Rosie," he said to Spiegel absently.  "How can youkeep going like that?"       "Stairmaster," Spiegel replied.  "Used it for months.  Itdidn't help."       They continued.  After another half-mile had passed the airhad become stifling as a glass-walled tomb.  Sam's hormones alonewere giving him the energy and will to go on, following that ass,those thighs...  The horny dreams of Rosie continued to play in hismind and in his blood.  Spiegel too seemed somehow distracted asthough her own dreams still kept a hold on her.       Then there was a sound like a gunshot!  The stone beneathSpiegel's feet broke from the wall and gave way!  "Sam!" she screamedand Sam threw himself at her shoving her down onto the unbroken stepnearer the wall.  He landed full on top of her.  She felt him againsther.       "Sam," she gasped.       "Rosie," Sam said.  Spiegel's nipples were hard through hervest.  One of her thighs felt warm and wet against his leg.  Her eyeswere pleading.       "I," Spiegel gasped.  "I - can't breathe..."       Without looking Sam reached over and grabbed a piece of stonefrom the broken stair.  He flailed over and smashed the nearest window.       Broken glass rained around them.  A rush of cool air and adusting of rain rushed over their hot bodies.  Air!  Cool andinvigorating it whipped against them, coursed through their lungs,over their overheated flesh.  Both felt suddenly alive, suddenly safe.They laughed for a brief moment, then suddenly became aware of eachother again.       "Sam," Spiegel said again.  Her eyes gazed into his.       "I - but Rosie - Spiegel, I..."  Sam stuttered.  Her lithe,eager body lay in his hands.  For a moment he was too overwhelmed tothink.  "I, I," he began, looking into Spiegel's questioning eyes.He truly wanted his Rosie.  Spiegel was just a traveling companion...yet so close, so willing.  Her arms were already reaching around him.He found his hands reaching for her vest of their own volition.Should he?  After all, he and Rosie weren't formally engaged.  Helooked again at Spiegel's face.  She gazed back at him with a hunger,for him, for acceptance...  After a breath one of her hands reachedslowly for his belt.  Her hips rose off the stair so that he couldslide her dress up more easily.  Should he take her and the releaseshe offered?  Would Rosie feel it was a betrayal?  Would the authorof a good versus evil fantasy novel actually write such a morallyambiguous action?       "Oh, the hell with it," Sam mumbled to himself.       "Oh Sam!" Her cries reverberated through the Tower."Oh Saaaaaaam!"       Now Sam walked in front, Spiegel following behind, their pacemore leisurely.  They stopped every twenty floors or so to smashanother window for ventilation.  Both were calmer.  A rain began tofall outside and Spiegel managed to refill a canteen from the waterrunning off a broken windowpane before they continued.       "I still feel a little odd all the same," Sam told her."I've told you about Rosie.  She's still my girl.  But...  but you'requite a woman.  And sexy.  Very sexy."       "So are you," Spiegel smiled.  "Rosie's lucky."       There was a change coming over Spiegel.  Even Sam had noticedit.  Before now she had always thought of herself as unsexy andunlovable.  Yet the passion that had consumed them had also made herview herself differently.  Before she had been certain she wasloathsome.  Now she was no longer sure what she was.       They continued for a moment in silence.       "Why did you come on this quest, Sam?" Spiegel asked.       Sam spat.  "At first because I was Frodo's servant," he growled."And then because I thought I could blackmail him.  And then laterbecause I wanted to see him die in th' hands o' the Dark Lord.  Butnow...  now an' I'll be honest I don't know why the hell I'm doin'it.  An' that's a fact."       Spiegel looked thoughtful.  "Then maybe we should just killhim," she volunteered.       Sam walked in silence for a moment.  When he spoke he wasangrier and his brogue was thicker.  "I'd love nothin' more than t'seethe wee pig bleed," he answered.  "It'd give me the the joyfuls,'twould.  But... either the Deed is good, or 'tisn't.  If 'tis, thenhe's trapped in Nurnenshire an' I get Bag End an' the resources I needt'start th' war ag'inst the bourgeoisie.  If 'tisn't, then I get MrFrodo Baggins back t' the Shire alive an' people'll lynch him andstart the Revolt sure as spades."       "Just like that?" Spiegel asked.       "Aye."  Sam smiled grimly.  "Most o' the economic troublesi' the Shire started when his nuncle Bilbo returned from foreign parts.About ruined the economy, he did, an' made the class divisions acutean' hard.  If Master Frodo so much as shows his face in the Shireagain after seein' foreign parts people'll roise up wi' torches andpitchforks rather than risk seein' that trouble agin, you mark mywords.  A Baggins returnin' from foreign parts is bad news, an'everyone knows it."       "But is all that necessary?" Spiegel asked.  "After all, youcan just kill him here.  End of Frodo Baggins."       "But there's others back in the Shire," Sam replied.  "Otherwealthy bastards there are, almost as bad as Mr Frodo.  I can't killthem all on my own, now can I?  No, Spiegel, I need to start a fireamong the people, that'll kill 'em all.  An' to light that fire oneway or th' other I need Mr Frodo alive.  Damn him."       Spiegel understood.  She said nothing.       "But once the fire's lit I'll have th' satisfaction o' killinghim later," Sam added quietly.       For an hour and yet another they continued.  Sam's legs werein agony as they began to near the summit.  Even Spiegel, veteran ofmany a piece of exercise equipment, was moving slowly and starting tolimp.  "Stairs," Sam began to mutter.  "I hate stairs."       "I'll never be able to look at another stairmaster ever again,"Spiegel gasped.       Once again Spiegel was in front.  Sam again had a constantview of her ass, but was now too tired from climbing to admire it.On a few occasions they had to work around the edges of broken stairswhich had fallen long years ago.  Below they could see the terrifyingdrop to the base of the Tower.  They tried not to look.       As they stopped for a moment to catch their breath they wentsilent.  Some eerie noise like a caw of terror came from above.  Itwas followed by a caw of disgust.  "Come on!" Sam said quickly."It's Mr Frodo, I'd bet.  We've got to hurry!"       There were only a few windings left of the great stair.Spiegel and Sam hurried up the last coils of the stairway as bestthey could.  Spiegel almost tripped and regained her footing.  AsSam followed her he could see what had been in her path: a discardedcopy of Playtark opened to an overused centerfold and Frodo's shoes.A feeling of dread horror and nausea came over him.  He hurried on.       At the top of the stairs there was a black hatchway in a blackceiling, the floor for the ancient parapet where Insultir oncepurposed to grasp the stars and hang advertising from them.  Thehatchway closed for untold generations now stood open.  The deepblue of the pre-dawn sky reached through it.  Spiegel went throughthe hatchway, Sam heard her scream and then she turned back to theopening with her hand over her mouth.  Sam heard voices as well.A huge leathery voice yelled:       "Get off!  Get off!"       "Feathers," cried the voice of Frodo.  "Oh God, feathers!"       "Leggo a me!  Leggo!"       Sam darted the last few yards and was struck by revulsion atwhat he saw.  A giant eagle, fully eighteen feet high, stood on thegreat parapet trying to balance its weight on one leg.  On that legwas Frodo, grasping the eagle with both arms and legs with eroticrapture and desperation mixed on his sweaty face.  The eagle wastrying to pull Frodo off his leg with the claw of the other leg.       "But feathers are erotic," Frodo whined.  "Pleease!"       "Stop humping my leg!" screamed the giant bird.  "Stop it!You there!  Will you get this thing off my leg!"       Sam, knowing an order when he heard one, looked around andfound a 2x4 from a roof truss abandoned centuries ago.  He quicklypicked it up and hit Frodo with it as hard as he could.  In his eroticdesperation Frodo hardly noticed so Sam stuck the 2x4 between Frodo andthe eagle and pried him loose.       "Oh God Sam," Frodo gasped.  "But I was so close."       "Oh, shut up," Sam replied angrily.  "And put your pants on,for God's sake.  Show some modesty."       "You don't know the weight of my burden," Frodo continued."That single Eye taunts me day and night."       "Ewwww," Spiegel said.       "What you need is a cold shower.  Here," Sam replied, and heunbelted his canteen and hit Frodo squarely in the face with it.Frodo subsided into a fevered swoon which was an improvement.       Sam stopped and looked around.  The place they found themselvesin was fully open to the sky, ringed by a stone wall roughly shoulder-high and clearly unfinished.  Rusted tools and pieces of a roof thatwas never built were lying off to one side.  There were low spots onthe wall where one could look down from the dizzying height if onedared.  In the middle of the open room stood the eagle.       Sam had heard stories about the eagles from Bilbo and Gandalfand the Elves and had quite reasonably thought they were all a packof lies.  Yet here stood one of the great birds before him.  "Areyou real?" he brought himself to ask.       "Are you?" the huge bird replied sarcastically.  "Am I real!Your nature-boy buddy seems t'think I'm real enough.  Did you seethat!  Disgusting, I call it.  Good thing you got here when you did,that's all I've got t'say."       "Sorry about that," Sam answered.  "He's just some sort ofpervert."       "I noticed," the eagle replied.  The bird walked over to thewall and began scraping his leg against the stone.  "Eucchhh.  I needa bath.  First people to climb up here in two thousand years and oneof 'em's gotta be an aviophile.  Say," the eagle turned to Sam.  "Areyou with him?"       "Uh," Sam replied, "no.  Well, sort of."       "What are you up to?" the eagle said suspiciously.       "Oh, nothing important, really," Sam replied looking away."Save the world, drop the Ring into Mordor, start a revolution, killa few hundred people.  That's all.  Nothing much, really."       "Oh, is that all?" the eagle replied, looking relieved.  "Well,good luck to you then."       The eagle turned away, evidently done with the conversation.It continued to examine and flex its leg.  Sam looked at Spiegel andat the swooning Frodo and thought how nice it would be to get thiswhole Mordor thing over with and start the Revolution.  He turnedagain to the eagle.       "Uh, Mr Eagle, sir," Sam began.       "What?" the bird replied impatiently, looking up only briefly.       "Well, uh, sir, would..."  Sam's mind raced through all thedrivel he had been forced to endure in Rivendell.  "Are you one ofthe great eagles of the King of the West, chief of the Velour andLord of All Western Lands Until The End Of The World?"       "Yeah," replied the eagle.  "So?"       "Well," Sam said hesitantly, "I was sort of hoping that youcould, you know, maybe see your way clear to, uh, helping us on ourquest and flying us and the Ring into Mordor and, well, that sort ofthing."       Sam took a breath to continue but stopped short as the eaglegazed at him.  The look in the bird's eyes made him step back.  Samsuddenly thought he should apologise and ask the bird to forget he'dever asked.  But the eagle spoke first.  "Quest, huh," it answered,biting off the word quest like a cracker.  "Want me to help on a quest,is that it?"       "Well, I-"       "Heh!" the eagle spat in disgust.  "'Oh Mister Eagle, there'sthis quest, could you just fly me somewhere?'  'Oh Mister Eagle, couldyou just take care of these wolves, we're on a quest you see'?  'Ohcute little birdie, Manwe needs a favor, could you just swoop down likean avenging army on these Orcs, you see it's for a quest?'  Think Ihaven't heard it before?  Think we haven't been pressed into serviceevery time someone has a little problem?  Think we eagles have nothingbetter to do with our time than fly around on quests?"       "Well, uh," Sam stuttered, "I once heard that you sometimes-"       "You once heard some stupid fairy-tale or another about howyour great grand-uncle the beer salesman invented fire and got savedfrom some mountain trolls by, let me guess, an eagle!  A giant eaglethat outflew the wind and killed the stonetrolls and got your unclea beer and never accepted payment and flew away never to be seen again,wasn't that it?"  The eagle sneered in disgust.  "Oh, yeah.  You knowall about eagles.  Everyone knows all about eagles."       "I don't," Spiegel said, genuinely innocent.  "What abouteagles?"       The eagle looked at Spiegel, startled.  It looked into hereyes for a long moment.  Then its expression softened.  "You reallydon't, do you?" it said.  "You haven't heard all the old stories."       "No," Spiegel said.  "I didn't get out much."       The eagle nodded.  Then it began to sing quietly.  It is saidby the loremasters that Lustianne of old taught the birds how to singand that in their voices one can hear the beauty of her voice but theeagles must not have been there for class that day because this one'ssong came out mainly as a series of harsh, rusty-sounding croaks:       Far off in time     in ancient days       When ancient powers     ruled the world       Were eagles made.      They grew in strength       And ate their food     from Manwe's hand.       At least at first.      But then the King       found work for us     and sent us off       To watch the world     or guard some pass       Or tidings bring.      And so we flew       Like errand-boys     around the world       To interfere     at Manwe's word.       For years and years     as Ages passed       We did the work.      The news we brought,       The Dragons fought,     the heroes saved       With never thanks.      And after time       We formed resent.      The Gods all sat       Upon their mountain     drinking beer       While all the Eagles     did the work.       "Oh Eagle, please     put out that fire,       Get me a drink,     fetch me a sword!       Be quick about it."     For all that       Nobody ever     gave us thought,       Sang out our tale,     wrote us a poem.       Deus ex machina     was our fate.       And yet we bore     indignities       In stoic silence.      So it went       Until Atlantis.                           Then that fool       Called Manwe got     this bright idea!       "I'll scare those guys!     To them I'll send       My eagles cloth'd     in clouds of night,       And lightning will     fall from their crowns."       And off we went.      That stupid fool!       He gave no thought     to our well-being       And sent us off     to Numenor       With lightning-rods     and Van de Graffs       To generate     electric charge,       Uninsulated!   Scare the Men?       We scared ourselves     and scarred ourselves       Much worse than they.      And many died,       like Thorondor     our mighty King       Who took a hit,     was shocked, and burned       And fell to ruin.      We left for good,       And Manwe had     to sink them all       Without our help.                             And now we live       in Middle-earth     on mountain-tops       and hidden caves.      We answer not       When Manwe calls.      We fly for fun       And laugh at men     and steal their sheep.       In legends we don't     interfere.       We might fly out     and help someone       Just for a laugh     or for a bribe       Of mutton dear,     if such we seek.       But "Ooo, a Quest!"     won't get you more       than laughing scorn     or falling rocks.What do you think?" the eagle concluded.       "It's a bit long," Sam muttered.       "Anyway, after that bit of Second Age stupidity we eagleshave kept mostly to ourselves.  It's nothing personal, but we'vegotta look out for ourselves, y'know.  It's kind of funny but-" theeagle leaned a little closer to Spiegel and spoke conspiratorially,"after we'd left, Manwe had t'do his own housekeeping as far as theworld's concerned, y'see?  He couldn't lean on us anymore, so now hestarts this new policy of 'Oh, don't want to go directly inter-ferin' in the world any longer,' 'cause he don't want t'do it himself,y'see? Personally, I think he's just a lazy bastard."       "Oh," Sam said.  There wasn't much to say.       "Well, thanks anyway," Spiegel said.  "I liked your story.I'm sorry we intruded on your time."       "Yeah, thanks a lot, sorry to disturb you, we'll just take ourpervert back downstairs now," Sam added.  Then he stopped.  He hadforgotten about the stairs.       "Uh, Mr Eagle," he started again nervously.  "Do you thinkyou could just maybe fly us back to Minas Tirith?  Or, well, just tothe base of the Tower?  I'll give you a sandwich.  It's got cornedbeef, see, look."       The eagle ignored him.       "Oh, the stairs," Spiegel frowned.  "I'd forgotten about thestairs."       The great bird looked up.  "You don't wanna take the stairs,miss?" he asked her.  "Can I give you a ride to the ground?"       "Oh, would you?" Spiegel smiled.       "Happy to," the eagle replied.  "You're a good listener, andyou seem friendly.  And you didn't ask me to go on any quests," headded, spitting out the word.  "Come on.  We can talk some more on theway down."       It seized her in a giant talon and stretched its mighty wings."Heh!  You don't weigh anything at all," it said.  Spiegel smiledbrightly and hugged the bird's ankle affectionately. They flewgracefully over the wall.       "When will you be back for us?" Sam called out.       "Heh!" the eagle snorted.  "You two can walk."       It was dusk of the next day before Frodo and Sam finally madeit back down the stairs.  "Ye'll never see me using a staircase againfor the rest o' my life," Sam grumbled.  "Not ever ever ever."       "I don't know what's coming over me, Sam," Frodo said.  "Ithink the Ring is affecting me.  All my thoughts are becoming twisted.I fear I'm only going to get more perverse as we near Mordor."       "Tough break for ye," Sam muttered.       Frodo nodded.  "Last night as I was climbing the Tower I evenhallucinated.  I thought I heard you making love to that scarecrow.Hah!  If you could even imagine that."       Sam's eyes blazed red fury, but he said nothing.       They came out the great doors and found Spiegel waiting forthem in the street.  "That eagle was so nice," she smiled.  "Andlook!  He left us some mutton!  And he gave me a card with the nameof a good therapist on it."       Frodo almost replied, but a sudden elbow from Sam cut himoff.  "Oh, sorry, Master," he said with only a little biting irony.       Later on they found the bridges to Minas Tirith were all out,and so they unwillingly went back to the cross-roads from whence theycame.  Late on the third night they made it back to the crossing,where they found Gullible sitting on a rock idly drumming his fingers.       "'Sss about time you made it back, saddam," he hissed.
     Accompained by a soft stream of saddams, Gulible viewed thecompany in disgust. Sam was wearing a happy yet resolute face whichpractically screamed, "I'm a continually failing, eternally doubtingrevolutionary, but at least I know how to handle the ladies"; and hekept throwing quick glances at Spiegel, who ignored them with amysterious inward smile. Frodo kept tugging at his clothes for noobvious reason, except perhaps for a crawling slug he had noticed onthe roadside. Gulible sighed.     "We can't stay here, precious, no, saddam," he said, and noticinghow little effect his voice had on them, raised it from a wheeze to arasp. "Would any of you like to see the pleasures this place has tooffer?" he asked with a sly grin.     For lack of better suggestions they followed him, through lushgreen parks and stately piazzas, until they reached the pulsatingentertainment district of Disgiliath, known for some unknown reason asCirith Ungallant. All of a sudden they found themselves surrounded byit all: flashing lights, flashing dresses, leering orcs singingoperettas in falsetto. "It's a fallen place, and that's a fact," saidSam, regarding a dancing southron of the female variety with all thedisapproval he could muster.     "Yeah, and it's horribly sexist," said Spiegel, who was busycondemning a display of imaginatively shaped dildos.     At the call of Gulible they ran to a store of leatherwares whereFrodo sat in the innermost corner, refusing to come out. "They're mine,precious! We wants them!" he screamed whenever someone tried to takeaway the studded collar and leash he was clutching. The proprietor'sassurances that the items were meant for dogs only did not help onelittle bit, but at last Sam managed to lure him out with a promise ofa chic poodle trim at the next dog hairdresser they spotted."Hopefully he'll think he's a tortoise by then," Sam muttered toSpiegel, "that idiot, inbred aristocrat." His confidante failed toanswer, however, too occupied in admiring a shiny leather corset.     Finally they were out in the street again, Spiegel several parcelsheavier. "They're the new me," she explained to Sam when he questionedher latest investments. "You don't own me, you know." They continuedtheir ideological discussion as Gulible led them past a gloomy jointcalled "The Mouldy Vampire" decorated with an enormous replica of abat. As Frodo stopped and stared longingly at the giant creature ofthe night, the doors swung open and a dark crowd emerged. They woreall sorts of black clothes: coal-black velvet, soot-black silk,gleaming black PVC. But all their faces were pale, and their angstyexpressions filled the company with fear.     "It is too late! All is lost! I am so hungry," Frodo suddenlywailed, as someone pushed him out of eye contact with his favouriteflying rodent. (Of course bats aren't rodents, really. But thisparticular one - long-eared, long-toothed and carrying a magnificentcarrot - could certainly pass for one.)     "Be quiet, Frodo," said everyone; and then Gulible explained:"They're just a band of wandering visit-goths, on their way to destroysome empire or other. They're none of our business, saddam."     Frodo looked at their guide with newfound respect. "By jove,Gulible!" he exclaimed. "For one with such freakish speech impediments,you sure know a lot!"     "Yes, saddam," muttered Gulible softly and turned away.     They did their best to mingle with the Disgillians - in order tobetter understand their culture, they all agreed. "The bush... thebarsh will not be burned against the wall, come the revolution," saidSam loudly, after they had had a thorough introduction to the drinkingcustoms of the area. Spiegel nodded and smiled while Gulible desperatelytried to edge his barstool closer to hers.     As it finally tipped over, she gasped and pointed. "Oh my Eru...Look!"     Sam looked up, suddenly sober, and saw Frodo up at the bar, doingan extravagant performance of the Bree-dance.     "Quick, take Gulible!" he barked, knowing they had to stop hismaster at once. Spiegel understood immediately, and together they swungtheir guide through the air so that he collided with Frodo with asatisfying thud.     "I can see stars, Gulible," whispered Frodo later. He giggledinsanely. "But my head is in the ocean."     "That's because we're in the gutter, preciousss," said Gulible, andfought a sudden urge to kick the drunken hobbit. Getting the group tothe goal seemed more and more difficult. "Sam? Spiegel? Where areyoussss?" he cried, fearing the worst.     "We're coming... soon, Gulible," answered Sam in a muffled voice,and some minutes afterwards they emerged from a back alley, Spiegelrearranging her parcels with elaborate care.     "Look, Frodo," she said at last, handing him a small paper bag."I bought you one after all." Frodo dried his tears and opened thepresent.     "It's beautiful!" he exclaimed, suddenly happy again. "May I putit on now?"     "If you wish, Master," said Sam solemnly. "And I'll take the leash,if you allow, Sir."     And so they were on their way again, Gulible in the lead, Frodo inthe leash, and Sam and Spiegel in an inexplicable fit of giggles. Thescenes were becoming even more spectacular, there were lights, coloursand cheerful people (or something similar) everywhere. Frodo stopped and said: "What is this place, Gul...omph!"     As they walked on, Gulible answered: "We're now in the heart ofCirith Ungallant. This is the original entertainment district, of whichall other glitzy places are mere copies. They say a new position isdiscovered every day here." He glanced at Sam and Spiegel. "Withcertain restraints, of course. Saddam."     Loud music and cheers erupted from a palace-like building at theend of the street. Gulible quickened his pace as he walked towards it,Spiegel ran after as she remembered she really had to do a thing notalways mentioned by authors, and Sam marched briskly after them,dragging Frodo behind him. Gulible greeted the bouncer as an oldfriend and Spiegel scurried past him looking for the closest loo. Theguide turned around with a great smile as he said to the bouncer: "Andthiss is the Ringbearer."     Sam had just reached the door and was panting heavily. "I'mafraid," he gasped, "I'm afraid I just strangled the Ringbearer."
     It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsexcept at occasional intervals, when it was checked by aviolent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it isin Mordor that our scene lies, or close enough as nomatter), rattling along the housetops, and fiercelyagitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggledagainst the darkness.  Sam thought he heard the sound trackto some horror flick or other, but couldn't be sure.     He was standing around awkwardly holding the apparentlydefunct Frodo's leash, in the magnificent piazza that formedthe centre of Cirith Ungallant.  Gulible looked at him withirritation; the bouncer, an immaculately clad Orc, with mildamusement.  Fearful and yet insidiously attractive was thevista that opened itself before his eyes, like that of a B-rated horror film combined with that of a science-fictiondictatorship combined with that of a second-ratepornographic film. The setting was very noir, with muchchiaroscuro, like the old Batman comics in the youth of theShire.  Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw avehicle on which was written the words "Mystery Machine."The female pulchritude on display assaulted his senses likeunto the onslaught of Mordred's forces upon the Vale ofGondolas.     An eeresome Nightclub, bedight with Halloweenery andenshrouded in bright tang-coloured orange, lowered beforetheir awe-stricken gaze. They beheld on its steps many ajack-o-lantern, within which flickered a deadly sheen, acorpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing (or so Frodoalways said; but Sam and Spiegel thought it was marvellous -"just like Times Square," the latter said, cryptically).Resplendent with neon lights was the Nightclub, and bedightwith a thousand posters such as simply would not have beenallowed in the Shire.  A spider-motif dominated thebuilding, with iron gates and fences, as well as windows,filigreed in the manner of spider webs. They were come tothe most fashionable district west of Barad-dûr, and thebat-motif of the older-buildings was nowhere to be found. The Halloween kitsch filled Sam with a sense of dread."I do believe in spooks," he muttered in a Brooklyneseaccent.  Most terrifying of all was the entrance, with itsincandescent jack-o-lanterns and plastic ghosts andskeletons; an enormous rubber spider hung from one of thetowers.  On a large neon sign they beheld the words"Hselob's Niggitculb," written in teuncwar.     But at the moment, Sam had a more immediate concern. Itappeared that he had tied Frodo's collar a little too tight,motivated perhaps by some unconscious desire to get rid ofthe ugly and sexually challenged reactionary decadentexploitative despicable bastard; but he was not yet dead.     "With slow, stupid hobbit's lab kit, we might be ableto do something, my preciousss," muttered Gulible. "Forkit over, saddam!"     Reluctantly Sam obeyed, and Gulible got to work withpracticed expertise: he examined the contents of Sam'slaboratory kit, grunted with satisfaction, and then mixedthe contents of various test-tubes together with the air ofone who knows exactly what he is doing.     "Don Giovanni hass produced a chemical compound thatwill revive nasty rich hobbit," he said at length. "Itwill also causse a very ssslight reduction in thepatient'ss erotic madness, precious.  It may have someside-effects, owing to the predominance of 2-amino-2-deoxy-[..."     "Just gie it to the scoundrel!" said Sam.     Gulible carefully poured the contents of one of histest-tubes down Frodo's left nostril. After a bit ofwheezing and coughing, Frodo sat up and blinked his eyes inconfusion.      "Where am I?" he asked.  "I feel... different.  I nolonger need to have sex all the time; only three fourths ofit. And I am no longer sexually attracted to everything Isee, only most things."     "Pretty impressive, Giovannino!" said the bouncer.     "Aw, shucksses; biochemistry is just one of ourhobbies, saddam," replied Gulible.     The bouncer was about to reply when Spiegel came backfrom the restroom, bubbling with delight.     "What a wonderful country this is!" she cried. "Ientered the women's room, fully expecting to find somedisgusting hole in the ground, as in the Shire.  Instead, Ibeheld an object of great beauty: a large white porcelainbowl, full of limpid water, and behind it a rectangularwhite tank adorned with a mysterious metal handle.  Howclean and lovely it is!  I nabbed a towel on the way out -may I keep it?"     "It's all yours, ma'am," said the bouncer politely.This was the First Towel.     "Yet another modern improvement of whilk the oppressorshae depreeved us," observed Sam.       "Um, who's that guy?" asked Spiegel, referring to theubiquitous portraits of a guy who looked like a head with anenormous eye in the middle, but no torso to speak of.     "Yon must be Sauron," said Sam.  "Dinna ye see theposters, urging all tae 'Adore Sauron, Our Beloved Leader,'or pointing out that 'Sauron Loves You, Especially If You'reFemale'?"     "He's handsome!" gushed Spiegel.  "I wonder if he has agirlfriend?"     "He doessss, my precioussss," said Gulible. "Look!"  Hepointed at a portrait of a scantily clad eight-legged womanwith a very voluptuous bosom, underwritten "Shelob Is theLove of Sauron's Life."     "Well, at least thanks to Boromir and Sa... y...well, that really good-looking guy who makes love like amûmak in heat, I know I'm not ugly," sighed Spiegel. "Butif only I could have a guy who actually loved me for myselfinstead of lusting for my famous bosom just once in my life,I could die happy. Our bodies are not our selves."  Samsaid nothing, but tried to control the ravenous desire thatdevoured his limbs like unto a bevy of hobbits in a mushroom-patch. Gulible made no such effort, but slobbered openly.Fortunately, their attention was distracted somewhat by thelovelies on view; for the loremasters say that Shelob'sNightclub gave a new meaning to the phrase, "nekkidwimmin."     "May you soon get your wish," said the bouncer toSpiegel, with deep sincerity. The bouncer was an attired inan elegant uniform emblazoned with the Eye of Sauron and theWeb of Shelob. He looked very sharp, if somewhat swarthy andbrachycephalic, as befits demonized Others.     "This place is so beautiful!" said Spiegel wistfully."Please tell us where we are!"      "This is Shelob's Nightclub, the Wonder of the World,owned and operated by the wogah of Sauron the Great," hereplied. "Gorbush at your service," he added, kissingSpiegel's hand. "Would you like to come in?"     "Aye," said Sam.  "We would."     "I would need to question this lady in private, first,"said Gorbush, but his voice and the look he gave Spiegelmade it only too evident what kind of questioning he hadin mind.     Spiegel smiled. "That seems only reasonable."     "Enchanted," said Gorbush, and the twain went off, armin arm, to some obscure side-room or other.  As they watchedher, Sam and Gulible were seething with lust and jealousy;Frodo, on the other hand, was distracted by the torment ofthe Stone, which made him lust after fishes, and of theRing, which made him believe he had a chance in Angband ofseducing them. Spiegel was apparently taking her time.     After an hour or two Spiegel came back with Gorbush onher arm.  "Gorbush is a really sensitive guy," she said."He writes poetry and really knows how to make a girl gowogah!" Sam and Gulible's eyes bored into the Orc's facewith all the benevolent subtlety of a Mentish laser ray.      "I did not realize your situation was so bleak," saidGorbush.  "This lovely lady" - he stroked Spiegel's long,silky-soft hair - "is worth a hundred floor shows. You cango in, but I'm going to have to escort you, in order toprotect the lady. We have to be careful, on account of thatevil drug cartel."     "Dinnae mention the Ring, master!" cried Sam, beforesuddenly realizing his mistake.  "Och nae!" he groaned indespair.  "If ye keep openin' your big mouth ye'll end upbetrayin' the Cause, as me gaffer always used tae say, andthat's a fact.  Ye're nocht but a Menshevik, he mostwaysused to add.  But I'll nae be captured by Sauron thateasily.  I'll sell me life dearly."  He took out his swordand drew it.     "What are you getting so operatic about?" inquiredGorbush, apparently taking little interest in the Ring."You are our honoured guests.  Both Shelob and Sauron willbe eager to meet you. You will be spending the night in theNightclub's guest-quarters until Sauron the Great can findyou more worthy lodgings.  But for now, would you like toenjoy the floor show?  There is nothing to fear."     Sam wasn't so sure, as he heard a shrieking soundissuing from the bowels of one of the guardrooms: it mighthave been a damned spirit, it might have been an Elvishcaptive, it might have been an inebriated Balrog, it mighteven have been Maria Khallas, but it was probably someoneenjoying the floor show a leetle too much. His curiosityovercame his fear. Anyway, they had no other plan at themoment, so they followed the Orc into the Nightclub. WhenGorbush uttered the password Trick or treat, Frodo couldnot suppress a shudder.     Ignoring the remarks of the habitués, like "Not fromaround here," and "The clientele are becoming frightfullycommon," the companions entered and gazed at the brightlights and gorgeous semi-clad beauties such as HughHefnaistos, who was what passed among the Valar for the Godof Wisdom, might have dreamed up in a delirium. One of them,a very provocatively dressed blowfish, was ensconced insidean aquarium tank. Orcs silently served the companionspicturesque local alcoholic beverages.     "These are the 'Rog Grisettes," said Gorbush after theparty had stared at the beauties for several minutes? hours?days? - for they soon lost all sense of time and distance."Except that one of them - Froufrou - is a blowfish. That'sa little kinky for my tastes ..."     The Balrog Grisettes pitilessly exposed their lovelinessto Sam and Gulible's heterosexual gaze. Whether Sam too hadsome cursed article of clothing - like everyone else(possibly his socks) - or the lustful side of hispersonality, which Spiegel called Kinko, was once againgaining the upper hand over the loyal revolutionary (whomshe called Pinko), this tale does not tell.     Frodo had eyes only for Froufrou the blowfish, or elsefor his shoelaces.  The sinuous sensuality of her scalesmade him go wogah.  For need drove him.     "I want to grip her smooth, scaly body between my-"     "I dinnae want to hear it," said Sam. "I was sick ofyour sex life months ago, an' that's a facht!!!!!"     Things got even worse for the hobbits when theGrisettes began to sing a tune by Orc-operetta composerLehár:     Tra-la-la-la-la-la-lally!     Trippel trapp and trippel trapp!     Welcome all to Shelob's Valley,     Trippel trapp and trippel trapp!     We are the 'Rog Grisettës,     have wings and castañetas:     Lolo, Dodo, Joujou, Cloclo, Froufrou, Morgot...(But Froufrou of course sang "fins," not "wings.")Frodo's heart caught fire; and without thinking of what hedid, whether he acted out of folly, despair, courage, orinsatiable lust, he jumped onto the stage and into theaquarium, taking the phial in his left hand while hecaressed Froufrou the Fish with his right, before kissingher ardently. Then he belted "Et moi!" - upon which hepromptly stared at his shoelaces again while Froufroulaughed provocatively.  The audience roared its approval.     But there are other powers in Muddle-earth, powers ofthe night; and they are tildy and strong.  And She who dweltin the darkness had heard the Elves give that cry in thedepths of time, and it had not troubled her then; nor did itnow.  While Frodo spoke, he felt a great malevolencedirected towards him and a deadly gaze. The coming threatwas at last unveiled.  For Shelob, when she appeared, waseven hotter than her posters had depicted her. The glow ofthe star-glass was broken by the thousands of facets of herbosoms, but behind the glitter a deadly flame began to glow,kindled by evil thoughts.  Monstrous and lasciviously half-closed eyes she had, but guided by a goal and a dreadpurpose, and they gloated over their prey that sat helplesswithout any hope of escape; either that, or Frodo had hadfar too much fermented bat's blood (or was it a side-effectfrom Gulible's medicine?), for Sam and Gulible recollectednothing more untoward than an unusual degree of femalepulchritude.     There long had she dwelt, a sensual creature inMaidenform® (or out of it, as the case might be) - the sameas of old dwelt in the land of the Elves that has sunkbeneath a mounting pile of debt; like unto those whom Blutohad tried to seduce in the Mountains of Wogah in Doriath andhad come long ago over the green grass in Lustianne.  HowShelob came to Mordor, fleeing from her creditors, no taletells; for few accounts remained open in the Dark Years.But she was there still, who was there before Sauron, andbefore the first stones of the Barad-dûr Museum, Opera-House, Fortress of Dread, and Ballet Theatre were laid; shehad built her nightclub there, gouging the wallets of Elvesand Men.     Then Sauron had shown her what wogah was really allabout, and her bosom became swollen and fat from continuousstimulation in Sauron's revels.  For all portions of thefemale anatomy were Sauron's food, and Shelob's pheronomeswere darkness.  Far and wide were scattered their offspring -even as far as the Shire - bastards of their miserablemates, whom they had rather left holding the baby.  But noneof Sauron's women could rival her, Shelob the Great, hottestbabe of Ungallant to wogah the tildy world.     And as for Sauron, he knew where she lay.  And itpleased him that she should dwell there, hungry butundiminished in physical attributes, a more insatiablenymphomaniac than his own fantasies could have devised.  Orc-maidens had made nice enough concubines, but he had them inplenty, and after all, they lacked the sexual capacity ofthe Maiar.  Shelob had that and to spare.  And as a man maythrow a dainty to his cat ("his cat," he calls her, but sheowns him not), so Sauron had added various adornments andbeautification projects to Shelob's Nightclub, making it thegaudiest such institution west of Minas Vegas.     Shelob sauntered onto the stage, gnawing the skull ofthe Hobbits dared not guess what creature, but they weresure it tasted just like chicken.  A loud chord resounded inthe orchestra.  As Gulible gazed upon her lascivious form,he was filled with an intense, almost uncontrollable desireto wogah her, were it only symbolically. "Ah, could we butpierces her with something...!" he thought, as heexperienced a physical reaction to her figure.  Forgotten asthe snows of yesteryear (for the moment) was his burningpassion for Spiegel - much to the latter's relief.  She sangthe following csárdás with such intensity that the evilGandalf himself, had he heard it, would have wept:             Vere dvells ze lawve zen?                Ho can me tellink?             Vere dvells ze lorve zen?                Ho ken I eszkink?Then she ripped into the fast movement like a thunderstormover the steppes of Rhûn:    Juszt vonce to vogah, vogah, vogah, vogah,            On ze puszta, by ze Volga,            Juszt vonce to get it on!  The hobbits' blood was churning like a samovar kindled bythe Magic Sun, and when she repeated the song, her passionenflamed the Nightclub to such an extent that thethermometer went up at least twenty degrees Fahrenheit.     When the guys had recovered, they were gazing uponShelob with the gaze of the damned.  "How charmink to meetyou, dahlink!" she said to Frodo.  "May I invite you andyour friends to spend the night and tomorrow to join me fora small, private luncheon for six (not countink ze dancinkgirrls, off curse)?"     "Six?" repeated Frodo, puzzled.     "Vell, yess! You, your sree friends, myself, and Sauronze Great..."     "Ulp!" stammered Frodo.  "Sauron, er, um, whatdoes he want with me?"     "Ve have much to discuss," said Shelob, with a crypticsmile.  "Your estate, for eenstance..."     "Oh, my estate!" said Frodo with a sigh of relief.     "Yes, vat did you sink it vas?" said Shelob. "I hopeyou not gettink your image of me from zose sensationalisticmovies starring Humphri Bogart." Frodo was nonplussed.     "Gorbush!" Shelob whispered to that worthy. "Take zeseguests to ze Lairr! Lurtz, you take Gorbush's place!"     Gorbush led them through the plush, if creepy,vestibule to the elevators, and they travelled up to thethirty-second floor.  Unknown to the hobbits was thisdwimmercaft, and they were sore adrad. The omnipresentvelvet and gilt spider motif began to get rather oppressive.After letting Frodo into an incredibly palatial room fit fora conquering hero or a tobacco lobbyist (with its ownaquarium), Gorbush let Sam and Spiegel into a neighbouringroom, apologizing profusely for the fact that there were notenough rooms for them to be separated at the moment.Gulible,  barely containing his jealous rage, went to sleepin his usual spot, not far from the ladies' changing room.The orc made some polite apologies to Sam and Spiegel forhaving to leave them and, after gallantly handing Spiegel abook of his poems autographed with seven or eight improvisedpoems in her honour - some of them rather explicit - heleft.     Spiegel quickly hid the book of poems in her bra.  Shewas intent upon exploring their room, which was filled withbooks with titles like Nymphomaniacs and Their Ways:Towards a Porno-Ethics of Existentiality and Are Ments aMyth?  The walls, ceiling and bedclothes were covered withthe usual spider-motif.  So was the bath-towel that Samsequestered for his own use (this was the Second Towel). Onthe mantelpiece there were several Lladró figurines ofspiders, Balrogs, Orcs, and other Mordor species, dressed inpicturesque native garb.  Spiegel picked up the rather heftytome entitled Blueprint for the New Order, by Sauron, andstarted leafing through it - murmuring things like, "Sothat's what Gorbush meant when he said Sauron has solutionsfor the evils that bedevil Western society" or "He is avisionary!" or "Imagine a society based upon love!"     "What next?" said Sam, subtly ripping off his shirt.     "Oh, Sam," she said tenderly, "It was you who awakenedme to the fact that I am indeed sexually attractive. I oweyou so much! But can't you see that it was not meant to be?You must be loyal to Rosie, and I must be true to Gorbush,who alone truly loves me!  He massaged me for a whole hourbefore smygelling me!"     "Very well," said Sam with resignation. "If ye needme, I'll be in the bathroom."  He was there for quite along time.     Spiegel felt a little bad about her treatment of Sam,but she knew that after sleeping with Gorbush she couldnever again have another guy - not even Sam, however fondshe was of the latter.  For his lust was not her lust.Little she knew of towers, rings, or Politburos, who desiredonly the joy of all other living things, and for herself anall-encompassing love, swollen till the mountains could nolonger contain it, or the darkness circumscribe it.     Next morning Sam and Spiegel took Gulible to Frodo'sroom, and naturally found the boss firmly ensconced in theaquarium. Sam fished Frodo out. While his boss was gettingcleaned up and dressed, Sam, under some mysteriousinspiration, sang "Se vuol ballare, signor Frodino" in anunknown and sinister language that filled Frodo with dread.     When Gorbush came with breakfast, Spiegel leapt intohis arms.  After they had exchanged a few amorouspleasantries, Gorbush turned to the others and said, "Thereason I've come is to inform you that Shelob - and laterour Beloved Leader, Sauron the Great -  will be comingshortly to honour you with a visit.  You are indeed high inhis favour! I can't stay, I'm afraid.  But I'll be backlater when the coast is clear.  Have a nice day!"  With thathe hastily left - after Orkish-kissing Spiegel for abouttwenty minutes.     The hobbits barely had time to agree not to sayanything about the Ring ("the present," as Don Giovannimysteriously called it), when Shelob arrived in a blacknegligée that flattered her figure yet more than had thewhite gauze she had worn the night before. She chatted withthe hobbits about this and that - the weather in the EthelDuwap, the fashions of Minas Goofy, the latest gossip aboutthe Leechking's love-life - taking a great interest in theirtravels.  Presently, however, she turned to Spiegel andcrooned:     "My dahlink child, do you have any idea who you reallyare?"     "Well, all I know is that I always thought I was fatuntil the late Boromir and... that other guy, my truefriends, showed me that I am not ugly.  It took Gorbush toshow me that I am indeed beautiful and worthy of love." Shewept tears of pure joy.     "You are my descendant, ze rightful heir to Rivendell.El Rond is a usurper who would never have gotten anywherehad he not been one of the hangers-on of ze despicableGandalf - procured animals for heem, I believe, or somesinkeqvally disgusting...  In truth it vas Steinlob the Feministwhose labors made Rivendell possible.  I am Steinlob'sdaughter, and you are my great-great-great-great-granddaughter by Smaug, vich ees givink you dragon-blood. Mydaughter invaded ze Shire vone bright day, and ze reszt eezheestory.  Zat vas before I met Saury and discovered ze truemeanink of vogah. Ven my hubby delivers ze lands of ze Vestfrom ze yoke of zeir current imperialist-hegemonist-neofascist runnink dogs, ve shall restore you to yourrightful place."     Spiegel's eyes shone.  "And Gorbush will rule Rivendellby my side!" she gushed.     "Vatever you vant, dahlink," said Shelob,affectionately kissing Spiegel. "And ve have summonedCassiopeia Took back to Mordor so zat she can return zeDress to you. And you'll get your identity back. It von'thave ze disgustink stains on it eizerr - ze dress, not zeidentity, ahf coarrse."     Spiegel laughed through her tears. Then she asked, "Isthere any way I can arrange therapy sessions with DeeannaTroll?  An eagle recommended her to me and gave me herbusiness card."     "Ve vill speak of ziz later," said Shelob, glowering atthe mention of Deeanna Troll.  "But I sink eet not necessaryeef you gettink ze dress back."     Presently there was another knock at the door, quiet,but portentous.  As Sam opened the door, he beheld a legionof female Orcs, fawning all over none other than the dreadSauron in person.  Sam easily recognized him from theportraits he had seen, but yet more from the sinister menaceof his urbanity, the elegant veneer of malignancy thatconcealed a fundamental dorkiness.  Sauron waved a glovedhand, and the Orcs vanished.     "So many female admirers," he sighed.  "A wiseloremaster once pointed out that we males are not naturallymonogamous.  Having used the Ring, I'm sure you know whatit's like. I am pleased to meet you," he continued in apleasant, yet insidious, baritone, recalling the refinedaccents of Sideshow Bob.  "We were so worried that thosenarcoterrorists might have done something nasty to you. TheWestern part of my domain isn't as safe as I would like; tooclose to Gondor. I am Sauron the Great, at yourservice."     Sam smiled grimly, before asking Sauron, "What's itwairth tae ye?"     "What do you mean?" inquired Sauron.     "Dinnae be sae Foucauldian.  I ken ye wants the Ring.Mak us an offer, or we'll do nocht, and say nocht."     Sauron laughed a sonorous laugh.  Spiegel began to findhim almost more irresistable than Gorbush.     "Oh, the Ring!" he smiled.  "We can talk aboutthat later.  Though I wouldn't use it if I were you; it wasreally only meant for Maiar. And whatever you do, don't dropit into Mt. Viagra, or Gandalf and his evil allies will takeover the world and enslave everyone and turn them intodrugged out zombies without hope."  The hobbits gasped, butSauron, after giving them a sad smile, continuedunperturbed. "I would also avoid using the phial in yourplace, as it is the creation of the evil Fleanor (whom theGnomes call Feenamint) and works his will.  But at themoment I have to give you important news.  For none of youis the insignificant halfling that he or she appears to be -except for you, Gulible, or Gullible, or however you'respelling your nom de guerre these days.  I fear you arebut another interesting narrative irrelevancy."     "We not interesting irrelevancy!" protested Gulible."We Gulible the Great, the Gulible, seduce girlses tentimes a day, Don Giovanni, who bedded 640 women inBree, 231 in Gundabad, 100 in Rivendell, 91 in Trollshaws,but, but, but in the Shire, but in the Shire, we've done1003...!"     "Relax," said Sauron.  "We'll give you a free MordorCredit Card as compensation for not being anyone'sdescendant.  Maybe we'll even put you in charge of the Shireor something."     Gulible seemed pleased by this notion, for he began tomutter, "We shall see, my precious! With credit card we'llpay her back!  We'll pay everyone back!"     "Indeed!" said Sauron, smiling a mysterious, ambiguoussmile that could have meant anything from civilacknowledgement of Gulible's somewhat deranged response to acynical, even sadistic amusement.  "Let us be at ease," hecontinued.  "Fermented bat's blood?"  He held up a bottle ofsome nasty black liquid. The hobbits all agreed withalacrity, and Sauron poured drinks all around, starting withSpiegel, to whom he handed a glassful in an elegant mithrildemitasse adorned with Balrog wings.  "The vintage isexcellent.  It's been aging ever since the forging of theRing."     "Ye said ye had news," observed Sam.     "I do," said Sauron, solemnly.  "Frodo, I am yourfather.  You are my son and heir.  The Nurnenshire estate isbut the beginning.  If you are found worthy, you shallreign over vast kingdoms." (There was a subtle hint of doubtin the if.) "I owe you a few birthday presents," he smiledthrough his tears, as the violins played some mushy tune orother.  Frodo gaped in amaze, while Sam chortledsarcastically behind his hand.     "B-b-b-but, I thought Bilbo was my father," stammeredFrodo.     "He was.  But I am your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.A couple of millennia ago, I had a fling with a winsomehobbit-lass on the banks of the Anduin, before your peoplemoved out of the range of my geographical knowledge.  It wasa moment of weakness; I was on the rebound from Miniwethil,and hadn't yet translated my wogah-WOOOgah with Shelob intosomething more or less permanent.  (Ouch, Shelob makes myhands itch.)"  He stopped for a moment and Orkish-kissedShelob while fondling her passionately. After about half anhour, he resumed: "I thought of telling my hobbit-descendants the truth, but never met anyone who seemedworthy, until I heard of you.  I had to disown my brotherSaurtre after he got involved with those narcoterrorists inthe Morgai.  Even with you, it's a bit of a stretch, but ifyou stay away from drugs, straighten up your sexualidentity, get indoctrinated out of your aristocraticideological presuppositions, pass the test of governing theestate in Nurnenshire (which we're turning into a collectivefarm), and develop something remotely resembling moralfibre, who knows?  Greatness may well be thrust upon you, myson."     The hobbits maintained a stunned silence, but Sauroncontinued his exposition.     "Yes, one reason I wanted you here was to protect youfrom a murderous plot hatched by the drug cartel (NICE, alsocalled That Hideous Strength) run by Gandalf, El Rond, TomBombadildo (whose sex life with Goldberry may fairly bededuced from his name), the Talking Fox, and the mysteriousBrute of Bucklebelt, whose identity I have not yet been ableto determine, and possibly Galadriel, though my groping gotme nowhere with her." Shelob gave a baleful glare.     "O Great Leader!" cried Frodo, kneeling.  "How can Iget rid of the phial!? Is there no briar patch into which Ican toss it? And why did Galadriel ever give it to me? Ithas inflicted upon me a really embarrassing curse."     "We'll give it back to Maglor," said Sauron casually."It's his, he wants it, and frankly he deserves it.  As forGaladriel, if she cheats on her husband, she can also cheaton you."     "But El Rond ..." began Frodo.     "Yes, I know about all that, having a very effectiveintelligence corps, but since he's not the rightful ruler ofRivendell, we'll just consider his little document null andvoid."     "Father!" said Frodo, joyfully. "You are gracious to mebeyond my dessert!"     "We wants CHOKLIT, my precious!" interrupted Gulible,his eyes turning purple at the mention of "dessert." SilentOrc-servants deftly carried out Don Giovanni's wish, as Samcontinued to scowl.     "Weell, if this spineless effeminate bourgeois decadentis the descendant of Sauron, I suppose I'm the scion ofFeenamint," Sam could not quite repress his sarcasm.     "Not quite," said Sauron with a smile.  "However,Lenindil - for that your true name - you are the heir ofIsildur."     "What about Aragon son of Arathon son of Aradud son ofArabarf?" blurted Frodo.     "Who, that?" said Sauron.  "Aragon the Simple! Aragonthe Fool!  But he had just enough wit for the part Gandalfhad appointed for him.  But as for his lineage, it's forged.The truth is, he's Butterburr's bastard brother, the son ofTed Sandyman and Goldberry."     "And hoo, pray, do I manage tae be a descendant ofIsildur?" inquired Sam.     "It's easy," said Sauron.  "After the destruction ofArthurian, Ar-vegetal, the last king, fled to the Shire,where he sojourned for a time, and wogahed with one of themore bearable... er, lovely hobbit-wenches.  You are his mostdirect descendant.  When I come into my own, you will begiven the realms that should rightly be yours."     "I dinnae believe ye," said Sam, bluntly.     "Very vell," said Shelob.  "Suit yourself.  Don't ruleze Reunited Kingdom and eradicate injustice, usink yourpower to furzer ze Revolution.  Be a good serrvant and helpnice masterr."          "Search within your feelings; you know that what Isay is true.  Besides, would it not be better to be aninstrument of peace between me and Gondor?" urged Sauron."We have rather had our differences over questions likeuniversal healthcare, flush toilets, the relative musicalmerits of 'Casta diva' and 'When you wish upon a star,' andwho should own Dumbar, Land of the Flying Mûmaks. Not tomention the fact that Isildur stole Mini from me..." Onhearing the name "Mini," Shelob stuck a couple of pins intoa female voodoo doll.  Sauron laughed and tickled her bosom.     Sam was impressed.  "Stars and glory!" he cried."Universal healthcare! The Elves could mak a song aboonthat, if they heird of it -" ("And if they had any decentcomposers," murmured Sauron sotto voce.) "In the Shire,"continued Sam, "ye'd be lucky to get a Witch-doctor!"     "Just don't turn out like Gérard in Andrea Chénier,Sam," warned Sauron, nonplussing the hobbits (and possiblyseveral newsgroup posters).     "But does this mean we'll have to turn evil?" whinedFrodo.     Sauron laughed long and merrily.  "Evil?" he repeated."In what does said evil consist?  In providing universalhealthcare?  In being incredibly sexy, albeit in a sinister,Scarpia-like way? I have defended my own realm and itspeople against the genocidal Elven-caciques and Dúnedannarcoterrorists who sought to wipe out the Orcs.  Dogenocide and narcoterrorism not strike you as evil? My goal,on the other hand, is enlightenment and civilization.Indeed, my dream is to spread the glories of bel canto operato every corner of Muddle-earth."  He began to sing anobscure Donizetti aria in a voice of such beauty, thatSpiegel - along with every female Orc in the bulding -swooned, and Shelob began to kiss him passionately while hemassaged her lower and upper extremities.  "Rather thanbeing evil," he added, "I prefer to think of myself asambiguous, polyvalent, indeed intertextual."  He handedFrodo the book entitled Nymphomaniacs and their Ways: APorno-ethics of Existentiality.  "Take it," he said. "It'syours."     "Thank you, father!" said Frodo. "Now could I but wedFroufrou the Fish, I could die happy."     "We'll talk about that after the war," said Sauron."Or at least, after we've gotten rid of the phial. Youaren't really yourself just now, I realize," he sighed.After patting Frodo on the back, Sauron looked thoughtfulfor a moment.     "I did once send a plague of plastic white beagles withblack spots to Gondor, bewritten Get Mordor.  Itpays!" he mused.  "But that was just a prank.  Surely myplans to build an opera house in Minas Mickey prove mybenevolence."     "Sauron, your words are truth!" said Spiegel.  "May Ikeep your Blueprint for a New Order?" she begged.     "Take anything you wish, my sweet," replied Sauron, themellifluous cadences of his baritone filling Spiegel with amysterious thrill - or was it dread? Or was it lust?     Sam was silent for a while, pondering.  "Tell me, whatis Gandalf?" he asked at length.     "The subject is not a very pleasant one," repliedSauron. "In Valinor he got by mainly by cheating at poker,and by various other lies and machinations.  Here in Muddle-earth, his evil deeds continued unabated.  He was in the payof everyone (even me, occasionally; traitors can be useful),got involved in some disgusting genetic experiments which hecarried out on Denethor's wife Clarabella (sometimesrather rudely called 'the Cow'), and generally speaking isthe greatest danger to civilization that exists.  Until hemurdered Aruman, even I had no idea of just how evil he is."The hobbits were filled with horror, and resolved to joinSauron in his glorious struggle against evil.  Even Sam hadno more doubts.     "How can Gandalf be defeated?" asked Spiegel.     "It is difficult," said Sauron gravely.  "As long as hehas the Elf-ring, no power in Muddle-earth - not even mine -can overpower him.  Especially if you throw that ring inMount Viagra..."     "Ve can discuss zis furrzer later," said Shelob. "Veshould be gettink back to Barad-dûr. Zis is not ze safestplace to be discussink zese matters."     "You're right, my little Morgul-flower, whose blossomsunfold like a song of pure ecstasy," replied Sauron, rubbinghis hands all over her body.  "Come, friends!  We have muchto do.  The Morgai situation is getting serious."     Trusting wholly in Sauron and Shelob, the hobbitsgladly complied. As they went, Sauron sang:     Moreador, en garde!     Moreador, Moreador!     I'm a real wiseguy, the great Sauron     and rule the fates of Ard'!     And when we wogah Shelob turns me on,     she really turns me on!The hobbits caught their first glimpse of Mordor.  Sam andFrodo gazed upon the land with a horrible fascination, whileSpiegel looked upon it with understanding and love.  It wasa sight utterly unlike the aristocratically anarchic Shire,with its total lack of any concern whatsoever with a publicsphere independent of the private interests of the landedaristocracy and the rentiers that clung, leech-like, totheir shadow.  Still less did it resemble the tourist-riddensanitized but exploitative and other-denying commercialbanality of Gondor.  But before they could get a clearpicture of what it did resemble, their reveries wereinterrupted by a blast from the past that they could havelived without.     Suddenly they heard a dreadsome song, like unto anexhalation of pure evil, that Frodo and his companionsremembered only too well:     Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadildo!     You're in my way, so I'll have you killed-o!Mingled with this music of iniquity, they heard Boromirwhistling his battle-cry "Hi ho, hi ho!  Our home isNúmenor!" These deadly foes attacked the hobbits in thecompany of evil narcoterrorists.  On hearing the cry "Goons!Hired goons!" Sam lost consciousness from the force of theonslaught, and passed out of all knowledge.
        Sam awakened to find himself in bonds, gagged and tied to a tree.Not far away was Boromir, sharpening his sword and looking around.  Samstruggled against the gag, making unpardonable noises.        "Awake, sirrah?" boomed Boromir.  "'Tis a fair game hast played me.Wilt not try to bite me upon the shank like thy now-unconscious companion,wiltow?"  He pointed toward a similarly trussed Frodo.        Sam shook his head.  Boromir approached and removed the gag,allowing Sam to unleash a torrent of proletarian vituperation.        "Monarchist scum!  Untie me, or you'll live to see Gondor aSocialist Republic, and yourself lined up against the Wall with yourdeluded allies for your just retribution!"  He continued in that vein forquite a while.  Boromir laughed, but a little nervously, and continuedto pace and look through the trees.  They were, Sam guessed, in a glade ofEthelien, with its usual appurtenances of pond and babbling brook,somewhere to the east of Disgiliath.  At least, that was where he thoughthe had been when Sauron and Shelob had taken them Mordor-wards; the memorywas somewhat confused.        "Enough, halfling!" Boromir said after some time.  "I'll notdebate thy strange and decidedly post-medieval political views with thee.Know then, that thou hast been most foully deluded and cozened by the baselies of Sauron."        "Liar!" Sam flung back.  "I know for a fact that you're anarcoterrorist and an accomplice of Gandalf the Gruesome.  And I'mLenindil, the Heir of Isildur!"        "Sam, Sam!" Boromir laughed.  "Listen to thyself!  Wert thounot the champion of freedom from tyranny and exploitation by thearistocrats?  And here art thou claiming meaningless, archaic titles andeven glorying in them?  And associating me with Gandalf?  What next?Know that I have no interest other than that of Gondor and assortedfranchises.  Think about it, Sam.  Think about it."        Sam thought about it.  He thought of Sauron's promises of power.He thought of the Red Flag.  He thought of Annúminas.  He recalled thatAnnúminas was a draughty ruin.  He thought of the warm embraces ofRevolutionary Rosie.  "Kinko... Pinko... Pinko... Kinko..." he mumbled."But what about the opera?  Surely a cultured intellectual like Sauroncouldn't be up to no good..."        Boromir laughed scornfully.  "Opera?  Let me ask you, my goodSam, hast ever heard of Mario Lanza?"  Sam shook his head.  "Well, then,let me assure thee that opera may be Neanderthally lowbrow.  And what has acard-carrying member of the Hobbit Labour Party got to do withintellectuals anyway?"        Sam shook his head.  The lies of Sauron now seemed dull, false, andunbelievable.  He could not understand how he had ever been gulled.  "Verywell," he said slowly.  "I still think yer a right stinkin' monarchistsnob.  But I'll overlook that for now. What about Master, er, Mr. Frodo?"        "Hath babbled for hours about his 'Nurnenshire Estate', 'MoneybagsHall' and all that, until one of my Rangers -- NOT narcoterrorists, by anymeans -- swatted him on the occiput with his hilts.  He's yet more deludedthan thee.  But I'll release him, if you'll take him under your care."        "All right.  I'll be responsible for him."        "The third of your troop hath escaped us.  We broke the Orkishguard that escorted you out of Disgiliath; but in the mêlée your gangrelfriend departed."        "Er, which gangrel friend?"        "I saw but the one.  If there was another, it is doubtless stillwith the Orks."        "What about Sauron and Shelob?  Did they get away?" Sam asked.        "Sauron and Shelob?  Art mad, my friend?  Sauron abideth in theDark Tower in Mordor, hatching his evil plans.  Shelob I know not, but weslew nought but Orks."        "But I saw..." Sam began.  But as he tried to put words to hismemory, it became muddled and fragmented.        "You were deceived by the phantoms of Sauron, no doubt, that emergefrom the spiral depths of Minas Epcot and wend their way up and downEthelien.  Nay, Sauron will not emerge from the Dark Tower until all islost, and the Tower of Commerce is fallen.  But we must away.  The Orkshave only been driven off.  The longer we wait, the sooner they will beupon us.  We shall go down from the Crossroads to below Disgiliath, into aferry I have waiting there, and across the Anduin to Minas Tirith,where thou and thy Master shall be safe.  Arouse him!  For we must go."        Boromir released Sam's bonds, and Sam went over to Frodo.  He had abad bruise on the back of his head, and was breathing heavily.  "Mr. Frodo,Sir!" he called.  "Wake up, its your Sam, your own dear Sam, your dear,dear beloved true-hearted faithful Sam."        Frodo woke with a scream.  "Argh!  My Estates! My Estates!" hecried, and then collapsed back, sobbing.  "Don't let them take my Estatesaway, Sam!"  As Sam freed his legs, he jumped up and tried to run, butBoromir's Rangers blocked the way.        Sam grabbed Frodo's arm.  "We're stuck here, Mr. Frodo, and that'sa fact.  We might as well go with these gentlemen."        Frodo struck Sam's arm away.  "No!  They want my money, they do!My Estates!  My rightfully inherited Estates!  My precious Estates!  Theycan't have them, no indeed, no precious!"  He was panting hard at thispoint, and sweating; his eyes, swollen and reddened, bulged from hissockets.        Boromir growled.  "Thy 'Estates', as thou callest them," he said,"are nought but the merest paper.  There is no 'Nurnenshire'!  'Tis but avast, desolate wasteland!  As thou wouldst have found, had I not freed theefrom the clutches of the Mordor-Orks.  But thou art freed now, and soonshall be safe within the walls of Minas Tirith.        Frodo shivered and looked around him with the gaze of a hunted,cornered animal.  "Lies, all lies," he panted.  "I have Sauron's word onit.  I have the Deed!  Everything comes down to Contracts, and mine issigned and sealed!  It's my Estate, mine I tell you!"  His voice had becomea high-pitched whine.        Sam stepped up to him.  "Oh, Mr. Frodo," he said plaintively, "youcan always come back for your Estate later.  Now just follow these nicemen..."        Frodo spat at him.  "You.  You're in league with them!  Just as Ialways suspected.  Trying to get my money, aren't you.  Nice Sam, good Sam,clever Sam.  Always does what he's told, eh?  And why is Mr. Sam sodevoted?  Because he wants to pick Squire's pockets, that's why!  Dog!Thief!  Gamgee!"        He burst upon Sam with both fists, punching and scratching, whenthe heavy hand of a Ranger came down upon his shoulder and hauled him back.Frodo's teeth sank deep into that hand, and were only released when amailed glove came down upon his head.        "Seest how he is, Sam," said Boromir.  "Here, I think thouhadst better take this; thou shalt be the safer guardian."  He removed theRing from Frodo's neck and passed it to Sam.  But Sam was deep in tears.Frodo had rejected him!  His own, dear, sweet master Frodo had decided thatmoney -- real or imaginary, it mattered not --  meant more to him than dearSam.  Dear faithful Sam.  The ground was soon damp with his sobs.        "We'd best be onward, Lord," quoth a Ranger.  "Orks are a prowling.And where an Ork prowls, there hoot all the owls."        "Aye," said Boromir.  "And it's an ill wind that blows no oneany good."        With that the Orks came crashing through the trees, armed to theteeth with Lugers, Mausers, and all manner of automatic weaponry.  Theyaimed their fire at the tall people (whom they could see), giving Sam achance to hide in a fernbrake and cover the unconscious Frodo over withsome branches.  So Sam saw the whole massacre: Rangers falling or flying,while Boromir fought on with his hopelessly anachronistic sword andshield, until at last he fell with thirty bullets in the chest, and fellback into the pond, which at once turned a gruesome red.  So passedBoromir, best of the house of the Stewards to fail to rule in Gondor.        Sam stayed hidden until the Orks had gone.  The sun set and themoon rose.  Frodo woke, but Sam powered him to the ground and kept his handfirmly over his mouth.  A sound came from out toward the battlefield.        "Head bone connects to de neck bone, yess, neck bone connects tojuicy backbone, yes, backbone connects to scrumptious hip bone, yess, hipbone connects to meaty thigh bone, yum!"        "Gullible!" Sam called softly.  "Is that you?"        "Sss..." came the sibilant answer.  "Is that silly hobbits?  Stillchasing after imaginary Estatess?"        "No, we're over it," Sam replied.  "Or I am, anyway.  I don't knowabout Mr. Frodo. What happened to you?"        "We escapes, we does.  Runs away on fast feet with scampers andpampers!"        "Where's Spiegel?"        "Losst, lost, saddam.  But what does we care?  She betrays uswith Gorbush, precious."        Sam shrugged.  He had always been dubious about two people goingaround saying saddam all the time, and although one was bad enough, hesupposed he could live.  "Well," he said, "we'd better figure out a planfrom here.  We were going to take the Ring to Mt. Viagra, I think..."        "NO!"  The choking scream came from Frodo.  "You can't!  You'llsell us all out to Gandalf!"        "Ss, stupid hobbit," said Gullible.  "He is wrong to want theWogah-ring; steals precious bodily fluids, it does.  It should bedesstroyed!"        "That's two against one, Frodo," Sam replied cheerfully, surprisedto find Gullible on his side in the debate.  "So, are you with us, or do weneed to hogtie you with this excellent elven rope that I managed to bring100 ells of?  I thought I might need it, I did, or I'd be nowt but aninnyhammer, as my Gaffer used to say.  And that's a fact."        Frodo looked at Sam and Gullible hungrily.  A pale light gleamed inhis eyes.  "To Mordor?" he whispered.  "You're going to Mordor?   I cantake you there.  I know the way."  A thin smile played upon his features.        So the three hobbits set forth on the last leg of their journey toMordor.  Before them lay the great mountains of Ethel Duwap, and ahead ofthem the road led to the Enemy's citadel of Minas Goofy.  Minas Ethel longago, the former Tower of the Moonies had once seen mass marriages beyondcount.  But long since the Enemy had occupied it, and the Leech-king'shopelessly amateur tenor had rung throughout the long valley, filling itwith the sound of music.  On the topmost tower of Minas Goofy along-snouted, buck-toothed head topped with a shapeless cap still revolved,leering into the night.  Sam and Gullible stood aghast at the sight, butFrodo, apparently unmoved, pulled them forward.  They came to the bridgethat led into the valley toward the yawning gate of Minas Goofy; and Samfell reeling to his knees, as the sickly sweet scent of cotton candy thatrose from the fields about almost overwhelmed him.  "Not that way!" Frodohissed, and Sam shook off the horror and tottered after him.  They attaineda path that climbed up the side of the valley into the slopes of EthelDuwap.  But as they passed, a weariness as of a thousand exploited workersovercame Sam and Gulible, and they felt the need to rest.        "Not rest here!" said Frodo.  "Eyes can see us.  Must go on, andon, money awaits us, riches and power!"        "All right," said Sam quietly, "I'll try, Master."        But it was too late.  All of a sudden the rocks trembled, and withthe blast of ten thousand sousaphones, floodlights illuminated the wholevalley.  And out of Minas Goofy they came: the Army of Sauron, terribleupon the march.        All that host was clad in scarlet and cream, and there weredrummers, trumpeters, sousaphonists and saxophonists, baton twirlers, flagwavers, and Those who Marched in Step.  Rank upon rank they came forth, andthe Leech-king, brandishing a mighty baton, was at their head.  Frodosmiled, recalling that day long since, when the deed to Moneybags Hall hadbeen handed to him.        And Sam, beholding the red flags waving, thought that perhaps theRevolution had come.  His hand, as if obeying historical necessity, crepttoward the Ring around his neck.  Then his own will stirred, and his handsought and found another thing hidden near his breast: the Little Red Bookthat had been his constant companion on his adventures.  He sighed and benthis head.        'The storm has burst at last,' he thought.  'Now the Sauronitefascists are going to Disgiliath, to fight the Imperialists.  Damn theParty for voting for war credits!  A pox on both their houses.'  But deeperdown he remembered his ancient anti-fascism.        Then he heard Gullible's voice.  "Wake up, Ssam!   They're gone."And indeed the sound of sousaphones was fading down the road, and thefloodlights had been turned out.  Sam arose and, turning from the city ofGoofy, prepared to take the upward road.  Frodo, it seemed, had gone onahead, and now came back.  "Silly hobbits!" he said.  "Must go on, on andon, seek wealth and fame and fortune!"        So they proceeded, step by step.  A long stair lead them high upinto the alpine meadows of Ethel Duwap, where the edelweiss grew andalphorns sounded amidst the snowy peaks.  Up and up they climbed, until atlast, in the dead of night, they could see the horns of the chalet ofCirith Iodel.  A yellow light burned in the window of the chalet.        "Sss!  Tricksy hobbit!" hissed Gullible.  "Frodo cheats us, hedoes!  This way is guarded!"        Frodo shrugged.  "Could be," he said.  "Maybe it's least guarded.Who cares?"        "A long way yet," said Sam mournfully.  "I could use a good restand sleep."        They rested upon an flowered alpine carpet and built a fire andtoasted marshmallows.  The stars shone bright in the sky above them, as Samand Gullible sang old campfire songs that they found they both knew.  Afterthe third chorus of "Up in the Air, Junior Nazgûl," Sam said to Gullible,"You know, you're not such a bad sort after all.  I'll make sure to put ina good word for you when Mr. Frodo finally writes this story."        "And who will read this story, eh precious?" Gullible snickered.        "I don't know.  People will buy anything these days, as my Gafferused to say, bless his apophthegmatic soul.  If nothing else, MinasTirith could make it into a movie.  I'm the hero of course, and you'rethe cute talking animal with big eyes, but we'll need a villain.  Nowwhere's Master Frodo got to?"        They looked around.  Frodo was nowhere to be seen.  Sam sighed.  "Ishould keep a closer eye on him.  But he's got strange fancies these days.Still, we must humor him."        "Ss, no use worrying about him, no precious," said Gullible."Worry about us, yes!"  Sam found Gullible's gaze slightly unnerving, butalso endearing; he assumed that Gullible had moved into Stage #3 of theFive Stages of Sidekicking, i.e. Hero Worship.  "He's gone after hisEstates, yes, that's his whole plan: the Estates for poor Frodo."        "You're a cynic, Gullible," Sam laughed.  "Let's hope for the bestand prepare for the worst.  For all's well that ends better!"        When Frodo returned, he saw Sam and Gullible sleeping, Sam's headin Gullible's lap, Gullible's eyes closed and his hand caressing Sam'shair.  Frodo's shriek woke them both.        "Cheat!" he cried out.  "Wicked Sam cheats on us!  Whateverhappened to Faithful Sam!  And now I see you sleeping with -- yes, I saidsleeping with this wretch, this Gullible!  Nice Sam!  Loving Sam!Precious Sam!  Oooh!  I could just kill you!"        "Sorry," Sam said a bit remorsefully.  "But I wasn't sleeping withGullible, just resting, and he's taken rather a shine to me, so..."        "Don't even start," Frodo said angrily.  "I know the whole story.So it's my fault, is it?  Everything's always my fault.  Always blamepoor Frodo.  Very nice Sam, very nice."        "So where've you been, Frodo?"        "Cheating on you, just like you've been cheating on me."        "Oh well," replied Sam.  "I suppose it's not far from the truth.Well, let's go on.  Come on, Gullible."        "Yes, let's," Frodo said sniffily.  "You and Gullible.  Cheats.But you can't get there without me.  No time for rest.  Come along."        The hobbits climbed the slope, marching as straight as they couldtoward the comforting-looking lights of the chalet.  An easy slope led upbefore them, covered with soft green turf.  Gullible breathed in the sweetalpine air.  "Last one there's a rotten egg!" he cried and set off.  Samwas hot on his heels.  Only a little higher now.  The cleft, Cirith Iodel,was before them, a dim notch in the alpine ridge, and the chalet darklingagainst the sky.  A short race, a sprinter's course, and they would bethere!        But Sam was still digesting the marshmallows (of which he had eatenmost), and Gullible's legs were too fast for him.  As he slowed, panting,he felt a clammy hand over his mouth.  Taken off guard he toppled back intoFrodo's arms.        "Got him!" Frodo said.  "The so-called faithful Sam!  Don't think Ihaven't searched your pockets at night.  'Death to the Aristocrats'!  'Longlive the Revolution!'  We'll see about revolution when I'm esconced inMoneybags Hall.  Did you think you had me fooled?  You're nothing but asanctimonious liberal-leftist petty bourgeois armchair revolutionary. ButI've got you at last, you nasty filthy cheat!"        Armchair revolutionary.  Those words burned a fire in Sam's brainthat overcame his remembered love for Frodo and allowed him to fight back.A heel came up in Frodo's groin, and an elbow in his gut.  Frodo retchedand staggered back.  Sam was on him, punching and stomping.  "Had enough,pig?" he asked after he relented long enough for Frodo to catch his breath.But that was a mistake.        "Hey-yo-ee-oh!  Yo-ee-oh!"  A deafening yodel burst from Frodo'slips.  And out of the sky, rending the air like a butter-knife, came aNazdaq flying upon some strange Fierce Beast.  Frodo leaped up and graspeda claw, and the Nazdaq swooped away with him, leaving only a call thatechoed down the mountainside.  "So long, suckaz!"  Frodo's plot hadsucceeded.        Sam raised his head from the ground, weeping with anger.  Gulliblewas nowhere in sight.  The love for Frodo that had filled him had turned tohatred.  Now, at last, there was a real purpose for his lonely journey intothe land of Mordor.  Vengeance.  If once he could go, his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Frodo.  Then Frodo would die in a corner.  Yes, Sam mused to himself.  This was what he had set out to do.  It might not bring about the Revolution, but it would be uniquely satisfying.        Gullible came creeping back down the slope and found Sam there."Ssam dear," he said, "you'd better look at this."  Sam followed wearily.They came to the top of the ridge, where the chalet stood.        But there was only one wooden wall.  The chalet was a false front,the inviting yellow light seen from a distance just a single candle burningbehind an empty window.  And before them the alpine meadows ended.  On thefar side of the Ethel Duwap, the delightful music-filled glades droppedinto sheer, slaty precipices.  Far below Sam could see the vast parkinglots of the Mall of Gorgoroth and Lithlad Station; their asphalt surfacesstretched to the horizon.  In the gloom, no trace of the Dark Tower orMount Viagra could be seen.  Sam clenched his hands into fists and glaredinto the distance.  Somewhere out there was Frodo: alive, and taken in bythe Enemy.
  Aragon raced up the hill, following the trail of Boromir's blood.  "If I read that sign aright," he said to himself, looking at the largesign pointing at the summit, with "SUMMIT" in large runes written on it,"that is the way to the summit."  He ran up to the summit, not pausing until he reached the top. There hefound the palantir, which was rumoured to have been made by the famed Feenamint Industries Plc. itself. Swiftly he inserted a quarter, and placed his eye to the eyepiece, and started to point the device at the boats, for hesuspected Frodo would be going there.  But even as he sought the boats with the device, a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills, just as Mordred violated his parole in once doing.  "Alas! The horn of Boromir," he said, "Hmm, I suppose I'd better make my way down there. Besides, this is just unartistic anyway."  For although Aragon would be pleased to get Boromir out of the way, it could be, how shall we put it, inconvenient if he was known to be directly responsible.  Unsheathing his sword, and crying Endurit! Endurit! he ran all the waydown the hill again, and crashed through the trees, to find Boromir immobile, and lying against a mediocre tree, his cloven horn beside him.  Aragon knelt beside him and tried to rouse him. But, Boromir did not move.  "Yay!", cheered Aragon, his delight undisguised. "Thus passes the heir ofDenethor, Lord of the Tower of Commerce! One down, two to go!"  "I heard that!" said Boromir, slowly.  "Bother," said Aragon. "But since you're alive, you might as well makeyourself useful. What happened here? What happened to those halflings who were supposed to be guarding you?  And more importantly, where is Arwen?"  "Orcs have taken them," said Boromir, struggling. "Arwen too, I think,"he lied, remembering where Aragon's priorities lay.  "Which way did they go?" asked Aragon.  "Dunno. I passed out," said Boromir. "Blood loss, you see."  Aragon cursed viciously and loudly. Thus it was Lego-lass and Giggly foundhim. Giggly had his axe in hand, and Lego-lass her long knife; all her arrowswere spent.  "Alas!", said Lego-lass, standing well back from Aragon. "I have hunted andslain-"  "Oi!", interjected Giggly. "Don't you mean 'we'?"  "I didn't see you do any slaying, shortarse. Or hunting for that matter."  "Oh yeah? So why do you think there were so many detached Orc heads around the place?"  "It's quite clear that-"  Tiring of this, Aragon drew his sword, and waved it around quite menacingly. "Can I get some attention round here?... Thank you," he said at the sudden and quite expected silence. "Now, Boromir here is dead."  "No I'm not!" objected Boromir.  "Yes you are, you'll be stone dead in a minute," said Aragon, kickingBoromir firmly. "Thanks for your concern," he sarcasmed, "but I am Okay,because I only just got here. But it seems that Arwen has been captured bythe enemy.  We must pursue immediately."  "But what about the halflings?" asked Lego-lass.  "They, too, were captured. Alas, we do not know for certain whether theRing-bearer is with them, but we must assume the worst."  "Yes, Frodo was with them," lied Boromir. "Now will someone help me up?"  "Come, let us go," said Aragon.  "Hadn't we better tend to the fallen first?" asked Lego-lass.  "But we must be swift," said Giggly. "He would not wish us to linger."  "What I want is to be taken to Minas Tirith!" declared Boromir.  "Very well," said Aragon. Although he did not like the delay, it was, perhaps, best to deal with Boromir. "We will lay you in a boat with your weapons and give you to Anduin. Then you shall pass to Disgiliath safely."  "No I won't!" exclaimed Boromir. "There's a waterfall in the way! It's notnavigable."  "Ah, but our boats are from Lorien. They are magical, right? Magical boats can safely go down waterfalls," blustered Aragon. "Well known fact, that," hethen added.  "Indeed," said Lego-lass, vaguely suspecting that Aragon did not know the truth of his words, but not daring to say.  They then turned their attention to the fallen Orcs, looking to scavengewhat they could. Lego-lass took all the undamaged arrows she could find,whilst Giggly collected all the shuriken which had been strangely left underthe orc bodies.  And Aragon did look upon the slain, and he did say, "I don't recognise theuniform of these Orcs," for they had shields with the device of a graspingwhite hand in the centre of a black field, and on the front of their helmetsthey had an S-rune.  "S is for Sauron," said Giggly. "That's not exactly hard to figure out."  "Nay, you idiot!" said Lego-lass, "Sauron does not use the Elf-runes, forhe failed to pay the royalties and we got an injunction, which he got roundby using Dwarf-runes, which the Dwerrowsii were only too happy to sell to him-"  "That's unfair-", shot back Giggly.  "Nor does he permit his right name to be spelt or spoken," said Aragon. "And white is not in his colour-scheme, for it makes it easy to see the dirt.The Orcs in the service of Barad-dur use the sign of the Bloodshot Eye."  He pondered a moment. "It's a bit confusing really. I can't think of any bad guys whose names start with S apart from Sauron."  "Shelob?" suggested Giggly.  "I doubt she'd have an army of Orcs, even if she really does exist. No, Ithink what's happened here is a failed attempt at deception. Obviouslythese are someone else's forces, perhaps Aruman's, but he wants to decieveus into thinking they are Sauron's. But because it was done amateurishly,the deception has failed. Sauron will not be happy if he finds out."  Later, the remainder of the company dragged Boromir to where theyhad left the boats, but found only the destroyed remnants of the boats.  "Alas!" said Aragon. "An ill fate is on us today."  "Orcs. Must be. No-one else would have destroyed the boats," said Giggly.  They retrieved what they could find of their baggage, and then fashioneda crude raft from the boat wreckage. Now, they tied Boromir to this, andmade doubly sure the knots were secure, but first taking the precaution of knocking him cold. Then, they pushed the raft from the shore out into the water and the raft floated south. They watched the raft wane to a dark spot against the golden light, and then the screams started.  "No! You can't do this to me! I'm the Heir to the Stewardship of Gondor,you know! I demand you-".   But he was interrupted by the waterfall. The raft vanished downwards. TheRiver had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was out of the way,at least for the moment.  "And now, we must follow the Orcs, for they have Arwen," said Aragon. "Oh, and the ringbearer," he added.  It was easy to find the trail of the Orcs, for it was littered with crisppackets and chewing gum wrappers.  "No other folk leave such a mess," said Lego-lass. "But the Orcs havean alliance with the Litter Pickers' Union, who are glad of the extra work."  "But although they are messy, they are very fast. We shall have to go withwinged speed to catch up," said Aragon, and ran off as fast as he could, with Lego-lass and Giggly following.
  Merciful Elbereth, is this the end of Little Arwen?  The annoying but loveable Elven Warrior Princess was travellingtowards Gondor, but had lost her way in the marshes of Ment-wash vale. The fog surrounded her from all sides, and with everystep she was in danger of being swallowed by the bog. She hadbeen forced to abandon all her packings, and her strength wasdiminishing quickly. Finally she collapsed on a small isle in themiddle of the marshes. She knew that she could go on no more.The Marshes of Mentwash vale had defeated her.  Then an image came to her mind, like a foresight at the momentof Death; Aragon holding hands with a blond Human-Girl, a tall andwell-equipped one too - with sword and all. And suddenly she felther strength returning. She forced herself to rise and cursed in anancient, forgotten tongue: Tega me borne rosa!  With her newly found determination she continued her dangerousjourney, and soon she came across a great stroke of luck, whichno-one could have expected.  Aragon knew all was lost. He couldn't find the trail of Orcs, andsoon his companions were sure to discover this. After that nobodywould take him seriously ever again.  Who could have guessedtracking would turn out to be so difficult? But there was nothing tobe done. The hills of Emyn Mail had defeated him.  But in his most desperate hour, he came across a great stroke ofluck... Well anyway, he was examining the ground, trying to look ashe knew what he was doing, when:  "Oh, lookie! There are some dead Orcs up ahead," cried Lego-lass.  Aragon sprang to his feet and gazed to the direction Lego-lasswas pointing. And lo! Indeed there was a bunch of dead orcs lyingin a pile. He went forward to investigate, and others followed him.  Five dead orcs lay there, brutally slain, severed limbs and headsspreaded around them. The ground was wet with their dark blood,but there was no telling if the blood had been red earlier.  "What do you think happened here?" said Giggly.  "It looks like there's been a quarrel among Orcs," said Aragon."It's not uncommon among these foul creatures to have flamingdebates about issues like Balrogs wings and it usually ends up tothis. These five are all northern Orcs who claim Balrogs don't havewings. It appears they lost this round."  "Serves them right for speaking such nonsense," declared Lego-lass. Aragon was about to contridict, when Giggly interrupted him.  "Look!" he cried. " A silver magical belt of Elvish fashion like those given to Morrie and Pipsqueak by Galadriel."  "Hmm, the Orcs must have noticed they are fakes. . ."  "Wait! There's a note attached to it," said Lego-lass. "It is amessage from the Hobbits. The handwriting looks like of 7-yearold, so I think it's from Pipsqueak. Listen!                      A Message From The Hobbits       I am writing to you with the courtesy of the Enemy.       We are both alive and well.       We are treated decently.       Food here is delicious and nourishing.       The Orcs are peace-loving and friendly folk, and       their Lord, (S)Aruman only wishes to discuss briefly       about our attitude toward his Subpoena and other issues.       After this, we shall be released at proper time.       DO NOT try to follow us. We're having a good time. Really.       Be also noted that as it was recently decided, at this place,       Balrogs DO have w-       No, I wont write that! You can't make me! No! NO!       AAAARGGHHHHH!!!!  Everyone fell silent for a while. Finally Aragon spoke.  "So, Aruman is behind this as I suspected. Apparently he thinkshis name should be written with S. Old fool!  "But why doesn't the letter say anything about Arwen or the otherHobbits? What evil plot is Aruman hatching?"  "Yes, and why would anyone write AARGGH, instead of saying it?"  "We won't find out by standing here," said Aragon. "Let us hurry!"  Fortunately for Aragon the trail was very clearly marked from thereon, and he had no trouble following it to the top of the hills. This wasthe border wall of Rohan, where the hills of Emyn Mail ended andthe green plains of Riddlemark stretched below them to the edgeof sight. But Aragon looked to the left, where the Off-White Mountainsstood glimmering in the morning sun.  "Gondor! Gondor!" cried Aragon. "I wish that I could visityour night-clubs again in Happy-Hour! Alas, not yet can I relax.            Gondor, Gondor, Gondor!            It's the country where I liked to be.            Between the Mountains and Sea,            So near to Mordor, yet so far from Bree.            Gondor, Gondor, Gondor!            Where the Trading Markets are free.            There's a throne and the Silver Tree,            And maybe a Crown for Me!Now let's go before I change my mind!" he said and turned away.  The ridge upon which they stood went down steeply in front ofthem and Aragon was trying to look for the best place to go down,when a shadow like two wings went pass the sunlight.  "Look!" cried Lego-lass. "A Balrog! A Balrog is flying above us!Ai! Ai!- you know the drill."  "Would you stop that already!" said Aragon. "It was just an Eagle."  "No, no, it was a Balrog, I'm sure of that!" insisted Lego-lass. "Ithad legs and arms and I think it waved at us when it went by. Oh,this is amazing! To tell you the truth, I've sometimes had doubtsabout it, but now I've seen it with my own eyes. A flying Balrog!Oh, what a glorious day!"  Oo-kay. Lego-lass has gone bye-bye, thought Aragon. Whatan ill fortune, and I'm already depressed.  After Lego-lass had calmed down they made their way down thehillside, but halfway down Giggly lost his balance and, trying to get support from the others, he sent the whole threesome rolling down. And so, with a strange suddenness  they came together on the grass of Rohan.  Lego-lass took a deep breath and exhaled. "Everything looks sogree-een," she said, blinking her eyes.  "Now the real Pursuit begins," declared Aragon. "We shall catchthose Orcs, and forever shall our names be remembered amongElves, Humans and Dwerws. Onward, three Predators!"  They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent ofa poor helpless fox, hunted to the pleasure of rich dimwits. Soon,however, they had to stop, for they were terribly out of shape andalready exhausted. Only Lego-lass was as perky as ever.  Aragon breathed heavily. "My lungs are collapsing," he said."I really should quit smoking pipeweed."  "This is a bitter end to all our toil!" said Giggly. "At least I hope it is."  "To toil maybe, but we can always hope that those Orcs run intosome kind of trouble," said Lego-lass. "Look!"  This time there was more then dozen cruelly mutilated Orc-corpseson their path. It looked like many were cut down from behind.  "What do you think, Aragon?" said Lego-lass. "Looks like anotherBalrog-debate."  "Not necessarily," said Aragon. "Orcs have hundreds of undecidedissues to debate and they all can turn into a bloodshed. You know,with some luck these Orcs may yet flame each other extinct. Anyway,I think it's clear that we are not going to reach them in time, so fromnow on we will take things a little more easily."  They went on, this time with no rush. Every now and then more Orc-corpses came their way. Giggly and Lego-lass discovered thatcounting dead Orcs aloud seemed to really irritate Aragon. Whenthey made camp for the night, their bodycount was way over fifty.  In the middle of the night something mighty queer went on. Aragonwas half-asleep, listening to the voices of Lego-lass and Giggly. TheElf-Maid was persisting in something and Giggly was rejecting her, but his objections sounded less and less convincing. Suddenly Aragonseemed to realize that someone was crawling next to him. Then hefelt two soft hands touching him gently. Still not sure if he was awakeor dreaming, he tried weakly to struggle against it, but then he hearda familiar voice whispering softly: "Stop resisting my love, you knowyou want it. And this is such a good spot for a Love Scene."  Aragon wasn't so sure about it, but then he thought, Why not. Theycan always edit it out if need be.  When morning came all was peaceful again. Aragon woke up stillunsure if he had dreamed the whole thing. Then he noticed a curiously sticky feeling in his pants, but it was only a melted candy-bar he had forgotten in his pocket.  Everybody seemed strangely quiet that day, as they walked by thebeautiful but empty golf-courses of Rohan. Both Aragon and Gigglywere concentrating on their inner thoughts and were paying only alittle attention to the outside world.  Giggly was struggling with a major identity crisis. Every now andthen his eyes wandered to the figure of the fair Elf-Maid walking infront of him. Desperately he tried to fight the thoughts coming to hismind.  I am not an Elf-Lover, he kept saying to himself. Am not, am not,am not! It's just the pressure of the journey getting to me. It's likebeing in the sea for many months without a sight of a Lady-Dwarf.It would happen to anyone! I am just like all others, a healthynormal Dwarf-Guy, keen on Dwerrow-lasses. That's right, definitelyright. Beard is sexy, beard is sexy, beard is sexy, oh Oolee lookat those legs!  Who the heck was killing all those Orcs? Aragon was thinking tohimself. Were they really just fighting with themselves? Or wasthere a group of Riders attacking them? And who molested me lastnight, or was it just a dream? The questions kept bouncing aroundhis head, until he came up with a most unsuspected answer. Arwen!What if Boromir had been lying when he said Arwen was capturedtoo? Maybe she came to the camp later and, thinking they had goneto Gondor, followed them. And then she could have found anEagle, willing to give her a lift right here! And with her magic bootsshe could have moved around fast enough to kill the Orcs and thento seduce me last night! That's probably what had happened.  Then he came to his senses and shook his head in despair. Itwas simply too farfetched. Not believable at all! Truth was thatArwen was a helpless prisoner of merciless Orcs without a chanceof escape, and he was equally incapable of helping her. Tearsburned in his eyes, as he walked along without seeing anything.  Only Lego-lass seemed free of all care, walking with a delicategrace over the grasslands, singing softly some less-known Elven-songs about interracial love-affairs.  Two more days went by this way. Nobody came to Aragon at night-time, but dead Orcs still kept blocking the path regulaly. Then, onthe fourth day of their "pursuit", a thunderous roar of galloping hoofsawoke them from their afternoon siesta.  Aragon yawned and streched himself. "Lego-lass, be a dear andcheck out who's coming," he said lazily.  "Well, there seems to be a group of Riders coming our way," saidthe Elf-Maid. "Four scores and seven of them, to be exact. Theyare tall, yellow haired humans and their leader is. . . is. . . Oh,c'mon! This is getting ridiculous!"  The others sprang to their feet. They gazed at the approachinghorsemen, trying to see what had so upset Lego-lass. Soon itbecame obvious to them also.  The Riders formed a circle around the three companions. Thenthe Leader rode forward and halted in front of them.  "Suprised to see me?" she asked.  "Not much, Eowynn," said Aragon. "It should have been clear toeveryone that you were not going to settle for being dropped tosecond place in the upcoming movie."  Eowynn, who by the way was a great-looking, six foot tall blonde,tried to look as innocent as she could.  "I don't know what you're talking about," she said. "There weresome Orcs running around our courses and they needed to betaken care of. I only came because my brother Eonerd was busytrying to get Cable Connection fixed."  "You mean...?"  "Just that! Ever since that horse came back from Gandalf, it'sbeen completely off-line.  "But enough of that. It seems that somebody went up ahead andalready killed most of the Orcs, so I guess I'll have to settle for you.Here! You are illegally tresspassing the Green Fields of Rohan®.Do you have anything to say, before we run you over?"  Giggly stepped forward. "I have something to say to you, Horse-Lady," he said and his dark eyes flashed.  "Well?"  A short pause...  "Please don't kill us! Pleeease! I'll do anything! Did you hear?Anything!"  Eowynn looked at the Dwarf and shivered. "I think I'll pass that,"she said. "Prepare to die!"  "Uh, did I mention that I am Aragon son of Arathon, Elessar theElvenstone and the Heir of Isildur?" said Aragon quickly. "If youshould consider letting us go, I could make it worthwhile to you assoon as I get my Kingdom back."  "Hmm, let's see if we can work out an agreement," said Eowynn.  Eowynn dismounted, and she and Aragon walked a little bit awayfrom the others. Eowynn looked quickly to be sure no-one was closeenough to hear them.  "Can you get me a Green Card?" she said to Aragon. "As a King,you can surely pull a few strings and get it arranged."  "What?!"  "I wanna move to Gondor," Eowynn explained. "I don't wantto spend my whole life, living among these bagpipe-playingrednecks. I am a modern, independent woman and I have otherambitions beside riding around and tending golf-courses. But Ineed the Working-Licence so that I can start my own business inGondor. Can you get me one?"  "Uh, I'm afraid, that's the one thing not even a King can do. ThoseGondorians have strong feelings about immigration. If I tried some-thing like that, I would have Revolution in my hands within a week."  "Then there is no hope for me," said Eowynn bitterly. "Sigh.I might as well ride into battle to seek Death."  "Well, there is one way, of course," said Aragon. "I could arrangeyou a Convenial Marriage with some Gondorian. Then you'd haveno problem getting the Green Card. But first you have to get your-self to Gondor somehow, and that's not going to be easy."  "I guess I could do that," said Eowynn after hesitation. "But it hasto be someone with social status. A Lawyer maybe. Or a Doctor."  "So, it is settled then?" said Aragon.  Eowynn looked intensely at the man standing in front of her. Andsuddenly she could see the great strength and royality that wasconcealed inside his bit overweight and slobbish body, like a V6-engine under the hood of a T-model Ford. She took a hold of hishands, and he felt that she trembled at the touch.  "Why don't you marry me then?" she said, looking deeply in hiseyes. "And not just for cover-up, for I can see that we were meantfor each other. Come with me to the Edoras-City and we can haveour wedding right away."  "Eowynn, you are a beautiful and desirable woman," said Aragoncarefully. "Alas, my heart belongs to another! And since she was aprisoner of those Orcs, we both were pursuing, I must go and seekher."  "But your quest is a hopeless one. If she was with the Orcs, whenwe surrounded the last of them near the Forest, she was probablykilled and burned with the others. Um, sorry about that..."  "Nevertheless, I must see it with my own eyes," said Aragon.  Then something less important came to his mind. "You didn't bychance happen to find a Ring, did you? A nice golden thing, on achain. No, huh? Oh, it was nothing important."  "I am saddened by this," said Eowynn. "But if this is your choice,I will accept it. But promise me, that you will come to Edoras-City,when your quest is over."  Thus agreeing they parted. As a part of their agreement Eowynnlent them the three spare horses, but for some reason Lego-lass and Giggly wanted to ride on a same horse. They took thethird one along anyway, for Arwen and the Hobbits (should they find them).  When the Riders had disappeared from the sight, Giggly andLego-lass wanted to know how Aragon had been able to convinceEowynn to let them go.  "Well, it wasn't easy," said Aragon modestly. "But when I said toher that Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear and it's aman's part to discern them, she was so impressed that she agreedto everything I suggested."  This made everybody laugh out loud, as they rode forward in abright daylight, and Aragon was happy that he managed to avoidany further inquires.  Early that evening, they came to the edge of the forest. They foundthe remains of the great burning, and tried searching for the Ring inthe ashes, but found nothing. Also, not a single trace could tell themif anyone could have escaped from the battlefield, but we mustremember that Aragon was lousy at woodcraft.  Aragon was heartbroken. Arwen is dead, he thought hopelessly.And even though she may one day reincarnate in the West, I willnever see her again. It seemed like all the joy and happiness hadleft his life, and all that remained was Misery.  Then he remembered Eowynn. She was a good-looking babe, andshe obviously got the hots for him. Maybe all was not lost after all.  "Tomorrow we shall ride to Edoras-City," he said to others."I have an Indecent Proposal to be made."  But during the night their horses were stolen or driven away.Suspicions turned to an Old Man, whom they had seen snoopingaround the camp, and whom Aragon had called "Uncle".
   Pipsqueak lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that hecould hear his own small annoying voice echoing in black tunnels,calling "Frodo, Frodo! Gimme that biscuit!" But instead of Frodohundreds of hideous, nasty, mean and vicious goblin-faces grinned athim out of the shadows, displaying bridgework that made him cringe.Where was Morrie (and his dentist's drill) when you needed him?   He woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Eveningwas coming and the sky was growing dim. He turned and found that thedream was little worse than the waking, except that he had shut up. Hiswrists, legs and ankles were tied with string. Beside him Morrie lay,asleep, with a knotted handkerchief over his face to keep the fliesoff. All about them sat or stood a great company of goblins.   Slowly in Pipsqueak's aching head memory pieced itself together andbecame separated from dream-shadow. Of course: he and Morrie had runoff into the woods leaving Boromir to the goblins; they had run a long way screaming  he could not remember how far or how long, his mindhaving blanked out that rather embarrassing detail; and then suddenlythey had crashed into the same group of goblins, having described aperfect circle: they were standing listening to Boromir play his horn,several beating a syncopated rhythm on nearby trees and swayingappreciatively to the mellow tones. The goblins did not appear to seehim or Morrie until they had drawn their swords and given five of themBywater smiles*. Then they yelled and dozens of other goblins hadsprung out of the trees (literally), but they did not wish to fight,and only tried to stop the hobbits from killing any more by grabbinghold of them, even when Morrie drew a miniature repeating crossbow fromhis waistcoat and started shooting them in certain parts. Good oldMorrie!   Then Boromir finished the jazz number and started playing one ofSchoenberg's lesser-known works: this slew many of them and the restfled. But they had not gone very far on the way back when they wereattacked again, by a hundred music critics at least, some of them veryscathing, and they hurled an acid rain of sarcastic reviews: always atBoromir. Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and atfirst the critics had been deafened and had drawn back; but when noanswer but the echoes came, they knew they had no full orchestra tocontend with and attacked more fiercely than ever. Pipsqueak did notremember much more. His last memory was of Boromir leaning against atree, muttering something about them all regretting it when his debutalbum was released; then darkness fell suddenly.   "I suppose I was knocked on the head," he said to himself. "KnowingMorrie, I doubt he got hurt. What has happened to Boromir? Why didn't the goblins try to kill us? Why am I here? What is 2+2?"   He could not answer the questions. He felt cold, sick, stupid andhungry. "I wish Gandalf had never persuaded El Rond to let us come," hethought. "What good have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, amessenger, a mariner that should have tarried in Arvernien, a piece ofluggage. And now I have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggagefor the goblins. I wonder if I'm insured? I hope Strider or someonewill come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't he just cashin on the policy and forget about us? I wish I could think of a lessdepressing metaphor!"   He struggled a little, quite uselessly. Whoever had tied this stringwas an expert with ligatures (which made him think of Sam and hisfamily's skill with rope, something that had proved especially usefulto the Bywater lynch mob when they strung up three Shiriffs who were inthe pay of the Grumbleguts family), and also knew that he was about asstrong as Bree-land lager. One of the goblins sitting near laughed andsaid something to Morrie in an abominable accent with ridiculous-sounding vowels; Morrie chuckled sleepily. "Rest while you can, youfrightful little oik," he said then to Pipsqueak in the Common Speech,which he still managed to to make almost as bizarre as his ownlanguage. "Rest while you can! We'll find a use for your feeble littlelegs before long. You'll wish you had none before we get back to Tower.Not used to a brisk cross-country run, I expect."   "If I had my way, you'd wish you were expelled now," said theother. "I'd make you squeak, you pathetic squib." He stooped overPipsqueak, bringing his yellow, uneven fangs close to his face. He worea purple tie with a crest on it, and had a cane with a long, whiplikeswitch in his hand. "Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this," hehissed. "Don't draw attention to yourself and disturb your betters, orI may forget my orders. Curse the Guards! Cedríc in glasshouse thebootless Aruman-tick handman blood..." he passed into a long angry speechin his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.   Terrified Pipsqueak lay still, though the pain in his head and bladderwas growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. Totake his mind off himself he listened intently to all he could hear.There were many voices round about, and though goblin-speech sounded atall times full of hate and argot, it seemed plain that something like aquarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.   To Pipsqueak's surprise he found that much of the talk wasintelligible; many of the goblins were using ordinary language.Apparently the members of two or three quite different schools werepresent, and they could not understand one another's clique-speech.There was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: whichway they were to take and what should be done with the "new boy".   "There's no time to initiate him properly," said one. "No time fortradition on this trip."   "That can't be helped," said another. "But why not enrol him quick,enrol him now? We're in a hurry. Evening's coming, and we ought to geta move on if we don't want to lose house points and face the Run."   "Orders," said a third voice in a deep growl. "Kill all but not theHalflings; they are to brought back uninitiated as quickly as possiblefor extra credit. That's my orders."   "What are they wanted for?" asked several voices. "Why uninitiated?Are they good at sport?"   "Not likely: they look about as promising as Johnson minor. I heardthat one of them has got something, something that's wanted for theSeason, some elvish plot or other. Anyway, they'll both be interviewed."   "Is that all you know? Why don't we search them and find out? We might find something that we could use ourselves: some drinks, or someweed, or something like that."   "That is a very interesting remark," sneered a voice, softer than the others but more evil. "I may have to report that. The new pupilsare not to be searched or molested: those are my orders."   "And mine too," said the deep voice. "Alive and as recruited. That'smy orders."   "Not our orders!" said one of the earlier voices. "We have come allthe way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our shocking loss on points.I wish to kill, then go up north."   "Then you can wish again," said the growling voice. "I am Cedríc. Iam the senior prefect. I return to Guard School by the shortest road."   "Is Aruman the headmaster or the Great Eye?" said the evil voice."We should go back at once to Tower."   "If we could cross the Great River, we might," said another voice."But there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges, and thesenew boys won't have got their Swimming colours yet."   "I came across," said the evil voice. "A winged Nazdaq awaits usnorthward at the East Bank; he's just calling in a few of Pater'sdebts."   "Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with the new pupils, and get allthe kudos and house points for Tower, and leave us to hike as best as wecan through the golf-country. No, we must stick together. These landsare dangerous: full of foul parvenus and new money with no form."   "Yah, we must stick together," growled Cedríc. "I don't trust youlittle Mines House swine. You've no standards outside your own sties.But for us you'd all have run away. We are the Uruk-Hai prefects! Wedestroyed the confidence of the great musician. We recruited the newboys. We are the pupils of Aruman the Wise, the White Hand Gang. Wecame out of Guard House and led you here, and we shall lead you back bythe way we choose. I am Cedríc. I have spoken."   "You have spoken more than enough, Cedríc," sneered the evil voice."I wonder how the masters would like it in Tower. They might think thatCedríc's neck needed relieving of a prefect tie. They might ask wherehis strange ideas come from. Did they come from Aruman, perhaps? Whodoes he think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white Housebadges? They might agree with me, with Clarénce their trusted bridgeclub secretary; and I Clarénce say this: Aruman is a fool, and a dirtytreacherous fool. But the Head has his Eye on him.   "Swine, is it? How do you boys like being called swine by the muck-rakers of a dirty little Chem master?"   Many loud yells in goblin-argot answered him, and the whisperingswish of canes being brandished. Cautiously Pipsqueak rolled over,hoping to see what would happen. His guards had gone to join in the fray.In the twilight he saw a large goblin, probably Cedríc, standing facingClarénce, a short crook-legged creature with no chin. Round them weremany smaller goblins. Pipsqueak supposed that these were the ones fromthe North. They had drawn their canes and wet towels, but hesitated toattack Cedríc.   Cedríc shouted, and a number of goblins of nearly his own size ran up.Then suddenly, without warning, Cedríc sprang forwards, and with twoswift strokes caned the hands of two of his opponents. Clarénce steppedaside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way.   "Boys, put those canes away or I'll thrash you," snarled Cedríc. "Andlet's have no more nonsense! We go straight west from here, and downthe stair. From there to the downs, then along the river to the forest,then three laps around the playing field. Along the Cadet TrainingCourse and back to Guard House in time for prep. That clear?"   The goblins were getting ready to begin the cross-country run again, but some of the Northerners were still unwilling, and the Guardsprefects caned two more before the rest were cowed. There was muchconfusion. For the moment Pipsqueak was unwatched. His legs weresecurely bound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and hislegs were in front of him. He could move them both together, though thebonds were cruelly tight. He tried gnawing through the string, thenremembered the knife that Morrie had convinced him to wear up hissleeve "just in case". He waved his arms in what he hoped was aninconspicuous, I've-got-cramp sort of way until the tiny blade workedloose from its sheath: the edge snicked his arm, and then slid down hiswrist. Pipsqueak whimpered: he hated the sight of blood, particularlyhis own, but steeling himself he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up anddown against the blade of the knife. The string was cut! QuicklyPipsqueak took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loosebracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. Then he lay verystill.   "Pick up those new boys!" shouted Cedríc. "Don't play any tricks withthem! If they are not in alive when we get back, it'll be detentionsand the glasshouse all round till someone owns up. Remember the goodname of your House and school."   A goblin seized Pipsqueak like a sack, tied a horrid brown tie roundhis neck, grabbed his arms and forced him into a disgusting greenblazer with gold piping; then it gave him a good kick "for your owngood, you detestable midget" and picked him up by the ears while othersswished canes meaningfully. Morrie yawned, got up and put on theuniform with every appearance of enthusiasm; the goblins were almostdeferential to him. Pipsqueak looked at Morrie in horror, as hesuddenly realised who must have hit him over the head, and tied thoseknowingly mocking knots. Morrie glanced at him, and smirked. Pipsqueakshut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams. Most of them involvedMorrie and sharp implements.   Suddenly he was thrown onto the stony floor again. It was early night,but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edgeof a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was asound of water falling nearby.   "The scouts have come back at last," said a goblin close out hand.   "What a relief," hissed another, and the sound of water ceased.   "Well, what did you discover?" growled the voice of Cedríc.   "We had to destroy a couple of villages to get them, sir, but we'vegot enough feather beds for the senior prefects, and breakfast for theentire cross-country party. All's well now."   "Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have kept a few of the yokels alive to carry the beds for us. Now we'll just have toleave them here. Damn you all to hell!"   "Yes, sir," said the scout.   A shadow bent over Pipsqueak. It belonged to Cedríc. "Sit up!" saidthe prefect. "My bloods are tired of lugging you about. We have got toclimb down, and you must use your legs. Be a man now. No crying, noslacking, follow the principles that have made Guard House old boysgreat. Let's see if you make the grade in one of our smaller tests,shall we?"   He cut the string round Pipsqueak's legs and ankles, picked him up by his ears and stood him on his feet. Pipsqueak fell down, and Cedrícdragged him up by his ears again. Morrie laughed. Cedríc thrust a flaskbetween his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat, whilethe goblins chanted, "Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!" Pipsqueak managed todrain the whole bottle, and the goblins cheered. Cedríc lookedimpressed. Pipsqueak felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. The painin his legs and ankles vanished. He could stand, although walking in astraight line proved surprisingly difficult.   "Where's mine?" Morrie demanded. Cedríc glowered and looked about todraw his cane, then thought better of it and signalled for anotherflask. Morrie looked him in the eye, then unstoppered it and positivelyguzzled the contents. The goblins were flabbergasted. "These Halflingsare damned good drinkers, I'll say that for them," one of themmuttered, sipping gingerly at an alcopop.   Morrie stood up, looking calm and relaxed, as though being proffereddrinks by goblins was nothing out of the ordinary. "Where do we get bedand breakfast?" he demanded.   "Do I look like a scout?" Cedríc snapped. "Ask them, it's none of mybusiness."   "Suit yourself," Morrie said languidly. "But I don't expect my fatherwill be very pleased once he hears that I haven't been treated well.Why, he may even choose to withdraw his generous donation to the GuardHouse trust fund"   Pipsqueak could hardly believe his ears (which were now throbbing andapproximately three times as big as they had been at the start ofthe "cross-country run"). Morrie's father was notoriously tight-fisted(he was known as Sorrowduck Snatchgold, or "Sorrie" for short) and inaddition had not been seen by anyone outside his family for threeyears: Gaffer Gamgee had voiced a commonly-held opinion that "youngmaster Morrie" had been rather previous in assuming control of thehousehold, resigning himself to the notion with the phlegmaticobservation that "it won't matter one whit when the Revolution comes,you mark my words". Yet here was Morrie using his father's allegedmunificence as a bargaining tool with the creatures of the Enemy, andgetting away with it! He watched Cedríc back down with a mutteredapology and a summons to the nearest scout to give "Mister Brandybuck"all the information he wanted. The scout promised obsequiouslythat "you'll get bed and breakfast all right, sir, more than you canmanage."   "I doubt that," Pipsqueak said out loud, and was caned for speakingout of turn.   The party began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the mistyplain below. Morrie and Pipsqueak, separated by a dozen or more smallergoblins who were busily toadying up to the new boy who could cheekCedríc the Guard blood and get away with it, climbed down with them. Atthe bottom they stepped onto grass, and Pipsqueak's heart rose; hecould feel the fine-trimmed green of a golf course of Rohan under hisfeet, and he remembered the old story about Bandyknees the Bullshitterand King Golfball the goblin, drawing confidence from the connexionwith the hobbit who walked off with the first Masters trophy with astaggering 61. He then remembered that the Bullshitter had been lynchedby a distinctly biased crowd, and that Golfball had given his name tothe sport for a very good reason, and suddenly felt a lot colder.   "Now straight on!" shouted Cedríc. "West and a little north. FollowEustáce. Let's trample their precious golf courses a little, that'll bea good prank, eh boys?"   "But what are we going to do at sunrise?" some of the northernersasked.   "We shall sing the school song, give three cheers for the Headmasterand Aruman his Deputy, and cane Plowman Minimus for picking his noseand eating it when he thought no-one was looking," Cedríc repliedpromptly; Pipsqueak could see how he had ended up as seniorprefect. "Then go on running. What do you think? Sit on the green andwait for the nouveaux riches to tee off?"   "But we can't run in the sunlight; we have allergies, and sick-notesfrom our parents."   "You'll run with me behind you, you loathsome slugs," saidCedríc. "Allergies? You pathetic frogspawn make me sick, with yourexcuses and your weak chests and your heart conditions. No wonder GuardHouse has thrashed you in every game of rugger for the last eighteenseasons. You're not fit to wear those ties, you hear me? Now get out ofmy sight. Allergies, my foot!" He raised the aforementioned extremityand booted the nearest northerner into a bunker. It was then thatPipsqueak noticed that, like hobbits, the Guards pupils wore no shoes,and that their feet extruded little studs, and were toeless, beingfitted with steel toecaps instead.   Then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides ofgoblins. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling and cursing; severalgoblins got studded in the confusion, and elbows were used withoutmercy. This was clearly an important run, as the prefects from eachhouse went up and down the line, beating those among their fellows whocould not match the pace. Pipsqueak, who was far back in the linehiding among a group of no-hopers and hoping that Cedríc would not spothim, gathered that an important trophy was at stake. He could not seeMorrie. He wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace; hehad had no food since the morning. But at present the goblin-liquor("ghash-water" as they called it) was still hot in him.   Every now and again there came into his mind an unbidden vision of thefat face of Strider bending myopically over a dark trail, and waddling,waddling behind. More vivid, however, was the image of the giganticfive-headed hamster waving a sickle and singing "My Balrog lies overthe ocean" out of tune, and he began to sweat profusely and shiver atthe thought of its evil little eyes and its malicious whiskers.   They had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the course slopeddown into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet:the goblins busied themselves knocking down the boundary fence. Thedark shapes of the goblins in front grew dim, and several wereswallowed up.   "Damn it all! Quicksand!" shouted Cedríc from the rear.   Pipsqueak could stand it no more. If the quicksand did not swallowhim up, the mutant hamster certainly would. He swerved aside to theright, and fell headfirst into the mist. "Come back here, you snivellinglittle toerag!" Cedríc roared.   Pipsqueak sprang up and ran screaming, divesting himself of hisclothes as he ran.   "This'll shake that monster off the scent a little!" he reasoned. Hetore off his tie and blazer, then threw away his waistcoat and undidhis silver belt, which began to deliver a tinny rendition of "Happybirthday to you" in Elvish. He moved to take off his trousers, but longarms and hard claws seized him and he came to his senses.   Strangely the goblins refrained from punishing him, and he foundhimself regarded with a degree of awe by the northerners; even theGuards left him alone.   "I don't know why I did it," he whispered to Morrie, who was nowjogging next to him. "It seemed to make sense at the time."   "You've got guts, I'll say that for you," Morrie replied. "Eitherthat or you're even dafter than I thought. Haven't you heard anythingabout public schoolboys? Still, I imagine they'll leave you alone fornow. I may make a Took of you yet, cousin!"   "What do you mean?" Pipsqueak demanded. Morrie smiled, but saidnothing.   Neither Pipsqueak nor Morrie remembered much of the latter part ofthe journey, since they were treated to copious quantities of Ghash-waterby their fellow runners. They veered, and zigzagged, and fell over, butif they halted or stumbled they were picked up and carried by thenortherners, who had unofficially adopted them. The Guards prefectsscowled, but said nothing. There was still no sign of Clarénce.   The warmth of the latest flask had gone, and Pipsqueak was sick again.Suddenly he fell face downwards on the turf. An hour and a half later,the company noticed he was missing and sent a party back to retrievehim. Whatever kudos his panicked streaking had won him evaporated; hewas carried in a sack and darkness was about him.   "I'm suffocating in here!" he yelled, but to no avail.   Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: many of the more unfitgoblins were demanding a rest. Cedríc was shouting. He felt himselfflung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, until black dreams tookhim. At three in the morning the company was woken by cries of "Clownsare climbing through the window!" and an irate prefect kicked the sackuntil Pipsqueak was silent once more.   Slowly he came back to the waking world with a bleeding nose andbruised ribs. Orders were shouted (he heard Morrie bellow "Ten baconsandwiches!") and he was tipped out and thrown roughly on the grass.There he lay for a while, fighting with nausea. His head swam, but fromthe heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught.His vision blurred. A scout stooped over him and flung him some breadwith a strange, oddly-coloured circle of meat in the middle. He ate thesesame seed bun hungrily, but not the meat: he was famished, but notyet so famished as to eat a hamburger, the flesh of he dared not guesswhat creature.   He sat up and looked about. Morrie was not far away. They were by thebanks of a swift narrow river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak wascatching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on thelower slopes before them. There was no sign of any giant hamsters.   There was much shouting and debating among the goblins; a quarrelseemed on the point of breaking out again between the northerners andthe Guards. Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointingeastwards. One was pointing up in the air, but he was caned anddesisted.   "Very well," said Cedríc. "Leave them to me then! If you want tothrow away what we've come all the way to get, throw it away! I'll lookafter it. Let the Uruk-Hai look after it, as usual. If you're afraid ofthe Whiteballs, run! Run! There's the forest," he shouted, pointingahead. "Get to it! It's your best hope: it's out of bounds. Off you go!And quick, before I knock a few more teeth in, to put some sense intothe others." No-one appeared to understand the last part, but they saidnothing.   There was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the northernersbroke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly alongthe river towards the mountains and showing more athletic prowess thanthey had demonstrated in the entire journey up to that point. Thehobbits were left with the Guard House contingent: a grim dark band,four score at least of large, muscular, bone-headed jocks with greatcanes and short tempers. A few of the larger and bolder northernersremained with them.   "Now we'll deal with that little rat Clarénce," said Cedríc; but someeven of his fellow Guards were looking uneasily southwards.   "I know," growled Cedríc. "The cursed polo-players have got wind ofus. But that's all your fault, Jeffries. You and the other scouts oughtto have your wages docked. But we are the prefects. We'll feast onhorseflesh yet, or something better. Filet mignon would suit me, but Isuppose we'll have to see what's on High Table."   At that moment Pipsqueak saw why some of the troop had been pointingeastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries, and therewas Clarénce again, and at his back a couple of score of others likehim: long-limbed chinless goblins. They had a red eye on their prefectbadges. Cedríc stepped forward to meet them.   "So you've come back?" he said. "Thought better of it, eh?"   "I've returned to see that Orders are carried out and the new boyssafe," answered Clarénce.   "Indeed!" said Cedríc. "Waste of effort. I'll see that orders arecarried out in my prefecture. And what else did you come back for? Youwent in a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?"   "I left a fool," snarled Clarénce. "But there were some stout fellowswith him who were too good to lose, especially if that cricket rematchagainst Gundabad hasn't been cancelled. I knew you'd lead them into amess. I've come to help them."   "Splendid!" laughed Cedríc. "But unless you've some guts for a scrapwith the hoi polloi you've taken the wrong way. Tower was your road.The Whiteballs are coming. What's happened to your precious Nazdaq? Hashe had another mount impounded by the police for speeding? Now, ifyou'd brought him along, that might have been useful  if these Nazdaqare all they make out."   "Nazdaq, Nazdaq," said Clarénce, shivering and licking his chops, asif the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. "You speak ofwhat is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Cedríc," hesaid. "Nazdaq! Ah! All that they make out! One day you'll wish that youhad not said that. Ape!" he snarled fiercely. "You ought to know thatthey're the apple of the Great Eye, you numbskull, but you clearlyhaven't done your Evil Economic Forces prep yet. But the winged Nazdaq:not yet, not yet. He won't let them show themselves across the GreatRiver yet, not before they've got their pilot's licences. They're forthe Season  and other purposes, such as sky-writing."   "You seem to know a lot," said Cedríc. "More than is good for you, Iguess. Perhaps those in Tower might wonder how, and why, not to mentionwho, when, where and what. But in the meantime the Uruk-Hai of GuardHouse can do the dirty work, as usual. Don't stand slavering there! Forheaven's sake get a handkerchief or something. You make me feel quitefaint. The other swine are legging it to the forest, and you'd betterfollow. You wouldn't get back to the Great River alive. Right off themark! Now! I'll be on your heels, and that," he stamped on a smallrock, which shattered completely, "will hurt."   The Guards seized Pipsqueak and Morrie, much to the indignation of thelatter, who shouted something about his father. Then the troop startedoff. Hour after hour they ran, slinging the hobbits from one carrier toanother, while others tried to tackle them. "No point wasting time thatcan be used for rugger practice," Cedríc boomed. The Guards graduallypassed through the Tower party, and soon they were gaining on thenortherners as well. The forest began to draw nearer.   Pipsqueak was bruised, torn, hung over and miserable. "Is this what allpublic schools are like?" he thought to himself. His father had put hisname down for Dunharrow-on-the-Hill, but Pipsqueak had run away when hefound out. Morrie, of course, had been to Wood Eaton; Pipsqueaksupposed that he had learned his unquenchable self-confidence andbrutal habits there. Much good was it doing him now, though, beingthrown from one set of iron hands to another. This brought Pipsqueaksome consolation, until a penalty was declared and he was kicked fiftyyards through the air and bounced a further fifteen.   In the afternoon Cedríc's troop overtook the northerners. They weresneezing in the rays of the bright sun; their heads were down and theirtongues were lolling out. One of them was searching for his antihistaminespray.   "Maggots!" jeered the Guards. "You're cooked. The Whiteballs willcatch you and kill you. They're coming!"   A cry from Clarénce showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen,riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind butgaining on the goblins. They were waving polo mallets in the air.   The Guards began to run with a redoubled pace that astonishedPipsqueak, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then hesaw that the sun was sinking; shadows reached over the land. The Towercontingent lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. Theforest was dark and close. The land was beginning to slope upwards, butthe goblins did not halt. Both Cedríc and Clarénce shouted, spurringthem on to a last effort.   "They will make it yet. They will escape," thought Pipsqueak intypically optimistic mood. Then his latest carrier managed to twist hisneck, so that he ended up (in severe pain) glancing back over hisshoulder. He saw that the riders away eastward were already level withthe goblins, galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their ridinghelmets and mallets. They were hemming the goblins in, preventing themfrom scattering, and driving them along the line of the river.He wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished now thathe had learned more at Rivendell, or indeed anywhere at all, and lookedmore at maps and books and things; but in those days the plans for thejourney seemed to be in more competent hands, namely those of everyoneelse, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, orfrom Strider, or Frodo, or Boromir, or... All that he could rememberabout Rohan was that it was called Rohan. All things considered, thatwas not very much help. But better than nothing, as far as it went.   "But how will they know that we are not goblins?" he thought, lookingat Morrie's wicked and sly face, and the uniform that they had oncemore forced him to wear. "I don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbitsdown here, and if they have they probably want to kill us anywaybecause of our criminal network. I suppose I should be glad that thebeastly goblins look like being destroyed, but that isn't really muchconsolation is it?"   A few of the riders appeared to be golfers, judging from the squiresriding beside them bearing club-filled bags. Riding swiftly into rangeand then dismounting, they hit volleys of white balls (Pipsqueak wasstrangely relieved when he made the connexion) and the goblins thatstraggled behind, coughing and wheezing. Several of them fell, althoughgiven their level of fitness they were probably having heart attacks;then the riders wheeled out of range of the answering ink-pellets andpaper aeroplanes of their enemies, who aimed wildly, not daring tohalt. This happened many times, and on one occasion balls fell amongthe Guards. One of them, just in front of Pipsqueak, got hit in thetemple and did not get up again.   Night came down without the riders closing in for battle. Manygoblins had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darknessthe goblins came to a hillock, but did not know whether to eat it or talkto it, and so left it alone. The eaves of the forest were very near,probably no more than three furlongs away, but Pipsqueak didn't knowhow long a furlong was, so that wasn't very helpful. The horsemen hadencircled them. A small band disobeyed Cedríc's command, and beganplaying a vigorous march, until they were caned into submission.   "Well, here we are," sneered Clarénce. "Fine leadership! I hope thegreat Cedríc will lead us out again."   "Put those halflings down!" ordered Cedríc, taking no notice ofClarénce. "You, Eustáce, get two others and stand guard over them!They're not to be killed unless the filthy Whiteballs break through.Understand? As long as I'm alive, I want 'em. But they're not to cryout, and they're not to be rescued. We were entrusted to being the newboys back to Guard House, and that's what we're going to do, whetherthey like it or not. Bind their legs!"   The last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pipsqueakfound that for the first time he was close to Morrie. The goblins weremaking a great deal of noise, shouting and swishing their canes, andthe hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.   "Get your hands off my neck!" Morrie croaked. "I'll have you dumpedin the swamp with concrete shoes."   "Hobbits don't wear shoes!" Pipsqueak replied instinctively.   "A concrete waistcoat, then. Leave off!"   Pipsqueak let go. Morrie coughed for a while, then hissed: "What didyou expect? Look out for number one is my motto. They said they werethere to recruit us into their school, and they seemed to think thattying you up was an appropriate initiation ritual. That's publicschoolboys for you. Anyway, I need to get to Isengard quickly, and thisseemed like a good idea."   "Isengard? Are you mad?"   "On the contrary, Isengard is the only reason I joined this stupidexpedition in the first place. Do I look like the altruistic type? Dome a favour. Remember when my cousins Norbert and Clovis were found inthe Woody End riddled with holes? That was Sackville-Baggins work.Young Lotho is getting some new kind of weapon shipped in from Isengardin return for some high-quality weed, and I need to close it downbefore we lose our investments in the Southfarthing completely."   "You are mad. You've travelled halfway across the continent, just toshut down a weapons smuggling operation? Well anyway, that's all verywell, but why am I here?"   Just then, however, a savage kick warned Pipsqueak that the noise haddied down, and the Guards were watchful.   The night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the goblinswere gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness,a complete ring of them.   "There is nothing between me and the wheel of fire," Pipsqueak thought.They were within a long bowshot, but the goblins had no longbows. Theriders made no sound. Later in the night when the moon came out of themist, then they could occasionally be seen.   "They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!" growled one of the Guards."Why don't we get together and charge through? What's old Cedríc thinkhe's doing, I should like to know?"   "I daresay you would," snarled Cedríc stepping up from behind."Meaning I don't think at all, eh? That's five hours' detention for you,Harrison. You're just as bad as the other rabble: the maggots and theapes of Tower. No good trying to charge with them: they'd just squealand bolt, and there are more than enough of these filthy middle-classfools to mop up our lot on the flat. Still, there's one thing thesefine fellows don't know: Mauríce and his lads are in the forest, andthey should turn up any time now."   Cedríc's words were apparently enough to satisfy the Guards; but theother goblins were both dispirited and rebellious. They posted a fewwatchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasantdarkness. It did indeed become very dark: the fires brought no light tothe hillock, whatever it was. The riders were not, however, contentmerely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcryon the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. Itseemed that some of the men had riden in close, slipped off theirhorses, crawled to the edge of the camp and beaten several goblins todeath with their one-irons before fading away again. Cedríc dashed offto stop a stampede.   Pipsqueak and Morrie sat up. The Guards had gone with Cedríc. But ifthe hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed. A long hairyarm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together, Dimlythey were aware of Clarénce's great head and hideous lack of chinbetween them. He began to paw them and feel them. Pipsqueak shudderedas hard cold fingers groped down his front.   "Well, my little ones!" said Clarénce in a soft whisper. "Enjoyingyour nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps; canes andtowels on one side, and nasty mallets on the other! Little people shouldnot meddle in affairs that are too big for them." His fingers continued togrope. There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.   The thought came suddenly into Pipsqueak's mind, as if caught directfrom the urgent thought of the enemy: "Clarénce knows about the Ring!He's looking for it, while Cedríc is busy: he probably wants it forhimself. Good heavens, I hope that's what he's after." Cold fear was inPipsqueak's heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use hecould make of Clarénce's desire.   "I don't think you will find it that way," he whispered. "It isn'teasy to find."   "Find it?" said Clarénce: his fingers stopped crawling, much toPipsqueak's relief, and gripped his shoulder. "Find what? What are youtalking about, little one?"   "For a moment Pipsqueak was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness hemade a noise in his throat: saddam, saddam. "Nothing, my precious," headded, for good measure.   The hobbits felt Clarénce's fingers twitch. "O ho!" hissed the goblinsoftly. "So that's what he means, is it? Very ve-ry dangerous, mylittle ones."   "Perhaps," said Morrie, now alert and aware of Pipsqueak's guess."Perhaps, and not only for us. Still you know your own business best.Do you want it, or not? And what you give for it?"   "Do I want it? Do I want it?" said Clarénce as if puzzled; but hisarms were trembling. "What would I give for it? What do you mean?"   "We mean," said Pipsqueak, choosing his words carefully, "that it'sno good groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But youmust untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing and tell all."   "My dear tender little fools," hissed Clarénce, "everything you have,and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time:everything! You'll wish there was more you could do to satisfy theQuestioner, indeed you will: quite soon. We shan't hurry theexperience. Oh dear no! What do you think you've been kept alive for?My dear little fellows, please believe me when I say that it was notout of kindness; that's not even one of Cedríc's faults."   "I find it quite easy to believe," said Morrie. "But you haven't gotyour prey home yet. And it doesn't seem to be going your way, whateverhappens. If we come to Guard House, it won't be Clarénce that benefits:Aruman will take all the pupils he can find if it'll help him pay therent. If you want anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal."   Clarénce began to lose his temper. The name of Aruman seemedspecially to enrage him. Time was passing and the disturbance was dyingdown. Cedríc or the Guards might return at any minute. "Have you gotit - either of you?" he snarled.   "Saddam, saddam!" said Pipsqueak.   "Untie our legs!" said Morrie.   They felt the goblin's arms trembling wildly. "Curse you, you filthylittle vermin!" he hissed. "Untie your legs? I'll untie every string inyour bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the bones? Search you!I'll cut you both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help of yourlegs to get you away  and have you all to myself!"   "Wait!" shouted Pipsqueak. "Don't you want our help in finding theRing?"   "Ring?? What on earth are you talking about, you pathetic shrimp?"Clarénce snapped.   Pipsqueak was suddenly much, much more afraid.   Suddenly he seized them. He tucked them one under each armpit andcrushed them fiercely to his sides. Then he sprang forward, stoopinglow. Quickly and silently he went, till he came to the edge of theknoll. There, choosing a gap between the watchers, he passed like anevil shadow out into the night, down the slope and away westwardtowards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that directionthere was a wide open space with only one fire.   After going a dozen yards he halted, peering and listening. Nothingcould be seen or heard. He crept slowly on. Then he stood up, as if torisk a sudden dash. At that very moment the dark form of a rider loomedup in front of him. "Nazdaq!" he shouted in surprise and alarm. It washis undoing. A polo mallet whistled through the air and dealt him asharp crack on the skull. He gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still.The hobbits remained flat on the ground, too afraid to move.   At last Morrie stirred and whispered softly: "I don't even want toknow what he was up to, but now we've got some sort of chance! But howare we to avoid being walloped?"   The answer came almost immediately. From the yells and screeches thatwere coming from the knoll they guessed that their disappearance hadbeen discovered. Then suddenly the answering cries of goblin-voicescame from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires. Mauríce hadapparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers with heavy-dutyriding crops and several cats o' nine tails. The riders were drawing intheir ring close round the knoll so as to prevent any sortie, while acompany rode off to deal with the newcomers. Suddenly Morrie andPipsqueak realised that without moving they were now outside thecircle: there was nothing between them and escape.   "Now," said Morrie, "if only we had our legs and hands free, we might get away."   "I was going to tell you: I've managed to free my hands. These loopsare only left for show." Pipsqueak tugged at the string, only to findthat he had just unwittingly made the knot fast. Morrie said a word,then pulled a stiletto from his heel ("Don't ask," he warned hisastonished cousin) and cut the bonds.   The hobbits then sat and ate two or three Twinkies, until Morrierealised how stupid that was and gestured for Pipsqueak to get a moveon.   They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, but it was a longslow business. They reached the edge if the river, then looked back.The sounds had died away. Evidently Mauríce and his lads had beenkilled or driven off. Already the night was old. In the east the skywas beginning to grow pale.   "We must get under cover," said Pipsqueak, "or we shall be seen. It won't be any comfort to us if the riders only find out we aren'tgoblins when we're dead. I could stagger on now. What about you,Morrie?"   Morrie got up. "Yes," he said. "I can manage it. Twinkies do putheart into you; it must be all the life-enhancing E-numbers andpreservatives. Damn, I have such a hangover. I need a drink."   They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of theriver. "You seem to have been doing well for yourself, Master Took,"said Morrie. "You aren't a total moron after all! Your father will bepleased."   Pipsqueak looked puzzled.   "Do you not yet understand, Paragraph Took? Your father paid me ahandsome sum to train you up to become a decent criminal mastermindlike the rest of your family. I thought he was throwing his money away,but it looks as though you may shape up yet.   "But Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now, because for all thatyou still have absolutely no idea where we are, do you? That's what youget for not getting a decent education. We are walking along the Entwash;in front of us is Fangorn Forest."   "Lead on, Moribund!" said Pipsqueak. "If you have any idea where you'regoing, which I doubt."   "I am going to Isengard, as I told you," Morrie snapped. "Now shut upif you don't want a dagger in your guts. We can take a short-cut throughthe forest. Just don't do anything stupid."   "I won't," said Pipsqueak, lighting a cigarette and throwing the litmatch away.   The two of them made their way into the forest under the huge branches.They looked back across the river, and with the dawn the riders charged,waving their mallets, and launching a rain of golf-balls.   "That's what you get if you trample on the pride and golf courses ofthe aspiring middle class," Morrie observed. "The highest echelon ofgoblin society has had it: Sam would be ecstatic." He shuddered, andturned away.   So it was that they did not see the last stand, when Cedríc wasovertaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he wasslain at last by Eowynn, who dismounted and beat him repeatedly in thehead with a sand wedge.   Then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound, the ridersmade a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies. So endedthe longest cross-country run in the history of public schooling, andno news of it came ever back either to Tower or to Guard House.   "Hey, look at this!" Morrie shouted. He pointed at a goblin thatlooked as though it had been trampled to death by a pair of very largeand very heavy feet. Next to it was a violin-case. Morrie picked it up.   "It suits you," remarked Pipsqueak, not knowing what else to say.   Morrie grinned. He stood silent for a moment, then observed, "Didn'tthose goblins seem a bit stiff, or scratchy, to you?"   "I don't know any more than you do about that," said Pipsqueakinnocently. "After all, you were the one who went to a public school."   "What are you implying?" Morrie demanded querulously.   They disappeared into the forest.     * The Bywater Smile - Shire slang for an expertly slit throat, not        to be confused with the Tuckborough grin, which under optimum       conditions required a corkscrew, an ell of twine and three enraged pigs,       or the Scary grimace, which was a particularly unnerving expression. In       the past Morrie had crafted some great smiles. These were not up to his       usual standard, but still effective.
   Along the stream the hobbits walked, west and up towards theslopes, deeper and deeper into Fungang. As their fear of the Orcsdwindled they started paying attention to their surroundings, andsuddenly, simultaneously, they discovered something truly remarkable:many of the "trees" were lamp-posts!  There they stood, scatteredamong the trees as though they be planted there as naturally as anybeech or birch!  Some of them were lit with a flicker of gas-flame ora cobweb-covered lightbulb. The hobbits were positively flummoxed.   As the initial surprise subsided, the ever practical Morrie startedlaying plans for an import business of streetlamps into the Shire. Hementioned this to Pipsqueak.   "Won't be profitable in itself, I think," replied Pipsqueak. "Toomany places where they like the dark, except for the occasionalbonfire. But as a cover for our more rewarding businesses it'd beperfect."  Morrie's regard for Pipsqueak went up considerably at thisdisplay of first-rate criminal thinking. From about 1½ to 2 on ascale from 0 to 100 ---   "Let's have a toast to that," said Morrie. "I need a drinkanyroad."  Sweet Eru I need a drink. Head still throbbing, heclambered onto a tree-root that wound into the stream and, pretendingto drink from the swirling water, had a swig, and another swig, from abottle that he had swiped from the dying body of Clárence. He did notsuspect that an equally-unsuspecting Pipsqueak did precisely the sameon another tree-root.   Returning to firm ground, a little unsteadily (Clárence had been abig drinker), they at once fell to the topic of food. "Well, wehave our Twinkies," said Morrie. They looked at their dwindlingsupplies. About fifty packages, between them. "Won't last tilltomorrow noon," commented Pipsqueak.   Just then they became aware of an orange light that had appearedfurther into the wood, north and a little west. "Lookit that," saidMorrie. "Could it be a fast food joint turning on their advertisingbillboard or something?"   They began to walk towards the orange light. A few steps into thewood Pipsqueak suddenly stopped. Then he laughed. There lay a hugesuit of armour, leaning against a tree. The tie still bound aroundits neck, mousy brown on closer inspection, proved it to have belongedto an orc. Pipsqueak put the armour on, or rather, climbed into it.Being slim and trim for a hobbit, he managed to squeeze his waist downthrough the yawning neck-hole. He laughed again, his head sticking uplike an apple showing over the rim of a barrel. Morrie smiledcondescendingly.   "What's that pin on the tie?" he asked. "Looks like a small whitehand-shaped badge or something. This belong to one of Cedríc's boys?Get out of that ironmongery, we've no time to play house now!"Pipsqueak sighed and tipped the top of the armour off with a heave anda clatter, and they went on.   After a short hike through this strange forest of metal and wood,they came to a small cliff. Up it went a flight of broad, well-laidstairs, though cracked now with age and partly covered by lichen. Atthe top of the stairs there was just a platform with a brown ironfence and a rock wall, and an especially large lamp-post. It shonewith a glaring sodium light, bright even under the morning sun. Thehobbits, broad culinary tastes though they have, felt hungrier thanever: they could not eat a lamp-post of iron and glass. Not eventhey. They started climbing the stairs for a look-around.   Standing beneath the lamp-post, and somehow not daring to touch it,they looked over the forest and the plain beyond. Three sets ofcoin-operated binoculars were there, but centuries of random vandalismhad left them smashed and useless, lying on the mossy stone flags.The pedestals, curiously, were gone. The hobbits had no coins withwhich they could have used the binocs at any rate, though for Morriethis would have presented only a small problem.   They stared for a while, but the absence of fast food joints,restaurants, supermarkets, cattle herds (Pipsqueak declared that healone could eat a cow raw, if Morrie would bring it down - which heknew that his cousin could), or any other food source soon broughttheir spirits lower than ever. "Helvites druttforpilte eplefitse,"Morrie swore in the obscure crime-patois he often fell into whenagitated. Pipsqueak squirmed at the mention of apple. "And I almostliked this forest!"   "Almost liked the Forest!  That's good!  That's uncommonly good ofyou," said a strange voice, "especially considering that uncommonlyugly mood you seem to be in. Turn round and let me see your faces. Ialmost feel like squishing you like snails in the garden, but snailsmake such a yucky mess on the floor inside afterwards. I can neverscrape them entirely off my feet, those stupid slimy tubes of jello.Turn round!"  A large hand, reminding Pipsqueak of the metal skeletonof the Terminator's hand in Terminator I, grabbed each of them by theshoulder, and they were spun 540 degrees faster than one ofPipsqueak's tops. Then two large arms lifted them, somewhat moregently. Suddenly gaping down from what seemed almost high enough forbungee-jumping did little to settle their fear. They felt a tinglingin the soles of their feet.   They found themselves looking at a most extraordinary face, if faceit was. It belonged to a tall and thin figure, easily fourteen feet,though the legs were very short and thick. The face was at least fourtimes as long as it was broad, and at first glance it consisted simplyof glass, out of which the bright orange glare seared. Beneath it wasa beard like a steel brush. Whether the creature was clad in greentights like Robin Hood or some ecological Rudolf Nureyev, or that wasjust green paint, was hard to tell.   As the hobbits squinted and looked closer, the outline of a mouthas a crack in the glass and a pair of eyes behind it became evident.The eyes regarded them with a glitter of suspicion, though not, to thehobbits' minds, with any active malice.   "Hrum, Hoom," murmured the creature, and then spat a gob of slimeoff the edge of the cliff. "Very odd!  The more haste the less speed,that is my motto. Good for you that I heard your voices before Isaw you. You look like those detestable brats from the publicschools, the Orcs. But you don't sound like them, with your accents.Eplefitse indeed!"  Morrie thanked his lucky stars for havingretained his syndicate sociolect even through his schooldays.   Pipsqueak had found himself transfixed by that glare, like a rabbitilluminated at night by an approaching car. He had bared his frontteeth. Now the light subsided, and he could think again.   "Please, sir," he said, "who are you?  And what are you?"   An amused look came into the eyes deep within the glass. "Hrum,now," the apparition cleared its throat in answer, "I am a Ment.The Ment, you might say. Guardians of the lamp-posts in this forest.Fungang is my name according to some. In Westron that becomesSteelbeard."   "Ironbeard," whispered Morrie to Pipsqueak.   "But what's a Ment?" asked Pipsqueak. "Where do you come from?You look like a walking talking lamp-post to me."  Morrie pinchedhim viciously in the side, but Pipsqueak was too used to that to evennotice.   "Yes," replied the Ment, "well, hroom, my first memory is of asinging lion that walked through this forest. Excellent baritone.Wide range, too. That answers the where, I suppose. And then acold-eyed, tall woman who fled towards the mountains. Jadis, Ibelieve her name was. Queen Berúthiel to others."  The Ment's voicebecame dark and sullen. "Not related to that Galadriel at all, nomatter what silly newspapers say!"   "A singing lion??" gaped Morrie.   "Yes, I know it sounds absolutely ridiculous," replied the tallstreetlamp solemnly, its sodium glare oscillating slowly with innerthought. "Perhaps I remember incorrectly. It is a long time ago, andI was just awakened, for the first time."  Then he cleared his throatagain.   "What about you?" he continued. "Who are you?  I have never seenthe likes of you. You look like excessively overweight midget-men.You do not seem to fit into the old lists."  The hobbits glared, butthe Ment took no notice. "But perhaps they have made new lists.Let's see.        Gabble by rote now the Gits and Rascals!        First name the four, the funny peoples:        Snobs above all, the snickering Elves;        Dwarf the dealer, deep is his wallet;        Ment the Mighty, best and blessed;        Man the mocker, master of commerce;   Hm, hm, hm,        Pig gives pork, prawns are tasty;        Fish are fishy, foxes tasty;        Giraffes are grand, goats are tasty;   Hm, hm, hm. Repetitive, those old lists ---        Cats are cuddly, cows give milk;        Rats are rodents, roaches icky;        Enormous elephant, ents are tree-like...   Hm, hoom, it was a long list altogether. But you don't fit in itanywhere."   "Good," murmured Morrie to himself. To Morrie's family, obscurityuntil the knife was poised for the plunge had been a survival traitfor generations. But Pipsqueak remained true to himself:   "Why not make a new line?  Healthy hobbits, hale hole-dwellers.Put us just above the Elves and you have it!"  Again he failed tonotice the Pinch of Morrie.   "Hm, not bad," said Steelbeard. "So you live in holes, eh?  Allriiight. We'll put you in right after the Ments, perhaps. And yournames, please?"   Morrie remained silent. Taught and re-taught by experience, hekept his fingers still, though twitching:   "Yes, yes, I'm Paragraph Took, Pipsqueak to most..."   "Pipkin to some..."   "...and my companion is Moribund Brandybuck. But people just callhim Morrie. Or just Moe. We live in the country of The Shire,Whôzat in Westron, it's in what used to be Arnor, Arthurdame to bemore precise (you know, there was this king with a round table, andhis wife, and...), west of Bree, but east of the Tower Hills..."   As he drew a deep breath to continue, Morrie asked hurriedly: "Butsurely you must be tired of holding us up like this. How about, um,inviting us home?  You have stood here some time, I guess. You mustbe, um, hungry too. Speaking of which, we are maybe a little peckishor something ourselves..."   "Well I'm starving!" exclaimed Pipsqueak. "I could eat anelephant raw, two of them if they were properly cooked ---"   The old Ment put the two hobbits on what passed for his shoulders,a sort of narrow collar of iron, and strode down the stairs. Once hereached the forest floor, he began striding westwards and up, furtherand further into the woods. At first he seemed to shake violently,and Morrie, thinking he recognised the signs, nursed some hopes ofpushing his Vala dust to Steelbeard. Then the hobbits looked down,and saw that his short legs beat a pace faster than those of a runningtoddler.   Straight through the forest he strode, passing many lamp-posts onhis way. Some of these never budged. Others lit up briefly ingreeting as he passed, while a few raised their hand and said "Howdy".As for the trees, if they were small enough and in his path, hesmashed them aside in a shower of budding leaves and scented yellowishsplinters. Morrie immediately ceased thinking of that Funganglamp-post import business.   Breakfast-time passed into brunch-time. Brunch-time passed intolunch-time. Lunch-time passed into noon-meal. Noon-meal passed intotwo-o'clock morsel, which passed into dinner-time and then desserttime, and second-dinner-time and second-dessert time. Not untilsupper-time did Steelbeard appear to slow down his pace. High uponthe foothills of Mt. Themattress, where the young Mentwash chatterednoisily in a stony bed (reminding the hobbits of yet another bodilyfunction which must be attended to), Steelbeard turned away from thestream and ascended a steep grassy slope.   Suddenly the hobbits saw a dark opening. Tall lamp-posts stoodthere, forming an aisle of lights which lit up progressively as theMent approached. The hobbits were impressed, until they saw theremote control in Steelbeard's hand. He strode into the aisle, whichstood between the upward-sloping walls of a gorge. The lamp-postsalso grew progressively taller as he walked further in.   The gorge ended abruptly in a wall with a shallow cave at thebottom. Down the face of the wall came a small stream that hadescaped from the springs of the Mentwash above. It formed a spraylike a falling bead-curtain before the mouth of the cave and filled abasin and from there flowed in a channel along the aisle, until itrejoined the Mentwash below the slope behind. Behind the waterycurtain there stood a stone table and a low bed. Fifteen feet long.Next to the bed was a box of large lightbulbs, presumably for theaisle of lamps. There was no other furniture.   "There," said Steelbeard. "I have brought you seventy thousandMent-strides, each of which is about one meter in your measurement.This," pointing at the chattering channel beneath the basin, "is myurinal. You may pass water there. Not into the collecting channelsabove the basin, or I'll rip your spines out of your bodies!"  Thehobbits, put on the floor, quickly availed themselves of the offerwith many an aah and about time.   "Where do we pass hraka?" Morrie asked.   "Um, hroom, Ments never eat."  (The hearts of the hobbits made apanicky dash into their toes.)  "We drink only. So we never, whatchacall it, pass hraka?"   Then he strode over to the table, upon which stood several stonejars. Three of these he filled from one of the channels that ran intothe basin, and sprinkled something into them. Immediately they beganto glow with a light like many blended neonlights, and go slightly"gloop gloop". The largest of these he set before himself, and thetwo smaller he gave to the hobbits. These jars were almost as tall asthe hobbits themselves, and they had to climb onto them and dip theirmouths into the water.   "Whhy, Eru allmatey, thisshis --- sgoods Farmer Maggisssecretess --- t! --- sheeeketessht mmushroomsh concocshon ooh --- Igottagottagotta have shommme more ---"   The drink was actually like pure spring-water, except for thebubbles and the lightshow. But then the hobbits felt a tingling intheir feet, and the effect rose steadily through every limb, until itreached their heads, and then Oh God!  Suddenly they felt as vigorousas they had ever done. Indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on theirheads was actually standing up, waving and curling and growing, andthen falling off. The entirely bald Steelbeard saw no problem withthis, and indeed it seemed the only adverse side-effect of theMent-brew. After some time, the psychedelic effect began to wear off.   One effect of the brew was to take permanent effect, though.Forever after the two hobbits would walk with their feet two inchesabove the ground. It was the last they would ever feel of stone orshort-mown grass beneath their feet, unless weighed down with a heavyload. Even Farmer Maggot's secret mushrooms had succeeded only incausing this effect temporarily.   "You still haven't told me what you are doing in my country," saidSteelbeard, now lying on the bed, or rather, bobbing a few inchesabove it. "There's quite a lot I should like to know, about the Orcswho were just clobbered outside my forest, about Gandalf (who owes mea tidy sum, let me tell you, but otherwise he's quite a fine guy,always has a large bottle in his hat), about that Aruman or whateverhis name is nowadays, and are Galadriel and Arwen as sensuous as theysay..."  For a moment the two hobbits remained quiet. Then Morriespoke, Pipsqueak for once having the sense to bottle up.   "We come, ash you...shorry, as you know, from Whôzat. We leftwith another hobbit and his servant..."  And so Morrie continued,until he had covered as much of the story as he felt fit to tell.This left quite some gaping holes in his tale, but Steelbeard, thoughlistening intently and putting several questions, didn't push him.   "Hm, this is a bundle of news," said Steelbeard at last. "Thoughyou have hardly told me all that you know, not by a long shot.Keeping a lot from me, I believe."  He looked at Morrie with asearching eye. Morrie stared back with practised blankness. "But nodoubt you are doing exactly as Gandalf would wish. Good lads!"Pipsqueak beamed; Morrie scowled behind his face. Sam would havebusied himself making dynamite bombs in his mind, had he been there."By paint and glass, but this is a strange business: up sprout anunknown people, though they may not sprout very tall; and theforgotten Nazdaq Riders rise up to pursue them, and Gandalf takes themout scouting, and El Rond fills them with margarita until it comes outof their ears, and Galadriel shows them her favours, both of them (isshe really such a babe as they say?), and Arwen accompanies them (isshe really such a leather-and-lash victrix as I've heard?), and Orcstry to initiate them, and Sauron and Aruman both hunt them with legalforms: indeed they seem to be caught up in the Mother of all legalhassles. I hope they weather it!"   "No legal hassles are too complicated to solve with a few BywaterGrins," replied Morrie, with a calm assurance based on experience andgenerations of family history. "But what about yourself?  What's yourrelationship with Aruman?"   "Hocch, not too good, not too good," was Steelbeard's reply. "Hebegan his career as one of the Good Guys, you know. Always a flask inthe hat. Together with Gandalf he was the best damn wizard that evercame out of Roke since Sparrowhawk, whose true name was Ged. Used tobe Archmage too. Some jolly booze-ups we had, Aruman, Gandy andmyself. But he has been tight-fisted with his spirits lately. And hehas started a school for boys down at Isengard, if you'll believe it.Well, you do, of course. His pupils are all Orcs: always up tomischief. Wandering around in the outskirts of my forest!  Full ofpranks, too. They'd cut down a tree and leave it to rot as soon aslook at it. No harm in that, of course, but they do the same to thelamp-posts!  Pull them down with ropes, carry them off to be remeltedin the forges of Isengard. That's what they need the trees for.Smashing the glass with slingshots, just for fun. Sniffing the gasfrom the gas-lamps ---   "I think I know what he is up to. He is plotting to become aCorporation, or the manager of one. He has some kind of arms-for-weedtrade with some obscure rat-country up north ---" the hobbits scowled"--- and he is using those detestable pupils as cheap labour, bloodyscabs. And he's up to worse. It is the mark of evil things that camein the Great Darkness that they cannot abide grassy lawns, especiallyduring the sunlit hours: they positively blossom with allergies, butAruman's pupils can endure them even if they hate them. I wonder whathe has done. Are they Celebrity Journalists he has ruined with hisbribes, or has he blended the races of Corporate Lawyers andLiterature Critics?  That would be, well, an amusing prank come tothink of it.   "I have to put a stop to this!  I have been idle too long!  Sod thatbastard!"  Morrie beamed.   Steelbeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, andthumped his hand on the table. It broke in two with a loud crackand a clatter of stone jars. The two vessels that the hobbits haddrunk from trembled and sent up two jets of flame, which scorched theceiling and then caused them to rocket out of the cave, much to theconsternation of the hobbits. Steelbeard took no notice.   "I will stop it!" he boomed. "You'll be welcome to hang aroundhere until I come back."  The hobbits, who knew that even the bestmushroom liquor could not make up for lack of solid food, politelyoffered to come along rather, if he would have them; Morrie thought ofpossible rich looting in the ruins of Isengard.   "Suit yourselves, midgets," shrugged Steelbeard. "But whatever youhope to accomplish is beyond me."   The next morning the hobbits woke to find a cool sun shining intothe Ment-house. Steelbeard was not to be seen, and that was ablessing: his sodium glare had kept them awake most of the night. Asthey were done washing themselves in the basin and just about to startsearching for whatever powder Steelbeard had put into those jars theday before, they heard him returning.   "Hoo boy!  Good morning, Morrie and Pipsqueak!" he said to them."You sleep long!"   "Not as long as you think," murmured Morrie with ayawn.   "I have been many hundred Ment-strides already," Steelbeardcontinued. "Now we will have a drink, and go to Mentmoot."   He poured them out two stone bowls of water, and sprinkledsomething into them. Immediately the lightshow (difficult to see now,in the morning sun) and the "gloop gloop" started; but they weredifferent colours from the evening before, and the water lesspsychedelic and more sustaining, more food-like so to say. Thehobbits were reminded of the brownies made from old "Belladonna"Took's famous recipe, which had earned her her nickname. While theydrank, Steelbeard stood impatiently tapping his toes.   "Where is Mentmoot," Pipsqueak ventured to ask.   "Hoo, hocch?  Mentmoot?  It's not a place, it's a gathering ofMents. Just wait until you see the blended light of half a hundredagitated Ments --- though it doesn't often happen nowadays. But Ihave managed to twist a fair number of arms this morning. We shallmeet in the place where we have always met: Darndingle Men call it. Iknow precisely why: they always go 'darn darn darn' and cover theireyes on those rare occurrences when they come across a Mentmootthere." He chuckled. "It is away south from here. We must be therebefore noon."   "Um, you wouldn't happen to have some sun-glasses fit for us?"asked Pipsqueak.   Steelbeard made no reply. He lifted them up onto his shoulders andat once set off. At the entrance to the court he kicked one of thespent and sooty jars aside and turned right. At once he startedhumming to himself. Or so it seemed for quite a while to the hobbits.They caught no proper words, but rather things like "Boom doom boomdoom crack boodoom rumboom boom". Then they noticed the large drumhe was carrying, beating on it with his large hands as he walked; andof course the occasional crack of a young tree being splintered out ofthe Ment's way.   During a pause in the Ment's drumming, Pipsqueak said: "I found asuit of Orc-armour just before we met you, down by the river. Itseemed to have belonged to one of Aruman's boys, you know, Cedríc'scrowd. Do you know what it was doing there?'  Steelbeard made noreply, but immediately resumed drumming. Morrie was not too deep inthought to notice this.   They had been going for a long while - Pipsqueak had tried to keepcount of the "ment-strides", but had lost count before ten - whenSteelbeard began to slacken his heron's pace. Suddenly he stopped,and raising his hands to his mouth let out a great call. Hoom hoom!The hobbits went ringing deaf for several minutes, and failed to hearthe answering calls in the distance.   At once he resumed walking, now and then sending out anotherhorn-call; the hobbits covered their ears each time. As their hearingreturned, they noticed the answering hollers, progressively louder andnearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like animpenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that thehobbits did not recognize, which didn't rule out a lot of tree-kinds:they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in darkglossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff uprightflower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.   Most of the trees in this hedge were of one size and height, butsome of them were younger and smaller. Steelbeard strode straightahead, smashing through the hedge without slackening his pace andignoring the opening not far to his left. Fortunately he had theforethought of lifting the hobbits up above his head; otherwise theywould have been horribly scratched or even impaled on theflower-spikes. Once inside the hedge the hobbits found themselves onthe lip of a bowl-shaped dingle in the land. Already a number ofMents were standing in the bottom ("Hey, Steelbeard, why cantcherleave the bloody 'edge undamaged just for once?"), and an equalnumber were striding down the slope, having come through openings inthe north, east and west.   As they drew near the hobbits gazed at the Ments. They hadexpected to see a number of creatures as much like Steelbeard as onehobbit is like another; and they were very much surprised to seenothing of the kind. The Ments were as different from each other asone lamp-post is from another (duh!): some small, quaint, with littlegas-lights in them and made of brass, some large lamps like the oneslining roads, on aluminium poles, some like bill-boards with a host ofmany-coloured little lightbulbs and cheery, well-illuminatedexhortations to eat at Durin's Last Stand (Over 140 Served), some likewooden telephone poles with lamps affixed to them, some (the tallestMents) like the floodlights illuminating sports fields. These stoodand moved like something out of Jurassic Park, and Pipsqueak giggledin a way that would have done Giggly the Dverg honour. Yet as theycame close, the hobbits saw that they were of the same kind asSteelbeard, and all had the same eyes (ie. the same kind of eyes,not sharing a single pair between them or something): not all so oldand so deep, but with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression(almost zombie-like, until one saw the awareness within those wells),and their voices were much like his.   And yes, they lit up with a light strong and bright enough almostto flash-cook the hobbits, who would have gone blind had they notcovered their eyes with their arms. Steelbeard put them down andpresented them, cowering two inches above the turf, to the otherMents, and then they took their leave as fast as they could. A fewseconds later they sat panting shoulder-deep in a little pool in thestream that ran into the dingle, removing their scorched outergarments.   "Oh Eru, not only have we gone bald as palantíri (whatever theyare; it's Gandalf's expression), but it looks like we have got aflash-tan now to make us look like, um, some of those minorities ---"   "Yes," replied Morrie. "I didn't know what the Ments could do toIsengard. I believe it is encircled by a ring of stone, like a tallcastle-wall. But those Ments look like they could melt their waythrough. I wish I could take some of them home to melt some of thoseSoB's," meaning the Sackville-Bagginses.   The hobbits went in search of berries and fruits, realizing after afew hours that fruits and berries, ripe or unripe, are not plentifulin early spring. Then Pipsqueak set some snares for rabbits instead,having saved the ropes that the Orcs had tied them with, and splittingthem lengthwise into strings fit for a rabbit's neck. Having a dozenTwinkies while they waited, they listened to the conclave in thedingle behind the hedge. Steelbeard's horn-calls and drum had madethem expect a similar music from the Ments; but instead they foundthemselves listening to violins and their larger cousins, to guitars(electric and unplugged), flutes, several percussion sets, variousbrass instruments, and at least two pianos and an organ. The music ofthe Mentmoot was rather pleasant to the ears, and happily not as loudas the Ment-light was bright.   Possibly the rabbits of Themattress thought the same, for an hourlater the hobbits had three coneys (and the traps set again), and abright fire ready to roast them. Morrie's several concealed daggerswere ample to skin and prepare them, and his regard for Pipsqueakincreased to at least 4 on that scale from 0 to 100. As they caughttwo more coneys while eating the other three, to 4½ or so. He evenbegan to feel pleased that he had failed to lose his squeaky-voicedcousin in Moira.   As they were belching after the fifth rabbit and picking theirteeth with their finger-nails, they heard the orchestra in the dinglebecoming quiet. Then they saw Steelbeard striding towards them inthat gait which never failed to amuse them; and with him came anotherMent.   "Hm, hroom, hocch, here I am again," said Steelbeard. "Are yougetting weary, or feeling impatient, hmm, eh, eh, eh, nudge, nudge,knowwhatImean?  Well, I am afraid that you must keep your spirits up awhile more. Here's some of my secret powder to help you to do that.Just a single grain of it in a cupful of water seems enough foryou."  He handed them a little plastic bag each with somemany-coloured powder in them. The hobbits beamed as if they wereMents themselves.   "Also I have brought you a companion. We have still much todiscuss, but Bregalad here says that he has already made up his mindand needs not remain at the Moot. Hm, he is the nearest thing amongus to a hasty Ment. You ought to get on together. Good-bye."Steelbeard turned and left them.   Bregalad stood a while surveying the hobbits solemnly, or so itseemed to them, until they saw his feet a few inches above the turf.He was a tall Ment, and seemed to be one of the younger ones. Hisface was a single white lamp upon an aluminium pole. He held a largecello-case in his hand.   As his feet reached the turf again, he began slowly to focus on thehobbits. Then he spoke. "Ha hmm, my frien's, less go --- go --- fora walk. Home."  He paused for a few minutes, and then, starting towalk, spoke more clearly.   "My name is Bregalad, that is Quickbeam in your language. That'sjust a nickname, of course. I have been called that ever since I saidyes to and elder Ment more than a week before he finished hisquestion. Also I drink quickly, and sober up before most of thembegin to levitate. Speaking of which, you seem to be high enoughright now."  Morrie quickly explained how they had remained a fewinches above the ground even after the concoction had otherwise wornoff. "And mighty useful too if it lasts," commented Pipsqueak, "nexttime he bolts through the forest with a posse of Sackville-Bagginsestrying to track him!"   Quickbeam's Ment-house was nearby. It consisted only of a fewlamp-posts surrounding a well in a bank. His cello-case he stored inthe vault. After depositing it, Quickbeam filled a large bottle withwater and added some dust from the bag that Pipsqueak had received,and the rest of that day they spent very pleasantly, passing thebottle between them as they walked through the landscape laughing.   For Quickbeam laughed a lot. But then again, so did the hobbits,floating serenely hand in hand with Quickbeam above the grass. Theylaughed at every gust of wind, they laughed when they saw a flower;they rolled with laughter at the sight of an early fly. The hobbitseven forgot to catch more rabbits and eat. But Quickbeam laughed themost.   And whenever he passed a tall lamp-post like himself, he raised hisarms and laughed warmly at it. And these lamp-posts invariably shoneforth, raising their right hand and saying "Howdy".   At nightfall he brought them back to his house, and they spent afew hours sitting behind the desks like tellers without any money tocount (to Morrie's disappointment), listening to the music from thenearby Darndingle, and also to Quickbeam's stories, for they hademptied the bottle and refrained from refilling it. From Quickbeamthey learnt that he belonged to Bignarc's people, and his country hadbeen ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his"hastiness", at least in the matter of Orcs.   "There were streetlamps there, tall streetlamps that took root whenI was young, on the old ground where an ancient aluminium plant stoodmillennia ago. They lit up the forest with their light, andboyscouts, and the rescue workers coming to save them, were glad oftheir light. But then the boyscouts began carrying their own torches,and the Forest Service was disbanded, leaving the boyscouts to starveand die and rot. And then Orcs came with ropes, and some came withbulldozers, and they uprooted and overturned the streetlamps, and theycarried them to Isengard, to be turned into badges and dinner-plates,pots and, well, new lamps of Aruman's fashioning. And I walked thedead pastures, and I called their beautiful names, but they answerednot, and they were gone. They were gone. They lay dead in Isengard.   O Tarasilë, Celeb-Aglar, Ivunaurië   O streetlamp tall, I heard your call, so beautiful a sound   I saw your bright and lovely light, it round around me wound   Lamp-post slender, movements tender, joy before my eyes   O Lofty Shine, a light so fine, a mind so kind and wise   Silver Glory, how your story ended in despair   O Alu-Flame of lasting fame, you are no longer here   O Tarasilë, Celeb-Aglar, Ivunaurië"   So lamenting in many tongues the fall of aluminium-wroughtlamp-posts whom he had loved, Quickbeam sang himself to sleep. Thetwo hobbits stifled a few yawns and dozed off rather quickly too.   The next day they spent in Quickbeam's house, or near it, for ithad gotten colder. Pipsqueak set a few snares, and caught a fewrabbits, though fewer than the day before. He and Morrie ate the lastof their Twinkies, and those and three coneys were far from enough tosate their hunger properly; but a pinch of Steelbeard's dust in a fewbottles of water kept their spirits up despite this. And all day themusic came from the Mentmoot, sometimes hardly audible, at other timesrising to a great and quickening chorus.   The second night passed, and still the Ments kept awake anddiscussing. Then the third day of the Moot dawned. Pipsqueak set hissnares, but rabbits were warier now, and they had to share one, and asmall one at that. It was Pipsqueak who had the snares, but Morriehad the knives and the absolute lack of scruples, and so he had thelargest share: Pipsqueak was left gnawing half a foreleg and anothergrudge.   As the day wore on, the sound from the dingle grew more and morequiet. Quickbeam listened intently, but did not respond toPipsqueak's queries. Near sunset the Moot suddenly grew absolutelyquiet. A few minutes passed in dead silence, and then suddenly came agreat ringing shout from many voices: Hoom raah, room haah, glugglug, hand over that bottle, haah hoom, soomma summaroom!  With thatmore than fifty Ments came striding up from the dingle, withoutbending a blade of the grass which grew a few inches below their bigfeet. Then the Ments struck a marching tune. Quickbeam said nothing,but hurried in to fetch his cello.   We come, we come with mighty fun: ta-runda runda runda run!   The Ments came near to Quickbeam's house, singing louder andlouder. They had all their instruments with them, and they wereplaying them. How the Ment with the organ managed to play it whilemarching cannot be described; you must just trust the narrator onthis.   We come with fiddle, horn and drum: ta-rna rûna rûna rum!   Quickbeam picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.   Before long he met the column of Ments, two abreast, Steelbeard attheir head, laughing and vigorously beating his drum. Quickbeamquickly swung into the line beside Steelbeard, pushing the Mentalready there aside. He put the hobbits onto Steelbeard's shouldersand started playing his cello, smaller to his hands than a violin to ahuman.   "Hoom, hom!  Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!"called Steelbeard, nearly rupturing the eardrums of the hobbitsperched next to his mouth. "Come with the Moot!  Are we gonna kicksome serious ass!  Off to Isengard!"   "To Isengard!" the Ments slurred in many voices.   "To Isengard!   To Isengard!  The Iron-hard is ringed and barred by wizard's might   We do not care: let him beware: he'll get his share: we'll take our right   The man who marred, be he on guard: he will be tarred and feathered down   When we come there we'll get in gear: he will feel fear and look a clown!   We Ments are best: our final jest shall be a fest of splintered wall   With voice of doom and rolling boom, and hocch and hoom and Jericho-call!   So they sang, increasingly steadily as the concoction wore off ontheir march southwards. The hobbits stuffed their ears withpocket-lint and used Twinkie-wrappers thoughtfully saved for thepurpose.   The Ments, even when they ceased hovering and walked directly onthe ground, marched with great speed. From the dingle they descendedinto a deep fold of the land, breaking aside any of the few trees thatmight be standing in the way. Now they walked in silence, except forthe occasional crack of living wood, spilling the rising sap of earlyspring in fragrant showers. As they ascended the long slope,Pipsqueak looked back. In the failing daylight he at first thoughtthat he must be seeing things, but the many points of light could notlong be mistaken: the fifty-odd Ments from the Moot had grown tothousands of lamp-posts striding, each of them shining with one ormore bright points of light. There were many colours, thoughpredominantly white or whitish yellow. They looked like a marchingcity at night. Aruman must surely see that as soon as they reachedthe top of the incline, unless they put out their lights!   Then the hobbits sighed with relief. Just as they were about topour over the top of the last ridge before Nan Curunír, the Ments andthe lamp-posts, one by one as they came within direct sight of thegreat stone ring and the tower within it, turned off their lights.Now they stood in the early darkness of night on the high slopes abovethe Wizard's Vale.   "Night lies over Isengard," said Steelbeard, and passed round abottle that went "gloop gloop".
       "Damn, it's cold!" chortled Giggly, doing a very odd version of the Macarena.Day had finally come.... well, sort of... they thought it was day... it was socloudy that they couldn't see five feet in front of them (except for Lego-lass,who could see perfectly in lowlight and detect secret passageways, to boot).But they had slept a good four hours and were ready to start looking forhobbit-prints again.       "And don't forget that old man!" said Giggly. "I should be happier if he lefta few prints behind."       "Why would that make you happy?" said Legolas.       "Ummmm..... I dunno."       "It doesn't really matter anyway. Aragon only LOOKs like he knows what he'sdoing. AND it was an evil wraith-like-thingy that looks like Aruman and doesn'tLEAVE footprints. Saruman is at LEAST high-experience technocracy mage. Maybe athaumaturgist, actually, but I'm not so sure."       "A thauma-whatza?"       Aragon spoke from the ground, where he indeed looked like he knew what he wasdoing. "Thaumaturgists. Freaky undead who make your blood boil. Ex-wizards.Love to study."       "Make your blood boil? Well, I should say!"       Lego-lass got them back on track. "So... any IDEAS, Aragon? About the horses,I mean, not the Thaumaturgists. Where did they GO?"       "Wherever they went they sure sounded happy. But I can't read the riddlewithout a Wits + Animal Ken die pool of at least 7, re-roll 10s or not."Lego-lass gave a small hmph. "So we look first and guess later! How bout wesearch the bodies? You and Giggly go over there--" here he motioned to a placefar off to the east "--and look for clues. I'll continue over here." One lastglare from Lego-lass and the two were off. Aragon smirked to himself. He thenturned to the woods behind him. "It's all right. You can come out now, MyMorningstar!"       For some time, the companions---- [******* all questionable moments have beencensored for lack of plot vitality and occasional sadomasochism which may beunpleasant for some readers. These deletions will be noted by a small sequenceof stars; *********, often combined with an interjection of asort ******] ----Suddenly, she saw Lego-lass and Giggly running toward them,warned Aragon, and rushed back into the woods, but not before pointing towardsa more functional element to the plot: the next clue.       "This is odd... twinkie wrappers in a place like this...."       Lego-lass put in her two cents. "Well, OBVIOUSLY it was one of the hobbits.NOBODY else would have TWINKIE wrappers."       Giggly did the usual thing. "Heehee."       Lego-lass continued. "And you've MISSED something. There's that freaky-lookingOLD guy again."       "How can you tell? It's about as foggy as....."       "I got FIVE successes."       "Stupid elf-dice."       Lego-lass smirked and pointed. Giggly followed her finger and exclaimed, nearlaughter, "I see him! He looks like Santa Claus after a bonfire!"       Indeed, emerging from the mists was one of the fattest creatures ever known tobe humanoid. He was as wide as an average desktop, and clad head to toe in verydirty grey rags. He was also wearing a funny blue hat that seemed to be alittle bit small for him.       Lego-lass drew her bow, and pointed. "Die, thaumaturgist, DIE!" She lookedlike she was about to actually DO it, she pulled back and let the bow hang tothe ground. "What's wrong???...." She began to get a slightly homicidal look inher eyes. "....why can't I....." And then suddenly she lashed about with herknife, nearly stabbing Aragon where it might have hurt, shrieking "WHAT'S WRONGWITH ME?!?!?!?"       "Calm down, Mistress Elf," stated the fat guy. "I am no thaumaturgist, and Iwish to speak with you and your nearly impaled comrades." With that he jumpedway too lightly for his size onto a nearby rock, revealing a glimpse of whitecloth for about a nanosecond, and leaving the comrades bewildered. "Besides,you couldn't kill me if you tried."       "You speak as one that knows..... (get off me, you stupid elf) .....theprofession well.... (stupid!)....." Aragon attempted to say while Lego-lass wasat his throat. "Is that...." here he picked up the renegade elf and threw herinto Giggly, who lived up to his name and chuckled, "...so?"       "Not well," said the fat old man, "that would be the study of many lives.Caine leaves a long legacy. But I kill now and again. Why, I was just recentlyin a glorious battle, with this really screwed-up slimy guy in Khazad-Mum, andhe almost beat me! But I gave him one good...."       Lego-lass stopped her assault, got off of Giggly (but not without a quickwink), and whispered in awe, "Mii-miii.. ...Mesprendeur?"       "No shit, Sherlock."       With that minor vulgarity he disrobed (cringe!!! cringe!!!), and jumped offthe rock, clad now in robes of white that only made him look even more obese.The little blue hat gave place to a little white yamaka (some spell ityarmakule, in the old elvish), and the great sword Gimidhat was sheathed at hisside.       At last Aragon stirred. "Gandalf! What the hell happened to you? You'reall---"       "White? Yeah, sure. It's an honor thing. Guess what? Aruman's beenexcommunicated! I have the honors both of telling him and replacing him. Howabout that?"       "Yes, sir, but the---"       "Yeah, I miss the grey one too. But that dratted Balrog went and burned it!Luckily I was able to save my hat..."       "Tell us about the Balrog!" called Giggly.       "Well, we fought. it was fun. I whacked at him several dozen times withGimidhat, he got all slimy and whipped me. Then we took it outside, and Ifinally beat him. After I diablorized the schmuck---"       Lego-lass gasped. "You did WHAT?!"       "Diablorized him. Took his soul. Quite a rush, really." He smirked knowingly.       Aragon tried to ask, "Is that what made you so---"       "Powerful? Yes, but not the whole thing. Dha-Manwë helped out quite a bit,when I got to talk to him."       It was Giggly's turn to gasp. "You mean, you got to meet Dha-Manwë and comeback to tell us about it?"       "Yes. Gwaihir the Windlord picked me up after the diablorization of the Balrog(oh, and by the way, he was very impressed that I could still---[****** bestiality, yaoi, and vulgarity; a triple threat!*******] ---afterall these years!" The Elf, Man, and Dwerrat stood blinking while Gandalf continued."So he takes me to see Dha-Manwë, and I get powered up and sent back to helpyou people. Plus I get the new white garb. By the by," he turned and modeled itfor the others, "does this robe make me look fat?"       There was an extended sequence of blinking on the parts of Lego-lass andGiggly. Aragon tried to speak up. "Well, I was beginning to wonder what wasmaking you so---"       "Luminescent?"       "Ummm, no....more like---"       "Patronizing? Commanding?"       Aragon gave an exasperated sigh and a sweatdrop, and collapsed to the groundin frustration. With his head to his knees, he whined, "What of the Hobbits?"       "Two go by the river, two go by the lampposts. You know which are which, andthey're all alive, so far."       "And they're safe?"       "More or less. Right now it's giving you these messages that I'm concernedabout, and packing you off to Edoras."       A small thud was heard in the trees nearby, and a clump of black leather wasseen on the floor. Gandalf sauntered over to it and gave it a quick slap acrossthe less-covered end.       A disheveled Arwen arose with a sheepish look on her face. "Ummm....hi,guys!....errr..."       Gandalf got the famous insanely patronizing look upon his face. "Do you knowwhat I do to eavesdroppers, Princess?"       "If it's as famous as what you do to eagles, I'm looking forward to it."       Dark glare from Aragon. A VERY dark glare, indeed.       "No, actually, although that might become an option...."       Even darker glare from Aragon, accompanied by a hand on the hilt of a famousreforged sword. "You wouldn't dare."       "Get that hand off your sword, son of Arathon, or I will personally see thatthe one I'm here to fight for is cut off. And that will be of muchdisappointment to Morningstar here, won't it?"       Aragon growled slightly, but moved his hand.       "Much better. Now where was I? oh yes, what I do to eavesdroppers. YOU,princess, will be traveling with us..."       Arwen breathed a small rapturous "Yes!".       "...but will not be permitted to engage in any combat or physical action. Thatincludes sex."       Aragon and Arwen's jaws dropped a good 3 feet. Lego-lass and Giggly snickered.Gandalf smiled.       "Consider the fun you had this morning to be the last you will get for therest of the voyage." More snickering from Lego-lass. "You also will not beallowed to fight, or I will personally blow you to the Lonely Isle, or worse,[****** just......disgusting ******], and spoil your children to hell. Andif you, Mr. Heir of Elendil, try to stop me, you can kiss the quest, the crown,and your family jewels good-bye!"       Giggly was starting to roll on the floor.       Aragon muttered under his breath, "At least I can see mine, fatty." Gandalfdidn't hear. Instead, he continued with his speech.       "I was given messages to you three from Galadriel. Aragon first;               Where now are those ghuls of yours, El Lesser, El Lesser?               Why do thy valderie-bound wander afar?               Near are the days of a black, sunless sky,               As a moon shines with blood and we're all gonna die.               But much darker still is the road you must take;               Thank god that your lineage isn't all fake!Now I was HOPING to bear better news, but I guess that it's not gonna happen,so I go to Lego-lass now;               Lego-lass Greenbutt, longest in limb;               You're out of your mind if you think about him!               The Dwerrow is mine, and if you even try               I will hunt your ass down 'til you're ready to die!I thought that one was particularly interesting...."       Lego-lass was turning redder than the eye of Sauron. Whether it was with rageor embarrassment, nobody could tell. But Giggly was laughing as if there wereNitrous oxide being spoon fed to her personally by a half-orc in a tutu. Arwenand Aragon, meanwhile, were wondering whether of not their beloved Grandma hadreally written that...       Gandalf continued. "There was also one for you, Laughing Boy, but I don't planto say it publicly...." he went over to a much more sobered Giggly andwhispered in his ear for a good 15 minutes, as Lego-lass whetted her knife andAragon and Arwen undressed each other with their eyes. When the whispering wasdone, Giggly was at least twice as red as Lego-lass had been, and yellingthrough his laughter, "How the [insert potent dwarven swear word here] did youremember all that?!"       "It's an old routine."       "[potent dwarven swear word]!!!!"       "Well, a phrase like [****** odd. Very very odd. ******] isn't exactlyhard to forget, especially after it's been done so many times." Silence from all butGiggly.        Arwen's jaw dropped. "Grandma is one sick cookie."       "....Right." Gandalf whistled and then spoke to the others. "Well, it's timeto go."       Giggly chortled. "But.... I can't exactly... walk.....!"       The results of the whistle were observed as the footsteps of horses were heardnearby.       "There is more than one horse coming."       "You lost two, I brought one, and a third is tagging along for our littlerenegado."       The horses ran up to Gandalf, with the exception of one of the new ones, whojust lolled in the grass. That one seemed to be Gandalf's, because the instanthe lay down, the fat Wizard was shouting at it.        "Come on, Slimshadë, please stand up! Please stand up! Stupid damn horse!Slimshadë, please! Stand up!!! You can be such a good horse, when you put yourmind to it! Come ON, Slimshadë!!!"       Aragon piped in. "Ummm, where did he take our horses?"              "Just to get a wider view of the area."       "Right.... wider....."       "What was that, young man?"       "I said right, wider.... er, I mean White Rider... no... nevermind. What isthat sound in the distance?" He pointed toward Medusald, the hall of the gildedsnake, far to the north, and there was a faint trace of smoke as well.       "Battle and war! Ride on, Slimshadë!" And with that he jumped upon the horse(thankfully not squishing it) and rode into the distance, the others not farbehind.
    They rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gatheringnight, the monotony relieved only by Giggly asking "Are wethere yet?" every five minutes.  Gandalf allowed them only afew hours rest after Lego-lass fell out of her saddle and wasalmost trampled to death.  The waxing moon sank into thecloudy west, an important point to remember should you wishto draw up a table of moon positions to prove how wrong thetiming of the whole story is.    Suddenly The Horse Formerly Known As Slimshadë, beingfar more intelligent than normal horses (and probably farmore intelligent than anyone else in the book), stopped andneighed.  As the other horses caught up (he was the fastestas well) Lego-lass, Aragon, Giggly and Arwen got their firstglimpse of The Golden Hall.    The source of the smoke and metallic noise was alsorevealed.  In front of the hill on which the Hall stood,hundreds of Dunlending slaves were labourious turning thespits to roast thousands of chickens of an enourmousbarbecue.  A large sign above proclaimed 'Made by theMetalwork Dept. of Isengard School for Boys'.    "Lo!  It is the Great Hall of Medusald," cried Gandalf,pointing, "called The Golden Hall because of the largenumbers of golden dandelions which you can see growing onthe side of the hill and out of the guttering."    "Dandelions!?!" exclamied Giggly. "Am I to believe thatthere is no actual gold involved anywhere?"    "No."    "None?"    "None."    Giggly fell silent.    "Speak, Lego-lass, and tell us what you see," commandedGandalf.    "The same as the rest of you," Lego-lass responded overthe sound of Giggly's sobs. "What did you expect? Its only 50metres away."    "In that great building," Gandalf said, pointing at theHall, whose peeling paint and missing roofing tiles gave ita less than grand look, "HeyHoDen, king of the Rohirrim, holdshis court."    The travellers rode up to the Hall.  On either side theypassed ancient graves.  "Those on the left are the tombs ofthe kings, those on the right the tombs of the royal pets."    "I used to know a chant that would have been appropriatenow," said Aragon as they passed the tomb of Fuzzy, theRoyal Hamster, "but I've forgotten it."    "For that you should all be truly thankful," muttered Arwenunder her breath.    Surprisingly no one came to meet them until they reachedthe great (or shabby, depending on your point of view) doorsof the hall and dismounted, at which point an obese guardwobbled up to great them.    "Bonjour!" cried Gandalf in greeting.    The guard looked blank.  After a few seconds he let outthat great slogan of slobbish incomprehension: "Yer wha?"    "Bonjour, mon ami!" Gandalf persisted.    The guard turned to Aragon.  "Is this bloke mad or summin?"he asked.    Gandalf looked disappointed.  "Don't you speak the noblelanguage of the Rohirrim?"    "Don't be stupid, mate.  We gave up on that years ago.  Whowants a language where the verbs have so many forms no-onecan understand them, and the words are masculing andfemining?"    "Masculine and feminine," corrected Gandalf.    "Yeah, whatever.  Hang on a minute, I'm sure there'ssomething I should have said before." He rummaged in hispockets and pulled out a piece of paper.  "Here we go - 'Whogoes there?'" he read, sounding important, or as importantas a fat man in rusty chain mail can.    "Tell us who you are first," demanded Arwen irritably.    "Okay, babe."  Aragon winced on his behalf  "I'm Hammy, theDoorstop of HeyHoDen.  Now you."    Gandalf answered.  Aragon had been noticing with greatirritation how the wizard had assumed the role of leader."We are travelers from afar.  I am Gandalf the mightywizard, and these are Lego-lass and Arwen, the beautifulelves -" Lego-lass blushed, "-and this is Giggly, the craftyDwerrow; and this is Aragon, some bloke who comes with us."Aragon glared at Gandalf's large back, but remained silent.Bide your time, he thought to himself, wait until he's asleepone night, and then...    "Oh, I'd better let you in then.  First you must lay downyour weapons."    "I will not lay down my sword," growled Aragon, "for it isthe sword of Elendil reforged, that was broken under..."    "Look, I just want the weapon, not its life story," saidHammy, souding bored.    "Just give it to him," whispered Gandalf.  "We haven't gotall day to argue with idiots."    Reluctently, Aragon laid down his sword.  With it wentGiggly's axe and Lego-lass's bow.  "I must request that youleave your staff here, master Gandalf," said the guard.    "Idiot," Gandalf said, this time out loud.  "Would you denyan old man his stick?"    "The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a propfor age.  You could take somebody's eye out with that thing."    As Gandalf laid it agaist the wall, Aragon pulled faces athim and chanted "Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah".    Arwen laid down her broadsword.  "I must ask for the knivesas well, babe." said Hammy.  Arwen growled and laid themdown.  "And the crossbow, and the morningstar, and theaxe..."    Gandalf, Aragon, Giggly and Lego-lass entered the hall,leaving behind Arwen and her innumerable weapons.  In thecentre of the enourmous hall there was a small square ofcarpet, covered in empty crisp packets, chicken bones andlager cans.  On this sat a small armchair, a large sofa, acoffee table and a strangely empty space.    "Greetings, HeyHoDen, King of Rohan," called Gandalf toanother fat man, this one, like Hammy, shabbily dressed, butwearing a tarnished crown and sitting in the armchair.  On thesofa sat Eowynn (who winked at Aragon) and a short, skinnyman with greasy hair.    "I return your greetings on behalf of the king," said theshort man.  "I am the chief of his counsellors, Grimey."    "So you are the one who some call Wormtongue."    "I am."  Lego-lass noticed the way in which his tongueflickered in and out of his mouth as he talked.  "Pray tellme what business you have with us, master Gandalf, who somecall Stormcrow!"    "Why do they call me Stormcrow?" said Gandalf, temporarilydistracted.    "For they say that wherever you go, bad news and troublefollows."    "So why Stormcrow?"    "I don't know! I didn't invent the nickname!"    "That is because you, Wormtongue, are too stupid to inventanything."    "Do not be so sure, master wizard.  It was I who inventedthe Great Barbecue, which was made by Aruman as a gift tous, and which feeds our people."    Aragon felt that he ought to have some part in thecoversation. "Why can't the king speak for himself?"    Both Gandalf and Grimey glared at him.  "Because," saidGrimey, "he is busy awating the invention of the television."He indictaed the bare patch of carpet.    "But surely he can speak for himself," said Aragon. "Andwhere is Eonard?"    The king spoke at last, in a deep, weary voice. "He hasbeen grounded, and sent to his room without any supper, forsuggesting that we go to war with our good friend Aruman."    "Friend?!? ARUMAN?!?  What false notions have you putinto your good lord's head about that most villainous ofheadmasters?"    "See, lord, how the wizard comes here to corrupt us? Isay..."  At that moment, Grimey stopped speaking.  Gandalfhad produced a short black stick, white at the ends, fromunder his cloak and was pointing it at Grimey.  He mutteredsomething under his breath, and there was a flash of light.    If Gandalf had had his staff, no doubt the light would havebeen enough to illuminate the hall.  With his wand, however,the flash was as bright as a torch when the batteries arelow.    "Ow!" cried Grimey, clutching at his foot.  He lost hisbalance, tripped over an old can of bitters, and fell,hitting his head on a chair leg and knocking himself outcold.  Giggly curled over with laughter, and Eowynn andLego-lass applauded and cheered.    "Now I may speak to you, Lord HeyHoDen, without theinterference of your slimy little servant.  You must takeheart, for what he has told you is not always the truth.Rise from that chair, and come and look upon your kingdom!"    HeyHoDen stood up, slowly and with great difficulty, thechair groaning as the springs expanded once again."Eonard!" he cried, "come here at once!"    A door opened at the back of the hall and a tall, lankyman emerged, looking sheepishly around.    "Go and fetch my sword from Grimey's chamber.  I am goingoutside!"    "Why do I always have to get the swords?"  Eonard moaned."Can't Eowynn do it?"    "Fetch me my sword, boy!"    "But dad..."    "DO IT!"    "Yes dad... mutter... mumble... mutter..."    "Too long have I listened to the lies of Wormtongue, as Isat in my chair waiting for his television nonsense that hesaid Aruman was working on.  I will look out on my land, andbreathe the free air again."    "I was just going to sugest that," said Gandalf irritably.He strode up to the doors.  "Open. The Lord of the Markcomes forth!"    "Who's Mark?" Lego-lass whispered to Aragon, who shrugged.    The door were slowly pulled open, to reveal a pile, now 7foot high, of Arwen's weapons, with the warrior herself saton top.    "Look out over your land, HeyHoDen.  All is not dark."cried Gandalf.  "Evil broods in the east, but the greatestthreat come from Aruman.  He plans to invade Rohan, fighthis way to Edoras and turn the great hall into a dormitoryfor a new public school."    "Here's your stupid sword, dad," muttered Eonard, joiningthem. "Hairygrim, or whatever you call it."    HeyHoDen ignored him.  "Then we, the people of Rohan, mustcast off the slobishness in which we have lived, and go towar to defend the non-selective comprehensive educationsystem of our fore-fathers!  Fetch me that fool Hammy.  Wemust muster an army and head with all haste to Deem's Help,the great fortress of our people!"  But Hammy appeared tohave vanished.  On closer investigation, it appeared thatevery other soldier in the city had vanished, taking theirhorses with them.  Later, a note was found with Gone toDunharrow.  Back after war has ended scribbled on it.Rohan would go to fight without an army.    The preparations that went on during the day were bothtiring and tiresome.  The team of Dunlending slavesdisassembled the barbecue to carry it with them.  After muchdeliberation, and several particularly cruel ideas fromEonard, who had been grounded many times as a result ofarguing with HeyHoDen, it had been decided that the best thingto do was to lock Grimey in Edoras.  Several hours were wastedwhile Arwen, angry at having missed yet another vital scene,re-secreted her weapons about her personage.  A summoning toarms was sent out, and when that failed Eonard was sent outwith a sharp stick (he wasn't trusted with a sword) to roundup civilains.    So the company that set off to defend Rohan was not anarmy.  It was a rabble.  Due to the sudden dearth of horses,Eowynn had to share horses with Arwen (who was busy thinkingof ways to join the battle without Gandalf noticing), Eonardwith Aragon and HeyHoDen with Gandalf. (The Horse FormerlyKnown As Slimshadë was a strong horse, Aragon mused asthey rode.  Those two men must weigh 70 stone between them.)In front of them they drove hordes of farmers, armed withpitchforks, and smiths, armed with pokers, like pigs to theslaughter.  They had to turn back once, when it was realisedthat Eowynn had forgotten her make-up bag.  But once fourDunlendings had been assigned to carry the enormous bag, theyrode unhindered.    They rode to war.
   Forth they rode from the gates of Medusald.  In the red lightof the setting sun the fields of dandelions appeared to be ablaze.As they rode past the silent graves, Giggly read the inscriptionsaloud.   "'Thengel, and his cat Tiger'."   "'Fengel, and his dog Rex'."   "'Folcwine, with his fish Goldie'."   "'Folca, with his dog Prince'."   "'Walda, and his lizard Bert'."   "'Fluffy, and his dog Brylca'."   "Um, I think you got that one backwards," corrected Lego-lass.   "No, that's what it said," insisted Giggly.  "Let's ask one ofthe locals.  Hey, Eonard!  What can you tell us about King Fluffy?"   "Those were dark days for Rohan," replied Eonard, "of which wedo not speak."   They rode on in silence, into the deepening night.   Slowly, though, a light grew in the west, as if the sun haddecided to make a U-turn after sunset.  Gandalf called Lego-lassforward. "Can you make out the source of that light?" he asked."It's coming from up towards Isengard.  I fear that Aruman isbrewing some new trouble for us."   Lego-lass peered towards the glow on the horizon.  "I don't understand what it is that I'm seeing," she reported, "I can seethe tower of Orthanc silouetted against hundreds of brightlights.  The glare is too great to make out any details, though."   "I must be off!" exclaimed Gandalf.  "HeyHoDen, you'll have toget down and ride with Eonard and Aragon."  At this Eonard andAragon's horse let out a grunt of dismay, but somehow HeyHoDen wasable to scramble onto his back.   As Gandalf rode off in haste, one of the farmers asked thesmith marching beside him what was up.   "'Tis none of our business," said the smith.  "The affairs ofour betters are too high for such as we."     "Humph," snorted the farmer, "I say he's running off as soonas the danger starts, leaving our butts out here on the line.Darn wizards.  They're going to be the first ones against thewall when the revolution comes.  Them and suck-up smiths, thatis."   The horses were getting worn out with two or three riders each, so Aragon and Lego-lass went now with Eonard in the van.  As theinternal combustion engine was not to be invented for another fewmillenia, though, the van had to be pushed by six of the peasants,including one very irate farmer.  "Darn princes and elves are goingto be up against the wall pretty soon after the wizards and smiths."   They decided to turn aside from the Isengard road to take refugein the fortress of Deem's Help, because they felt that this would alsobe a good place to make their stand.  It didn't hurt that Erkenbrand,the commander of the Hornburg, was known to stock the best winecellar north of Gondor.  Deem's Help was a narrow canyon cut backinto the mountains.  A wall stretched across the mouth of the canyon,at one end of which stood the fortress known as the Hornburg.  It wasnamed after the great jazz bands of old. In the days when Deem himselflived in the fortress, they would have open-air concerts in the canyon,and the surrounding hills acted as a natural ampitheater.  Even todaya trumpet blast from the walls of the Hornburg would make the hillsring with the sound of music. Julie Andrews herself could do nobetter.   "Who goes there?" came the challenge from above the gate intothe Help.  "Does the Golden Hall send any aid in our time of need?Oh, it's just you, Eonard.  Can't be helped I suppose.  Who's thatyou brought with you, then?"   "Do you not recognize your lord and master?  Come forth andkneel before King HeyHoDen!"  came the response from Eonard.   "My liege!" grovelled the guard.  "We had feared that . . ."   "That I was hidden in Meduseld, beguiled by the lies of atraitor?" finished HeyHoDen.   "Well, not that exactly.  Mainly we just thought you were too lazyto get off your fat butt and ride all the way out here.  The wordin the outer provinces is that you've turned into a total couchpotato."  Then, turning back to the guard tower, he cried out "Openthe gates!  Your King is here!"   Glad cries of "Hey! Ho!" arose from the walls.  The king of theMark rode through the open gates, flanked by his sister-son andsister-daughter, not to mention his brother-neighbor-cousin-dog--groomer-lover-aunt-husband-nephew-friend, and several otherrelations of even greater removal.  Aragon, Giggly, Lego-lass and Arwen were left milling around with various smiths and farmersoutside the walls.   "This is more like it," chuckled Giggly, looking around at thecliffs. "No more forests and plains for me.  This country has goodbones.  The sinews are only so-so, but the bones are really good."   "How do you feel about the cartilige?" asked Lego-lass.   "Not as good as the bones, but definitely first rate."   "Stop your dawdling," ordered Aragon, "we have to prepare.  Evennow the forces of Aruman approach."   They could see an ominous glow coming up the valley, sillouettingthe orc-forms coming before it.  Luckily they were able to set up thebarbecue and have dinner before the hoard of orcs approached the gates.  Before they were done clearing the dishes, though, the enemyranks filled the valley.  The shouts of the prefects rose above the general confusion.   "50 house points for the first one through the gates!"   "Move that battering ram into place!"   "Fight for the honor of house and school!"   "No more non-selective comprehensive education!"   "Kill the commoners!"   "Halt!"  shouted Aragon from the wall.  A strange silence settledover the orc horde as they stopped to listen to his words.  "They saythe Hornburg has never fallen when a rabble of farmers and smiths hasstood to defend it.  Turn back now and you will be allowed to live."   He was answered with derisive laughter.  "We are the Uruk-HaiPrefects! We fear no man, be he farmer or smith!"  Aragon jumped backas a rain of arrows flew toward his position, and the battle was begun.The defenders of the Hornburg and of the wall across the Help weresorely pressed.  Lego-lass and Giggly found themselves beset by foeswho had gained the top of the wall.   "How do you fare?" grunted Giggly as he ducked under a swingingsword.   "Not so bad.  There's six!" Lego-lass counted as she pulled herdagger from the corpse of a falling orc.   "I've killed eight,"  returned Giggly, bringing his battle-axe downon another foe.  "Make that nine."   Suddenly there was a lull, as the top of the wall was free of orcsfor the moment.  "I say," mused Lego-lass, pulling out her bow andfiring off a couple of arrows at the army below, "have you ever really thought about it?  There's eight, by the way."   "Thought about what?" asked Giggly.   "Well, doesn't it seem a bit, well (nine), wrong, to you?  We just assume (ten) that all orcs are our foes (eleven) because of theirancestry?"   "Here they come again!" shouted Giggly as a group of orcs cameup a ladder.  He ran to the point where they overtopped the wall,axe swinging.  "Now that you put it that way, (ten) it does seema little odd (eleven).  One would have hoped that by the end of theThird Age we'd be beyond such race-based thinking (twelve and thirteen)."  As the headless body fell at his feet he turned back to Lego-lass.   "Exactly (twelve)!" came back Lego-lass, firing arrows as fast asshe could put notch to bowstring.  "There's thirteen, we're tied!  Anyway, look at us (fourteen, I'm winning!).  As elf-maid and dwerrow,we should hate each other, but our budding relationship provesthe opposite."   "You've given me much to think on, fair Lego-lass.  Perhaps thisanti-orc prejudice of ours is unwarranted, and we should seek toreform rather than kill them.  By the way, as you were speaking I gotsix more.  My count is up to nineteen.  Hey Arwen!" he shouted to theleather-clad elf who was approaching, "My count is nineteen, and Lego-lass is at fourteen. ["It's sixteen now, dear"]  How does the battlefare for you?"   "I've killed three-hundred and seventy-two.  I'd like to see themleave THAT out of the movie," replied Arwen.     The fighting ran on late into the night.  Epic songs have been sungof the brave deeds of farmer and smith in defense of their king andcountry.  In the morning light the rabble of Rohan prepared for onelast push.  Even HeyHoDen put on his armor and stood in the firstcompany with Aragon, Lego-lass, and Arwen.  Eonard was skulking around, complaining to anyone who would listen about Aragon gettingtop billing.  Eowyn was sent to her room, told that women weren't allowedto fight.  "What about Arwen and Lego-lass?" she whined.  "They're elves,it's different," came the reply.  Giggly had disappeared during the night.  It was rumored that he'd retreated to the caves with a bandof smiths.  HeyHoDen addressed the troops.   "Today, men, is a good day to die . . . "   "Bummer of a pep-talk, pops!" came a voice from the back of the crowd.   "Quiet!  As I was saying, today is a good day to die.  That's why Iwant my sister-son Eonard to lead the first charge.  The rest of us willfollow anon. We fight, my friends, for our way of life.  We fight for theright of all men to send their children to good schools, that they maylearn to read the tales of our battle today.  The enemy wants toreserve that right for only the upper classes who can afford theirfancy schools  . . . "   "Hey, didn't you send your son to . . . " interrupted the voice fromthe back of the crowd.   "Someone shut that guy up!" HeyHoDen cut him off.  "This is yourdestiny, men.  We ride forth into glory!  We ride forth into history!Hey!  Ho!"   The battle cry of Rohan was taken up by the crowd.  Shouts of "Hey!"and "Ho!" rang out as the gates of the Hornburg were thrown open with ablast of trumpets and they surged out to meet . . . nothing.  Where theorc armies had been encamped there was a strange forest of poles ofdiffering shapes and heights (now darkened).  Not an orc was to be seen.Just then Gandalf rode up on Slimshade.   "Where've you been?" asked Aragon.   "Oh, you know, out and about, looking for the army.  They assured methey'd be along sometime later today.  They have to all get their uniformsback from the cleaners and should be along after having a nice brunch andmaybe playing a round of golf.  How'd it go here, then?"   "Damned wizards and soldiers," muttered a certain farmer in the backof the crowd, "always gone in the midst of trouble.  They'll be up againstthe wall when the revolution comes, to be sure."   The revolution would not come today, though.  Today the King of Rohanrode triumphant from the field of battle.
   So it was that the two grossly obese men, Gandalf and HeyHoDen,met again.  The hicks of Rohan stared in wonder at the poles that nowdotted the field before the Hornburg, but their attention was broken byGiggly, who strode out of the canyon behind the Hornburg, gigglingfuriously.  He was accompanied by the smiths and Gambler the Old.   "Forty-two, Miss Lego-lass!" he shouted triumpantly, as he walked toher side.   "Hmm," she mused, "I only managed to finish off forty-one."   "Damn that Arwen,"  Giggly said.  "She's got us both beat."   "Yes," replied Lego-lass.  "We're going to have to get her writtenout of the movie, or she'll end up overshadowing us both.  I'm supposedto be the token elf-babe after all, not her!" she finished with a stampof her foot.   Meanwhile, everyone turned back to the poles.  They squinted atthem, as if they were an illusion or something, but the polesremained.  Then they started to look at Gandalf suspiciously.   "Don't look at me like that," Gandalf said.  "I had nothing to dowith the poles.  It's better than what I had planned anyway, so stopcomplaining."   "Then is this the work of Aruman?"  HeyHoDen asked.  "Did he putthese poles here to trap us so his orcs can get free run of my kingdom?"   "Nope," said Gandalf.  "It's a power far older than Aruman himself:            The forest has its lamps so bright,            What could make that shining light?"   "What's that supposed to mean?" grumbled HeyHoDen.   "If you want to find out," said Gandalf, "then you'll have to comewith me to Isengard."   However, the men of Rohan decided right there to have a celebrationbarbecue, delaying their departure for the rest of the day.  Gandalffumed for a while and chain-smoked several pouches of pipe-weed, butthen he took Aragon aside so they could discuss their plans.  Theytalked in Auld High Elvish, so that no one else would be able tounderstand what they were saying (well, except for Arwen, but shealready knew the plan anyway.)   "Once we deal with Aruman, our plan for world domination will beunstoppable," said Gandalf.  "The elves are tired of Middle-earth, andwill let you do whatever you want.  The dwerrows should be fairly easyto exploit once you take over.  Old Denethor is senile and crazy,so he won't be a problem, and Dr Faramir is loyal to us.  We're almostfinished with Aruman, so he won't be a problem, either."   "Speaking of which," said Aragon, "where did those orcs really comefrom?  I can't believe Aruman would attack Rohan and risk losing allthe money he's making off them."   "Oh, they're Aruman's alright,"  Gandalf replied.  "They were busyvandalizing Fungang, but I convinced them to attack Rohan on a dareright after I took care of that Balrog. I even had a bunch of helmetsmade up to implicate Aruman, but the stupid smith thought Isaid 'Saruman' and put S-runes on the helms instead of A."   "I was wondering about that myself,"  said Aragon.   "All that leaves is the Shire," continued Gandalf.  "As long as hehas the Ring, Frodo could get in our way, but luckily for us, hedoesn't know how it really works.  He was too busy trying to bag thatTook wench to learn its real powers.  Once he destroys that damnableRing, he'll eliminate both it and Sauron for us.  While he's busy doingthat, we'll liquidate what assets he has left. When we're done withhim, there won't be any place left in Middle-earth for him.  The restof the Shire is ripe for a revolution, thanks to all that time I spentthere over years planting the seeds of revolt.  Once they havetheir 'freedom', you'll be able to secretly control them through theBrandybuck crime syndicate."   The men of Rohan had their barbecue, and lounged around for the restof the afternoon.  Their Dunlending slaves didn't get any rest,though.  First they had to cook the food and serve it.  Then they hadto clean up, and then take down the portable grills.  Needless to say,by the end of the afternoon, they had gotten pretty pissed.   Finally HeyHoDen's curiosity about the poles overcame his laziness,and he gathered his host to set out for Isengard.  There had beencausalties in the battle, which left extra horses, and now no one hadto share horses except for Giggly and Lego-lass.   They folowed Gandalfthrough the poles.   "These poles are strange," said Lego-lass.  "I'd like to find outwhat they are."   "No way, said Giggly.  "It feels like they hate us, and want to killus."   "Not all of us, silly," she said, "just the orcs.  Maybe these polescome from Fungang."   "Well, you're a tree-hugging elf, so I guess you think Fungang iswonderful," said Giggly.  "But I have seen something even better.   "Humans can be so stupid, Lego-lass.  Here they have a naturalwonder, and what do they do with it?  Caves, they say!  Holes toamplify that horrible music from their concerts.  Lego-lass, do youknow that the cave's of Deem's Help are vastly amusing?  I know manydwerrows who would pay pure gold, just to see them and laugh."   "And I would pay double, just to be let out," she snorted, knowingsome of the stupid things Giggly would laugh at.   "Shows what you know," said Giggly.  "I know I laugh a lot, but thesecaves really are funny.  The stalactites, and columns, and everythingelse made me laugh.  And it wasn't just me.  Gambler was laughing hisass off too.  It was pretty dark when we were in there.  I can onlyimagine how funny it would be all lit up.  Just think, cavern aftercavern of funny shapes, deep into the mountain."   "Maybe the Men of Rohan are smart to conceal them," said theelf.  "Just think what damage a single family of dwerrows with hammersand chisels would do to them."   "Spoken like a true elf," said Giggly  "You think that the dwerrowshave no economic sense whatsoever.  But we can recognize a profit whenwe see one, and exploit it.  Hell, we need the revenue, thanks to theelves and Gondor taking advantage of us for centuries.  I couldmake this into a tourist destination: the Giggling Caves of Aglarond, atheme park to rival the Magic Kingdom of Gondor!"   "You move me, Gimli," said Lego-lass.  "Never before have I heard adwerrow actually come up with a sound financial scheme.  But where areyou going to get the money to run your little enterprise?  Everyoneknows the dwerrows are broke.  Let's make a deal -- if you visitFungang with me when all this is over, I'll lend you the money to startup the business, and then we can share the profits."   "Well, I suppose if I have to visit that stupid forest I will," saidGimli.  "But only if you promise to help me with the caves."   "I promise, I promise," said Lego-lass quickly, crossing her fingersbehind her back.  But then some thoughts came unbidden to hermind.  Come to think of it, I won't even have to shell out any of myown money to help him, she thought.  I can just get the money fromDaddy, and if his plan fails, I won't lose anything.  But if hesucceeds, then I get my cut of the money.  But I am definitely notfalling in love with him.   The company rode past the last poles, and headed toward the highwaywhich lead to Isengard.  Lego-lass looked back, and then exclaimed,"Look!  The poles are lighting up!"  Then she turned her horse around,and galloped back toward the poles.  "Ooh, the pretty colors," she said.Giggly was busy having another lauging fit.   "Stop, Lego-lass Greenbutt!"  shouted Gandalf.   "I'd listen to him if I were you," said a strange deep voice with ametallic undertone.  "Those poles are all charged up."  It came from acreature that looked like a walking pole with arms and a bright halogenglare.  He pointed to a large squat box that read in big letters:                        High Voltage                      Do Not Touch Ever                 Especially in ThunderstormsThen more of the same creatures strode out from the poles, with allsorts of different colored lights, bright reds, soft greens, glaringsodium yellows, and neon pinks.  Some actually laughed at the elf,while most of the others walked from pole to pole, checking them. Criesof fear came from the smiths and farmers, and they tightly clutchedtheir pitchforks and pokers.   "Stop!" shouted Gandalf.  "Put your weapons away.  They aren'tenemies, and in fact aren't concerned with you at all."   "Well, what are they, Gandalf?" grumbled HeyHoDen, hoping that thesecreatures did not like barbecue, for it seemed to him like they couldeat a great deal.  "Can't you give us a straight answer for once insteadof all these stupid riddles?"   "Riddles?" asked Gandalf.  "Has your brain become as soft as yourbackside?  Any five-year old could tell you what they are.  You haveseen Ments, HeyHoDen, Ments of Fungang Forest, which you call theMentwood.  Really, how the hell do you think it got that name in thefirst place?"   Before HeyHoDen could answer, Gandalf rode off, and they had littlechoice but to follow him.  Finally they came to the Fords of Isen.This was a wide plain with a hard black ground, where many Fords wereparked.  There were all sorts of makes and models; Model-Ts, Mustangs,even a few scruffy-looking Edsels.  "We wasted enough time barbecuingback at Deem's Help," grumbled Gandalf.  "Everyone get in a Ford, andwe'll drive the rest of the way."  HeyHoDen, Eonard, and Aragon tradedtheir horses for a Mustang, Arwen got in a Model-T, and the others gotin the remaining Fords.  The farmer that had complained so much back atDeem's Help had straggled behind, though, and all that was left for himwas a beat-up old Pinto.   Once upon a time, the men of Atlantis built Isengard at the southend of the Musty Mountains.  However, as the centuries passed, itgenerated no tourist income, and so Gondor sold the property (atwhich time it lost its trademark).  It passed from the hands of onedisreputable owner to another, until finally Aruman came to dwellthere.  He had just recovered from his centuries-long bout ofalcoholism, and decided to make up for his seedy past by doing charitywork.   He had planned to found an orphanage and school for disadvantaged orcboys.  He tore up all the weeds that had choked the grounds for amillenia or so, and planted grass and trees, forming what he hopedwould be a calming environment and thus lessen the homocidal tendanciesinborn in orcs. He failed.  The older boys set up a nasty system ofhazing for the younger boys that actually made things worse.   Eventually Aruman gave up his original plans, and decided to breakthe boys' spirits by using them as child labor.  The serene, almostpastoral landscape of the Wizard's Vale gave way to dormitories andfactories.  All that remained the same within the circle of Isengardwas the tower of Eyesore, the ugliest outcrop of rock in Middle-earth,and the chief cause of Isengard's economic decline.  There the menof Atlantis carved a tower out of the rock, but no one wanted to becaught living there.  Aruman, during his days of recovery, thought thehumiliation would be good for him, after his centuries of dissoluteliving.  Later, he hoped the ugliness of his attempts atindustrialization would make the ugliness of Eyesore less noticeable.   Now Gandalf and the others drove up to the gates of Isengard.  Oncethere were lagre iron gates here, but they had been hurled to theground and crumpled like an aluminum can.  There were large gaps in thewalls, as if something, or rather, a large number of somethings, hadmelted their way through.   Inside, Isengard was filled with bubbling,boiling water.  However, Eyesore stood untouched in the center, as uglyas always.  HeyHoDen and his company sat in the Fords, speechless.They saw that Aruman's School for Boys was no more.  "Damn," thoughHeyHoDen, "so much for television."  Then as he looked away, he noticedtwo small figures sitting next to a large pile of dirty dishes on anoutcrop of melted rock, now cooled.   The company got out of their Fords, and walked up to the figures.One was sleeping, and snoring quite loudly, the other was awake andsmoking, with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.  "Welcome to Isengard," hesaid.  "I am Moribund, of a quite unimportant family.  My companion,"he paused here, firmly kicking the sleeping figure in the ribs with hissteel-toed boots, "is Paragraph Took, son of Palatine, of the house ofTook.  Aruman is busy, so he can't be bothered to see you right now.You'll have to make an appointment."   "Indeed," answered Gandalf.  "Aruman must be getting really cheapif he can't affort better doormen than two ill-mannered louts."   Morrie ignored Gandalf's insult, deciding to pay him backlater.  "Aruman's not in charge anymore.  Isengard's under newmanagement.  Our orders came from Steelbeard."   Giggly couldn't help it any longer.  He burst into laughter.  Afterabout a minute or so, when he was finally able to talk, he said, "Wow,Morrie, I never thought you could be such a joker!"   Before Morrie could retort, HeyHoDen and the others burst intolaughter.  "I take it you know these, uh, men, Gandalf?" HeyHoDenasked.  "Since we've already seen Ments, I'm guessing these are thefabled Halflings?  Little is said about them in Rohan, just that theydwell in a bunch of shacks, and nothing at all about them blowing smokeout of their mouths."   "Really?" said Morrie.  "The weed-trade of Beltbuckleland andBongbottom in the Southfarthing is very profitable, and has been eversince we, ah, acquired the rights to it from Tobold Hornblower.  I'msurprised that no one knows about it."   "That's because of Gondor," said Gandalf.  "They banned weedcenturies ago, when they cleaned up Gondor to make it more family-friendly."   Morrie's jaw began to drop, but then widened into a broad smile as herealized the profit potential of what could be a huge new market in thesouth.  He drew a small pouch out of his pocket.  "Here's a smallsample of weed, my lord," he said.  "If you like it, I can get more foryou, but you'll have to pay for it."   "You do not know your danger, HeyHoDen," interrupted Gandalf.  "TheBrandybucks lace their weed with a substance that makes it highlyaddictive, which ensures that their customers always come back formore.  I should know, since I learned that the hard way," he said,lighting up another pouch of pipe-weed.  Morrie glared angrily at him,but Gandalf ignored him and went on.  "I don't have the time to see youget hooked on a new bad habit right now.  I must speak to Steelbeard.When we're done here, you can talk to Morrie about weed if you want.It's actually quite enjoyable, but first things first."  Morrie decidedthat he didn't need to kill Gandalf after all.   Then Gandalf, HeyHoDen, and the other Rohirrim rode into Isengard tolook for the elder Ment.  Morrie turned to Pipsqueak and whispered,"We're going to make a fortune."
        "Sheesh!" muttered Aragon.  "Why am I stuck here with theselosers when I should be off with the movers and shakers?  Gandalf willpay for this insult!"  Fortunately no one (except Arwen -- and possiblyMorrie, the cat-eared, but he gave no sign) could hear him overGiggly's merriment.        "Where the hell were you guys anyway?" the Dwerrow barelymanaged to enunciate.  "And how did you end up here of all Eru-forsakenplaces, gorging yourselves on pâté à foie gras and tripping!Tripping!  Where did you get the drugs, hosses?  This is so hil... HA!HA! HA! HA!"  Giggly collapsed into hysterics.        "Bongbottom weed, too," observed Aragon, cheering up alittle.  "Pretty valuable stuff  very pure."        "When are you going to kick the habit?" sighed Arwen.        "What I want to know is where they got the wine," said Lego-lass.  "I thought Aruman had outlawed it.  This is supposedly a school,not a saloon, no?"        "What's it to you where we found it?" said Morrie.  "It's here;what's it worth to you?"        Giggly and Aragon bargained hard, but Morrie ended up pocketinga lot of flokarinos.  No one ever got around Morrie the Mean Dude --or at least it was a long walk, especially with the decline of publictransit in the Third Age from the Dark Years when Sauron and Miniwethilmade the Eagles come on time.  But I digress.        Having gobbled their bouillabaisse with cilantro à lanoldoroise with almost indecent haste, the companions sat around for awhile and got stoned.  Aragon lay back and sniffed the white stuff likethere was no tomorrow.        "Look!" squealed Pipsqueak, "Strider the Cokehead is back!"        "I've been back, you bleating idiot!" retorted Aragon.  "Icould have been with the important people -- but nooo!"        "Have some morphine," said Morrie soothingly.  "It'll make youfeel much better."        "Are we going to spend ALL DAY GETTING STONED?" yelled Lego-lass after a couple hours of groovin'.  "What about ANSWERING Giggly'sQUESTION?"        "Well, I woke up to find myself tied up and being lugged aroundby a bunch of nasty snobbish public school brats.  Someone had tied theknots awfully tight, too," said Pipsqueak, glaring at Morrie, who hadan expression of such wide-eyed innocence that Pipsqueak might havebeen accusing him of giving alms to hobbit-orphans (but under the tablehe gave him the special kick that meant "Drop it, unless you want toknow what a Bywater grin feels like).  "The less said about theinitiation rites the better," continued Pipsqueak.  "Let's just saythey put the zing in hazing, and leave it at that."        Pipsqueak went on to give a précis of III.1, which you can readfor yourselves, as I have no intention whatsoever of recapping it; but heleft to Morrie the invidious task of describing the horror of Clarénce,his disgusting pawing, his liquor-laden breath, his insidious cheatingat cricket, his irritating uppah-clawss ahccent, his abominable violinpracticing, and his annoying habit of singing "If I had the Ring of theMaster".  Morrie, true to form, refused to say a word about it, otherthan, "Mordor-Orcs ain't Mother Teresa."        "The educational system in Mordor is a horrible abyss of evil,"intoned Aragon.  "Instead of just teaching the three R's and vocationaled -- the only stuff the lower orders really need to know -- they havethis accursed arts education cruddola.  Frills, I call it."  His eyeswere glazed with horror at the thought, or else mayhap he was onlysuffering a really bad trip.  "I only hope Aruman's school wasn't toocorrupted by that long-haired stuff.  It looks like Sauron and Arumanmust have been allied somehow."  He took another draw. An act was thisfraught with consequences.        Morrie looked at the Ranger contemptuously, but did not tellhim that the Brandibuck mafia had known about the Sauron-Arumanalliance for years, as it had really eaten into their profits.Instead, he abruptly changed the topic.  "Now we're coming to a part ofthe story you don't know anything about. The Ments ..."        "Oh, can I tell them?  Please let me tell it!  PLEASE!"squealed Pipsqueak.  Morrie gave in, only cautioning Pipiqueak notto "spill too much."  Pipsqueak had the sense therefore not to sayanything about Morrie's motives in coming to Isengard in the firstplace (the less outsiders knew about the weed trade, the better; noneed for Aragon to worry about Lotho and all that business -- theBrandibucks could handle it much more effectively).  Nevertheless, hemanaged to swell Book III, Chapter IV to three or four times itsoriginal size, not forgetting to lay great stress on Steelbeard'sresemblance to the Terminator in the celebrated mummers'play, Terminator II.        "I have to admit I had trouble buying Steel's story of thesinging Lion," concluded Pipsqueak.  "Especially the baritone part."        "It's the truth," said Arwen. "He used to appear now and thenduring the Second Age, or so my father told me.  He had a better voicethan Bing Krozbi.  I saw him once as a girl; but he muttered somethingabout this world being rather a waste anyway, and hasn't been seensince."        "Your meriniscences are reeeeeeeally sexy," drawled Aragon,flyin' hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.        "Anyway," said Pipsqueak, deciding he hadn't concluded afterall, "we went on this forced march to Isengard, and the Ments wererapping so loud, we had to stick our twinkies in our ears to avoidbeing deafened.  While this was going on, we passed a bunch of Fords.There was also a sign, where it was written, 'From Sauron to Aruman.Here are those cars you wanted.  Now start enacting democratic reformsand eliminating labor abuses ... and I mean now!!!'"        Aragon frowned at the words "democratic" and "labor."        "Next to them were some opera CDs by a guy named Gaetano ..."        "What's that?" said Arwen.        "Oh Eeeeeeeeeeeeeru ... You don't want to know!" zombed Aragon,moved perhaps by some memory or, more likely, hallucination about histrips to the East.  In after years, by the way, he was known as ElLesser the Tasteless.        "... Metríc, labelled 'Try it, you'll like it!'"  continuedPipsqueak.  "Steelbeard burned down the sign and smashed the CDs,muttering something about the decline of civilization since the FirstAge.        "Nearly forgot to mention that the entire forest of lamppostswas following us by now. Creepy, like something out of a bad sciencefiction mummer's play.  It was the Scruporns, as the Ments call themin 'rude language.'  Steel won't say much about them, but it seems alot of the lampposts malfunctioned after sleeping with Jadis Joplin theScreecher, the White Witch.  Their descendants were born with nastybirth defects, and have the intellectual capacity of an intelligenttoaster, but can still deal out a shock to write home about."        "Steel came and broke down the gates," interposed Moribund,more in order to maintain a simulacrum of variety than because hereally felt like talking. "They looked strong, but Steel and the Mentsmelted them with their woozy-like eyes as if they were made of cheapcardboard.   It seems to me Aruman's pretty wimpy stuff if he's soeasily beaten by a bunch of lampposts out of a really bad cartoon.What's the big deal all about, anyway?  Aruman, Schmaruman, I saying."        "Aruman's smarter than you think," said Aragon.  "He alwaysused to beat Gandalf at Othello like nobody's business.  I didn't tellyou about that at the wake, 'cuz I was too doped and boozed up toremember it.  Moreover, he had a mean PR machine.  Gandalf says Arumanused to make some naaaaasty moonshine, until he quit and startedgetting into that boring charity work stuff instead.  It's almost arelief that he turned his pupils into child labor; at least it showshe's related to Gandalf after all."        "Well, anyway," said Paragraph (so named because he talked inparagraphs instead of sentences), "we saw a bunch of Orcs up to somekind of mischief, yelling things like, 'Amo, amas, I love a lass.'  TheMents tried to kill them, but a mysterious and very fat figure appearedand raised a forcefield, before leading them away.  We don't know whoit was; not Aruman. I think it was ..." Morrie kicked him and hechanged the subject.  "The Ments made a bonfire like the Sun was nevergoing to shine again.  That pyromaniac Steelbeard was having a grandold time.  'Hoom, HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!  This is fun, by the Lion'sMane!' he boomed.  The entire school was demolished, the textbooksburned -- especially the Latin ones..."        "Latin heraus!" yelled Aragon.  Morrie looked at him withannoyance, and wondered whether he should stick to his plan of usingAragon as a puppet, or just get rid of him as soon as Sauron and theother nuisances were overcome.  While he pondered this, Pipsqueak'sinterminable squealing continued.        "Well, anyway," said Pipsqueak rather repetitively, "Aruman'sforces figured out pretty fast the way things were turning, andbolted.  The Ments let most of the Men go, figuring they were probablya typo for Ments; Steel only demanded a few flokarinos from each Man. Idon't think any Orcs survived -- other than the ones that left earlier;they were all massacred."        "Serve 'em right!" said Aragon.  "They're lesser breeds withoutthe law, and must perish.  Natural selection.  Orcs heraus!"        "I dunno," said Lego-lass.  "Giggly and I were wondering aboutthat.  Don't you think it's wrong to wipe 'em out?  Shouldn't we beeducating them about the sanctity of the Market instead?"        "Wrong, but fun; kind of like adultery."  Giggly exploded intoguffaws.  Lego-lass glared at him.        "What is you, a goblin-lover?" sneered Aragon, ignoringGiggly.  "So typical of someone who thinks Balrogs ..." The expressionon Lego-lass's face silenced the Ranger, coupled with the fact that heneeded more cocaine.        "Aruman made a run from one of the burning buildings, takingswigs from a bottle as he ran," was not silent Paragraph. "The Mentsran after them, but then he pointed away and yelled 'There's a bird!'While the Ments looked away, he made a beeline for Eyesore (it deservedits name: it was yoooow-GLEE!) and holed himself in.  There he got hisprecious computers to work, disturbing the Ments' mechanisms with JavaScript errors, The Page Cannot Be Displayed Nyah nyah nyah! messagesand other horrors.  Worst of all was the onslaught of emoticons. Helaughed sarcastically.        "I thought the Ments were mad before, but that was nothing.Have you seen the mummers' play, The Towering Inferno?  That's whatit was like.  That, and a really bad fight scene in one of the StarWars mummers' plays, as Steelbeard and Co. wielded their internallightsabres and expelled some mean photon torpedoes out of variouscavities.  I was scared.  Luckily, Morrie always brings asbestos suitswherever he goes-"        "Like they really needed to know that," grumbled Morrie.        "And then Steel suddenly called the other Ments together overhis PA system.  I think he'd already thought up a plan of his own in hissuperior artificial intelligence system, or maybe he just needed torefuel. Anyway, while they were doing what they do best, Gandalfsuddenly showed up.  I... er... well, keep this private please, because Iprobably shouldn't tell you it, but my vocal chords have rather a mindof their own, and don't know how to stop-"        "You can say that again," muttered Morrie, which Pipsqueakpromptly did before continuing.        "Well, I was kind of not happy to see the codger back, to tellthe truth.  I nearly spilt my latte in my chagrin, but I managed to gaspout, 'Gandalf!  I was hop... er... I thought you were dead!"        "'The feeling is mutual, you pitiful little rodent half-breed,"hissed Gandalf, before kind of half-laughing to make me think it was ajoke. 'Where in the name of instant messaging is Steelbeard?  I need totalk to him pronto!'"  I pointed the way to a building (one of the fewleft standing) marked 'Maintenance Workers Only.'  He came out havingsome kind of altercation with Steel; I caught the words 'I can breakyou,' but not much else, as I was tripping on peyote at the time.        "When I came down, I saw that the Scruporns had plantedthemselves all over the schoolyard.  It wasn't an appropriate place forOrc-children to hang out, I'm here to tell you.  Morrie and I lookedaround for eats.  We nabbed a bunch of rabbits; they were horriblycute, and begged us not to kill them.  'I'm Fwopsy,' said one.  'I'mMopsy,' said the second one.  'I'm Cottontail,' said the third.  'I'mMichael Jackson,' said the fourth.  I wanted to spare them, but Morriecan be brutal when necessary. He called me an incurable romantic!  Wefound a lot of other good stuff, too.  Morrie has a nose."  Pipsqueakwas on a roll, and there was no stopping him now, for Morrie was stilllost in plans for world domination and kneecapping his enemies, and waspaying no attention to the stream of blather that issued forth fromPipsqueak's mouth like unto a rushing torrent of squeaks.  "We foundAruman's cabinet, the one marked "Top Secret.  Don't Let Sauron orMiniwehtil See Contents."        "Who's Miniwethil?" asked Giggly.  "And if it was so topsecret, why wasn't it in Eyesore?"        "It wasn't in Eyesore because Miniwethil was," explainedPipsqueak.  "And Miniwethil was some rodent broad Aruman hung out with.She had chîchiz like succulent peaches! Last I saw, Steel wasdragging her somewhere and she was screaming.  I'm guessing she came toa bad end."         "She was for long Sauron's mistress -- she was quite thevamp," said Arwen.  "I never understood what the big deal was; didpeople get turned on by those mouse-ears? I fought her with namuchakusonce. During the First and Second Ages she and Sauron wrought muchevil, like the forty-hour work week, free ballet and sung mummers'plays, and sex education. At the end of the Second Age they had afalling out."        "Rumor has it that she tried to bobbitt the Dark Lord, but bitoff the wrong portion of his anatomy," said Aragon, coming out of hismorphine-induced stupor. "Then she transferred her attentions toIsildur, and together they conceived Anarchion the SartoriallyChallenged Waterfowl.  After Isildur met his untimely end at thehands of Black Pete (leading to the Gondorians' famous Racism), shemoved in with Aruman.  Meanwhile Anarchion begat-" Arwen quicklycovered Aragon's mouth, as she always did whenever he uttered theword "begat."        "Enough amusing -- or not so amusing -- narrativeirrelevancies," she muttered.  "They eat up too many damn kilobytes."        "Next time we saw Steel, he seemed kind of ticked off," saidMorrie.  "'You didn't give me a lot of info earlier,' he grumbled.'Didn't you trust me?'  He seemed kind of hurt when I told him 'No.'Like it says on the Brandibuck coat of arms, 'Don't trust nobody butyour crowbar.'  'Then what the Angband use are you losers?' he whined.He gave me a mild electric shock.  When my crime syndicate takes over,he'll wish he hadn't."        By now Pipsqueak had, unfortunately, woken up.  The torrentrecommenced.  The others zoned out on drugs; it was the only way theycould survive Pipsqueak's incessant bleating.  At least the blatherersat El Rond's Council had mostly had pleasant baritones.  Even Gigglyhad given up waiting for the punchline.   "Gandalf turned up again andtold us a bit about Frodo and Sam.  But we were more concerned with youguys..."        "After all," put in Morrie, "that estate in Mordor is all verywell and good (or would be if they didn't have so much damnedregulation in Mordor).  But the United Kingdom means a Global Market,and that means..." He rubbed his fingers together in the ancient hobbitgesture for what, in Elvish, is called mucha múla.        "Suddenly we smelt fumes of a mysterious substance that Steelcalled gasolinorpetrolbenzinorwhateverdahellyawannakallit," continuedPipsqueak.  "A slimy, malodorous liquid flooded Isengard.  It was likebubbling, boiling water with a bad case of halitosis. 'They want toeliminate Aruman by destroying his habitat; pretty clever,' as oldMorrie explained. The Scruporns meanwhile filled everything with anunbearable red light.   Steel and whatnot burned the gaso... stuff andcaused nasty exhalations of some flaming substance or other..."        At the word "flaming," Aragon woke up and lit a cigarettebefore remarking, "Yeah, we saw that. We thought Aruman was dreaming upsome new devilry, or else that he'd developed a wicked new form of weed."        "Not he!" bleated Pipsqueak.  "He was probably choking and notlaughing anymore.  We managed to hole ourselves in this tower with thecabinet with lots of cool secret stuff..."  Morrie twirled his walkingstick idly. Pipsqueak took the hint and changed the topic.  "Today waspretty much a drag.  Nothing left to eat but pâté à foie gras and otherhaute cuisine, no news, no Ments... they were all at a party and wouldn'tlet us come.  'No rat-folk allowed,' as Steel put it.  Instead we hadto wait at the gate for HeyHoDen and whatnot."        "Worth the wait, though," said Moribund.  "We've got vast newmarkets just waiting to be opened up."        "True," said Paragraph.  "Oh, I almost forgot to mention thisguy named Grimey..."        "No!" said Aragon, in a voice full of what he meant to soundlike majesty, although he gave more the impression of an overgrownspoiled brat.  "I will not listen to any more of your world-without-endsquealing. I do not want to know how Grimey came, nor what evil plotshe's been hatching with Aruman.  I do not even want to know how he gotout of Edoras, where he was locked last I knew.  I only want to knowone thing, and after that you are to shut up.  How much, in the name ofSteamboat Willie, are you willing to give for those silver beltthings?"  Giggly chortled at the recollection of how the belts chimedthe Happy Birthday song when Aragon picked them up.        Morrie, after calmly and efficiently gagging Pipsqueak, saidnonchalantly, "It would be a pity if your drug supplies dried up."        Aragon groaned and forked over the belts, while Arwen sighed.
     The companions lay at their ease for some time, trying to unblurtheir vision and occasionally throttling Pipsqueak to prevent him fromtalking any more. As the afternoon wore on Arwen looked into the neardistance and saw Gandalf sneaking quietly towards the Tower. "Something'sup," she said in a hushed whisper, checking her slipknives. "Come on. We'dbetter see what he's up to."     Quickly the companions arose, and began the trek towards the wizard.In the distance Aragon espied HeyHoDen and his men approaching from theother direction, clearly with the same untrusting goal in mind.     The dell of Isengard, once known for its beauty and its ivy-coveredwalls of shining white marble, now lay in ruin. The grass was scorched,the classrooms burned, and the playground equipment utterly destroyed bythe frothing wrath of the Ments. Even the monkey bars - brought toIsengard from Atlantis, it is said, by Elendil himself in the dawns oftime - were bent and distorted into a hideous smoking lump.     Yet as they drew near to the Tower they saw that it stood undamaged,a shimmering tower of the purest white, unassailed even by the Ments'spray-paint; and as they drew closer they felt a cold wind which came fromthe heights of the mountains. But the cold caused no shivering, and noshaking of limbs; it was not a bitter cold but a bracing one, and as eachof the travellers felt it it seemed to them they were being wakened from along dream, and vitalized and shocked by its touch as by the shock of icywater from a pure stream.     I have been a fool! Pipsqueak thought, with a sudden sense ofrevelation. This is all wrong. I should have stayed at home. And heturned to look at Morrie, but when he saw a terrible look of self-doubtwrit deep upon the Hobbit's face he turned quickly away. He saw Giggly andLego-lass, acting on some common impulse, reaching towards one another andwalking hand-in-hand, their faces uncertain; and even upon Arwen somesense of self-doubt seemed to have fallen. "Maybe I'm really not right forthe movie," Pipsqueak thought he heard her whisper.     Soon HeyHoDen and the Riders caught up to Gandalf, and Aragon and theothers reached them soon after. Gandalf quickly turned to Aragon. "I haveto visit Aruman," he said quickly, an ashen look on his face. "Dangerous,and probably useless; but it must be done. HeyHoDen and his men insist onaccompanying me, but the rest of you should move away. Too dangerous."     "I'm coming anyway," Giggly announced. "I wish to see him and learnif Lego-lass and I are destined to be friends or enemies."     "And how will you learn that, Master Dwark?" Gandalf said hotly."Aruman could tell you whatever you wanted to hear. Are you wise enough tolisten to the Truth? Uh, not that he'd tell it, of course," he addedhastily. "He's a consummate liar, you know. It's dangerous to listen tohim, whatever else you may do. Beware of his voice!"     They came now to the foot of the Tower. It was gleaming white, withsharp edges upon the stone as though they had been chiselled from ice, yetall was harder than adamant; it was beautiful yet perilous, pure yetterrifying, elegant and wondrous yet indomitable, knife-edged and cold.Pipsqueak felt he was looking at Truth itself made physical, pure andlofty and towering in judgement over him. He felt very small, dishonestand afraid.     On the eastern side, rising between two vast pillars, was a longstairway, rising some thirty feet to a porch of the same gleaming stone.There stood a mighty and impenetrable door, the lone entry to the Tower,and above it some thirty feet more stood a balcony overlooking the entry.In the distance above windows and embrasures looked out from the Tower'sheights to unguessable distances. All things were visible from Isengard.     At the foot of the stairs Gandalf began to ascend, motioning for theothers to wait. "I will go up alone," Gandalf announced. "I have been aprisoner in Isengard before, and know my peril."     "And I too will go up," said the King, ascending after him. "I amold, and fear no peril any more. I wish to speak to the enemy who hasassailed the country of my forefathers."     "Uhm, well, okay, if you insist," Gandalf answered. "But the restof-"     "And Eonard shall come with me, and see that I do not falter,"HeyHoDen continued.     "Well, that's really not necessary-" Gandalf choked.     "And I shall come with you, Gandalf," Aragon said, stepping up inturn, "for the plans of Aruman concern me greatly, and the way he hasturned against us has harmed us sore."     "Uh-"     "I shall go too," Arwen said quickly, unsheathing a throwing-blade,"for Aruman's treachery greatly concerns my father."     "No, really, this'll be easier if you all wait down below," Gandalfinsisted.     "Nay!" added Gimli. "Lego-lass and I alone represent our kindreds. Weshall also come up to see what we may."     "And I too!" said Pipsqueak, mounting the stairs to his own surprise."There is something here, some terrible truth, which I must learn. Morrieshall come with me," he added. Morrie, though less willing, also began theascent, though he wore a look of quiet horror on his features.     "Hoom! And I too!" added Steelbeard, coming unexpectedly around theside of the pillar. "This Aruman is a, hoom, well, a killer of lightbulbs,a breaker of lamps. He shall soon be set to our account, hoom!"     "Oh, fine," Gandalf said resignedly. "Why not invite Aunt Doris andthe kiddies, too? Why not sell tickets? Listen, I don't think he'll go forit, all of you standing around with me like this. The porch is gettingcrowded! Aruman doesn't even have enough chairs for all of us. Will youall go right back down these stairs? I'm telling you, he won't come out!He'll be shy about being seen before so many eyes - Don't do that!" heyelled suddenly, as Aragon unthinkingly pulled the bell-cord.     For a moment there was no answer. Gandalf turned to the others."There, you see?" he said quickly. "Nobody home. Just like I said. Now, ifyou had heeded my-"     "Look!" Eonard said suddenly.     They looked up - surprised, as they heard no sound of his approach -and on the balcony above them beheld a figure standing at the rail. Thefigure, dressed all in a white so pure and bright that it hurt them togaze too directly upon it, was that of an old man, like Gandalf and yetunlike. For his eyes were dark, and deeper than Gandalf's, and the lookthey now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary; and he wasseveral pounds lighter. Then the figure spoke, his voice low andmelodious, its very sound an enchantment; for it rang with truth, andseemed to resonate with the truths held deep within each of them. Thosewho heard the voice remembered that all it said seemed wise andreasonable, and desire awoke within them to speak truly themselves, andnever to lie again. "Well?" it said now with gentle question. "Why must you disturb me further? Will you give me no peace at all by night or day?"Its tone was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved.     "But come now," the voice continued. "Two of you at least I know byname. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks counselhere. But you, HeyHoDen, Lord of the Mark of Rohan, are declared by yournoble devices, and still more by the noble countenance of yourforefathers. Why have you not come before, and as a friend? Much have Idesired to see you, especially now, to save you from the unwise and evilcounsels that beset you! Is it yet too late? Despite the injuries thathave been done to me - in which, alas! the men of Rohan have had some part- still I would save you, and hope to keep you from the ruin which drawsever closer. Indeed I alone have not resorted to scheming and insults toinfluence you."     HeyHoDen opened his mouth as if to speak, but said nothing. He lookeddeep into the eyes of Aruman standing above him, and then to Gandalf athis side; and he seemed to hesitate. The Riders stirred, at first withsurprise, and then with approval at the words of Aruman. It seemed to themthat Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord, alwaysgiving half-lies and bad punchlines instead. And they were right. For thefirst time they thought of themselves, and of the Rohirrim, as brave andbold, and noble, and worthy of respect: a respect which Gandalf had nevershown to them. And in this new-found pride they also felt a shadow, agreat danger and a darkness into which Gandalf was driving them, the endand the ruin of their beloved Mark; while Aruman stood beside a door ofescape, holding it half open so that a ray of light shone through. Therewas a heavy silence.     It was Giggly the dwarf who broke in suddenly. "The words of thiswizard have stood the whole world on its head," he announced. "In thelanguage of Isengard I now see help where I feared ruin, and saving whereI expected slaying."     "Peace!" said Aruman. "I do not speak to you yet, Giggly of theDwarves. Pray allow me first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbor,and once my friend.     "What have you to say, HeyHoDen King? Will you have peace with me,and all the aid that my knowledge, founded in long years, can bring? Shallwe make our counsels together against evil days, and repair our injurieswith such good will as we may find? Shall we have peace, you and I? It isours to command."     "We will have peace," HeyHoDen answered at last, thickly and with aneffort. Several of the Riders cried out gladly, till HeyHoden lifted hishand. "Yes, we will have peace," he continued, "we will have peace, whenyou and all your works have perished - and the works of your foul masterto whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Aruman, and a corrupter ofmen's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I see only a finger of theclaw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! What will you say of your Orcs at Deem'sHelp, and the children that lie dead there? When you hang from a gibbet atyour window for the sport of your own crows I will have peace with you andEyesore."     The Riders gazed at HeyHoDen like men startled from a fair vision.Yet Aruman, standing above them all, seemed more puzzled than startled."My Orcs at Deem's Help?" he asked. "What about my Orcs at Deem's Help?Nothing went wrong there, surely?"     "Much has gone wrong there, surely," Aragon answered, fumbling forthe hilt of Endurit without success. "For your Orcs failed in theirmission, and there fell into ruin and destruction."     "They were destroyed?" Aruman gasped. "You're telling me the Orcswere destroyed? But Gandalf, you said you were taking them on afield-trip--"     "What's this?" HeyHoDen growled, reaching for his own sword-hilt.     "Lies! All lies!" Gandalf said suddenly. "Beware of his voice!"     "--a field trip to study Rohirric architecture," Aruman continued."And you said HeyHoDen knew all about it, and had approved it. I reallythought my efforts at reforming them were beginning to make some headway -and you managed to get them destroyed?"     "Ah ha ha ha haaa," Gandalf replied suavely. "But that was revenge.For they attacked our Fellowship, they did. And they kidnapped these twoHobbits! Yes! Yes, they did, Some pretty reforming going on at Isengard,I must say."     Steelbeard stopped and shuffled his feet.     "Why would I want Hobbits kidnapped?" Aruman asked, genuinelypuzzled. "I have never wanted to disturb their quiet country. Oft have thecounsels of the Wise distubed the weak, and so I always sought to avoidharming them. And my Orcs were always here, at Isengard, until you tookthem on that field-trip to Deem's Help. So they couldn't have kidnappedanyone."     "But you had us kidnapped by your Orcs!" Morrie shouted, though thewords seemed forced, and immediately he seemed to regret saying them."They had that stupid school-armour and everything," he ended lamely.     "You mean the school-armour I gave him?" Aruman said, looking atGandalf.     Gandalf said nothing. "What do you mean, gave him?" Pipsqueak saidslowly.     "We just bought new uniforms for the school," Aruman answered. "Igave the old armour to Gandalf. He said he had some charitable causes tocontribute it to."     "Hoom," Steelbeard said uncertainly.     "Well," Gandalf answered. "Uh."     "Are you saying Gandalf had the Orcs attack Deem's Help?" HeyHoDensaid, a sinister tone in his voice. "Gandalf sent troops to defile theMark?"     "Well, what does that matter to anyone important?" Gandalf exploded."Dotard! What is the house of Yorl but a thatched barn where brigandsdrink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor with their dogs?"     Eonard and the Riders slowly drew steel in the ensuing silence. "Foryour insolence alone I would have you slain. Yet there are other reasons,"he said with unaccustomed anger.     "Uhm, now, let's all calm down," Gandalf replied, recovering hiswits. "I misspoke in my anger, that's all. Aruman's lying to you of theOrcs. And he's lying about the kidnappings, too! He arranged all that."     "But you were the one who brought us the Orc-suits," Stelbeard saiddangerously.     "Uhm," Gandalf swallowed. "I was just duped. By Aruman. He's yourenemy. Really."     "He brought you the Orc-suits?" Morrie demanded of Steelbeard.     "Hoom! Yes! Gandalf said, Wear these! Make yourselves look likeOrcs. Then wear some tree-suits over them as camouflage. And Gandalfsaid: It's necessary. We have to make Aruman look guilty of everything.And he said: Here's what Orcs in the public schools act like. Say thesethings. And he said: Don't worry about the real Orcs! I'll make surethey'll never get a chance to testify. And he said: Do this, and I'llfind the Ment-Fillies for you! And so we did it. Hoom! And now Gandalfwill find our Fillies for us, yes he will. Or else it will go hard forhim, hoom, very hard," Steelbeard said acridly.     "So you kidnapped us?" Morrie suddenly screamed, his face ashen."You dressed up as Orcs and kidnapped us? I made you all thosepromises?"     "At Gandalf's urging?" Pipsqueak snapped.     "I knew it!" Morrie realized. "I thought something seemed wrongwith those Orcs. Too stiff, or something. I knew it!"     "And for this, Gandalf promised you the Ment-Fillies?" Aruman asked,looking down at Steelbeard with wide eyes.     "Hoom! Yes!" Steelbeard answered, his voice shaking the very ground."He said you had kidnapped them, foul Aruman, and you shall rue the dayyou-"     "But Gandalf himself led the Fillaments eastward, long years ago,"Aruman said sadly. "He said he needed their help. None ever returned. Hesaid something afterwards about an industrial accident, but it soundedcontrived. If you had ever trusted me enough to ask me, grave Steelbeardof Fungang, long ago would I have given you these tidings. But always tillnow you mistrusted me, and now I fear your hope is in vain."     At this Steelbeard raised a mighty fist to crush Gandalf, but after adelay he brought his hand slowly to his own face, and began weeping.     "But you, Gandalf! For you at least I am grieved, feeling for yourshame. How comes it that you can use such treachery? For are these liesand plottings not the very tools of the Enemy? I endeavoured to advise youat our last meeting, but you turned away. Even now will you not listen tomy counsel?"     Gandalf, not wishing to look at the others, looked up. "What have youto say that you did not say at our last meeting?" he asked. "Or, perhaps,you have things to unsay?"     Aruman paused. "Unsay?" he said, as if stunned. "Unsay? I endeavouredto advise you for your own good, but scarcely you listened. You are proudand do not love advice, having indeed a store of your own wisdom. And whynot? Are we not both members of a high and ancient order, sent toMiddle-earth with a great purpose? Much we could still accomplishtogether, to heal the disorders of the world. Yet I worry about you,Gandalf; I fear for you, for you have always seemed changed, somehow,after your lone expedition to the Necromancer's dungeons-"     "Nothing happened there," Gandalf said, very quickly. "Nothing atall. I found Thrag and the map there. Didn't get caught. By anybody."     "You were gone for eight months," Aruman said quietly.     "But I didn't get caught," Gandalf said again. "I never saw Him.Never, never, never. I don't know why you keep asking. Nobody else asks.It didn't happen."     "Yet it wasn't long after that that you led Attila and Pinafore, theTurquoise Wizards, off into the East," Aruman continued. "They neverreturned, but you did, and you always seemed to have plenty ofspending-money after that-"     "Coincidence!" Gandalf shouted.     "-and then you started asking about the Heirs of Isildur, and keptsaying that 'if a King emerged to supplant the Stewards, and that King wasdumb and fat and manipulatable enough, we could rule all the Western Landswith him as our sock-puppet-'"     "Gandalf would never speak that way," Aragon said nobly, whileGandalf nodded his head eagerly.     "Well, yes, he did," Aruman continued. "At a Council of the Wise. ElRond and Galadriel each heard him. El Rond actually thought it a goodidea..."     There was a shhgnnngk as Endurit finally came free of its scabbard."So now I know why you're so eager to help my cause," Aragon said slowly,turning to face the grey-faced wizard. "'Fat'? You really said 'fat'?"     "Oh, calm down," Gandalf replied hastily. "I never said that.Remember, Aruman is a damn liar! He held me prisoner, remember? Hefought us-"     "I never held you prisoner," Aruman said, amazed.     "-at every turn, he fought us all! He's on Sauron's side! Not me!Him! Just look at him!" Gandalf pointed up at Aruman, raging, stabbinghis finger upward. "Can you imagine what he would do if he had the OneRing? He'd enslave us all!"     "No, I wouldn't," Aruman said with annoyance. "None of the Istaricould! Any of us who wore the One Ring would be immediately destroyed. ByEru. In a bolt of lightning. Instantly. That was the agreement we made,all of us, before we left! Only the lesser Rings could be worn, if wedared. Never the One!"     "A likely story," Gandalf said, sweating.     "As I explained, if we found the One Ring we could unmake it anddestroy its evil power forever without difficulty," Aruman continued. "Onany night at moonrise, with the proper spell. Not for nothing did I studythe ancient Ring-lore!"     "What?" Morrie and Pipsqueak shouted together. "But Frodo--"     "But we must throw the Ring into Mount Viagra to destroy it. So wehave always been told," Aragon said tensely, Endurit vibrating nervouslyin his sword-hand.     "That? An old wives' tale," Aruman shrugged. "Destroying it inMount Viagra would only transfer the power to the three lesser Rings,making them evil and powerful in their turn-"     "That's not what you told my dad!" Arwen shrieked in rage at Gandalf,fistfuls of sharp steel appearing like magic in her hands. "You told himthe exact opposite! You bastard!"     "Hoom! Traitor!" Steelbeard added, again raising his fist.     "I, uh, I need to leave now," Gandalf said suddenly, and turned torun.     "Come back, Gandalf!" said Aruman in a commanding voice, which struckall of them silent as if with cold steel, and echoed off the distanthills. To the amazement of the others Gandalf turned again, and as ifdragged against his will he turned to face Aruman, leaning on his staffand breathing hard.     "I did not give you leave to go," Aruman continued. "You have becomea fool, Gandalf, and yet pitiable. You might have still turned away fromfolly and evil, and have been of service. Instead you wish to enmesh usall in a plot of your own. But I warn you, you will not so easily-"     "Lies! Lies! Beware of his voice!" Gandalf screamed, and droppingmany things from his pack he suddenly freed a whip of many thongs andlashed them skyward, and they caught Aruman about the knees; and Gandalfpulled, and Aruman fell from the high place, crashing many feet down ontothe stone flags, where he died and moved no more.     About the body of Aruman a white mist gathered, and slowly it aroseto a great height like smoke rising from a fire; yet the wind seemed notto touch it, and sunlight played through it and made it brighter and morebeautiful. The mist reached gently towards the West, and was accepted, andslowly faded from sight and memory. Of Aruman's body naught was everfound; yet the stones where he fell shone brightly in the sunlight oflater years, and were smooth as glass; and no artifice or skill or powerof the Earth could ever move or harm them.     "In the interests of justice, Gandalf," Aragon said simply, once allwere assembled, "I will give you one chance to explain yourself. Only thenshall we put you to death."     "Of course," Gandalf replied. "I know you have many questions, yet Ifeel certain I can answer them all. To your complete satisfaction. Butit's been a hot afternoon! My throat is parched. Before I explain, couldwe at least have a drink?"     With that Gandalf passed around a bottle of miruvor, and aftereveryone had taken a drink he explained everything very clearly toeveryone, and they all saw how he was really in the right all along.Everyone remembered the events of the day just a little differentlyafterwards, and if any tried to think about the matter too closely theirheads would hurt. Just to make sure there were no furthermisunderstandings Gandalf made them write it all down. "So! You see? Itwas Aruman who was allied with Sauron all along," he concluded.     "I, uh, I guess you're right," Arwen said slowly, echoing the commonsentiment. "At least I can't think of why not, for some reason. Boy, do Ihave a headache."     "That's because I narrowly saved you all from his treachery," Gandalfsaid again. "Remember, I'm on your side. Do as I tell you from now on, andeverything will be fine! And for starters, you, Pipsqueak, will come helpme pick up my stuff." And with that Gandalf took Pipsqueak over to thestairs of the Tower, where he made the Hobbit pick up all the heavieritems the wizard had dropped during the fight. Pipsqueak lugged everythingover to Gandalf's horse. "What is this?" he asked of one particularlyheavy item which had caught his fancy.     "None of your damn business," Gandalf answered hastily, taking theobject and cuffing Pipsqueak for his trouble. "Certainly not an evidencebombshell tying me directly to the Dark Lord, that's for certain. Nowleave me alone."
     The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountainswhen Gandalf and companions, and the king with his riders, and thelocal levies, and the Levis from the shul down the mountain Mishigäs,and Uncle Tom Cobley and all rode off.     Ments in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with theirlong arms uplifted with flickering lights at their ends, but they madeno sound, unlike the statues in their hometown, which were quitegarrulous, and kept common folk awake all night.      They came to the Pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was stillstanding but most of the graven hand had been thrown down except forone long finger, which was still standing, but had been stained withsome dark substance.     "Truly it is said that when the Ments turn to proctology theworld trembles!" remarked Gandalf with a shudder.     They rode on, clenching their sphincter muscles.     This clenching had its usual effect on horseback riders, andMorrie finally whined, "Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf?"     "No," replied Gandalf. "I want to put some distance between usand those insidious works of Aruman. Every time I think of the terriblethings that he did to so many people, well it frays my temper and Ifeel like going back and spitting on where he fell one more time. Why,every time I think of what he said about you, Morrie, it just makes meboil!"     "Huh," said Morrie, his usual sinister look of malicious stupidityturning to one of baffled malicious stupidity, "What things? I don'tremember him saying anything about us, although," he added shaking hishead slowly as if it hurt, "everything about that seems kinda fuzzy."     "Why, yes," said Gandalf quickly. "Better for you not to dwell onit, how he called you a pimple-faced goon who displays all thecharacteristics of a reverse Darwinism, a walking advertisement forthe sterilization of the morally unfit and someone who he was notsurprised was running a brisk trade in pipe weed to loose girls at thelocal high school."     "He said that, the Schmööck!" snarled Morrie. "Hey, wait a minute,how did he know about the pipe weed thing?"     "Well," said Gandalf, picking up the pace a little, "erh, I fearthat we may find that Aruman's appendages have reached further than wethought!  Indeed, I fear we may find the Shire in the hands of aextremely strong but fair criminal organization dedicated to enslavingyoung Hobbit lasses into lives of prostitution and support for theUnited Nations, and producing a vile crop of pipe weed."     "WaitaErudamnminute," bellowed Morrie as he galloped after, "thatwas my plan!"     Soon after they stopped and got off their horses with many agrimace and groan and soon dispersed themselves, several of the olderRohan troopers pairing off with others beneath the hanging branches ofnearby trees, humming airs of old Rohan operas and show tunes as theyspread single blankets out for both men.     Several of the other troopers chuckled as Morrie and Pipsqueakspread their blankets, with many comments about Hobbit Holes not beingdirty places, heh, heh.      Morrie was sleepy, particularly after sampling more of the weedhe had salvaged from the wrack of Eyesore. Pipsqueak was more rest-less, and the conversation kept coming back to the white ball he hadglimpsed. "That glass ball now. Gandalf seemed mighty pleased with itI reckon, sho nuff. He knows some'at 'bout it, but do he tell us, Ireckon not. Nawsuh, he doesn't tell us in nowt in a coon's age. Din't I pick it up and I sure enough saved it dat der ball fromrolling into a pool. It felt right heavy as I live and breathe."     Morrie glowered at him from under sleepy brows, "If you don'tstop talking in politically incorrect dialect, I'm going to kick yoursorry butt into that there briar patch. Shaddap, I haven't had anocturnal emission in the longest time and you're keeping me from it!"     And murmuring the name of "Rambling" Rosie, he fell asleep.     Pipsqueak said no more and rubbed his groin where Morrie hadkicked him. At last he could stand it no longer.      He crept down to where Gandalf was sleeping. Driven by someimpulse that he could not understand, but which was probably rootedin an early childhood glimpse of his mother in the bath, he movedcloser until he could spy something bulging in a fold of the cloth.Pipsqueak reached down and put his hands on it and as he did Gandalfstirred in his sleep and murmured "Arwen, my nymphette, humbert, humbert,hummmmm...." Pipsqueak hastily let go and grabbed the other bundle andran off.     Much later there was a loud noise, sending the camp into a tizzy. Gandalf ran up, buttoning himself and wiping away at something. "Sothis is the thief" said Gandalf. He booted Pipsqueak where he lay,explaining that this would help him revive. It took several more suchattempts and several blows to the head before Pipsqueak revived.      As he lay blinking, he was showered with questions until finally...     "Wait!" cried Gandalf. "Let him tell it in his own way."     Pipsqueak shuddered as he remembered when he had unwrapped thestone from his cloak, wiping off the grease and egg stains it hadpicked up from his cloak with an equally grotty pocket handkerchiefembroidered with the initials TB.     He remembered peering into it intently for a few moments untilit began to glow. Gradually arcane words began to appear, words thatseemed to have a certain malignancy in their form and content.      Gradually he began to make them out, his lips sounding them out(usually with highly unorthodox pronunciations), and as he did so hebegan a counterpoint of cursing under his breath as the words read:"I'm sorry, we are unable to complete your Palantarium connection atthis time, please try again later." After a long interval the wordschanged; he began to curse again as they read, "Your Palantarium isnot configured correctly/is not set up to work with Atlantis on Line.Please check your settings and try again later."      Muttering about the curse of the Aölhëllïïm, he tried severalmore times before he finally was connected.     At first, all seemed blackness. Then he saw the outline of astark and severe hooded and cloaked figure. To his horror (overtaxingunderutilized sphincter muscles) it moved closer and closer untilall he could see were the figure's red-rimmed eyes in a gaunt andsinister face. "Tell me!" it demanded, "Your puny powers are of noconcern to me! Have you found the one I seek? And what of the shortcreatures? Oh, and by the way, I am afraid that your friends will findthe force field fully operational and the Death Star as well!!!"     It was at this point that Pipsqueak realized that he had not theslightest idea what was going on (this was not a new occurrence tohim, having occurred to him frequently in the half semester he hadattended school and frequently thereafter when he was asked to explainthe presence of other people's property in his possession). As hisusual expression of mulish stupor deepened into total bafflement, thefigure in the stone realized it and said "Hmm, you're not an Ewok,you're not one of mine." The figure turned his head and called offPipsqueak's line of sight of the image in the stone, "Sorry, SauryHoney, the call's for you." Pipsqueak could almost he the sound ofwater dripping from, as it were, a shower head of antique andunfathomable evil; he heard the sound of two floppy shower slipperscoming closer and closer. Finally a face was revealed to him, a facethat seemed to have supped on bowels of incalculable depravity andunspeakable practices, a face that fairly reeked with a gelid scornand disdain, a face wrapped in a pink fluffy bath towel, a face thatresembled most that of...     Well, you know who.     "Mercifully," Pipsqueak said, "at that moment I slipped intooblivion or my own poop after I cut loose with a dump. The shriek youheard was a fart. A damn good one too!" he said with much contentmentas the bystanders proceeded to mutter and to move upwind of him as heshook a pants leg.     Gandalf looked down at him. Then he sighed and carried Pipsqueakback to his bed. "He will take no hurt from this, I do swear; he ismuch too dense to comprehend most of what goes on around him, letalone this." And as he turned away, he lit slip his exasperationsufficiently to flick out with a swift kick to the posterior of theunconscious form that had slipped instantly into sleep after Gandalfhad whacked the Palantarium against the back of his head. Otherspassed by silently and also similarly saluted the form of the cause ofthe interruption of their slumber or other activities until his bedplace was moved several spans down the hillside from their kicks.     [And where was Arwen when all of this was going on? Well mightyou wonder, dear reader. In fact, as will be made clear in the nextedition of History of Muddle Earth, More fag-end Rejects that I cansucker people into buying, you will see how Arwen, Giggly and Lego-lass made a side trip to beat up Dunlendings (and getting paid verywell by the Pinkuton Agency, I might add). You'll thrill to her featsof prowess, her stark blood lust and carving of new entrances into theanatomy of Dunlendings, all to be featured in the new movie "Arwen: Warrior Princess!" I hope this explains the lacunae in this chapter(not that I mind lacunae, of course (actually, there's nothing betterthan a nice hot lacunae, with whipped cream on it of course (thewhipped cream is optional (don't you love parenthesis (I do)?)))]     Ahem.     As Gandalf turned away Aragon confronted him, a look of peevisharrogornance mixed with a certain cunning on his face. "Here is onewho can claim this by right. I believe this is the Palantarium thatmy second cousin Poindexteran had from his uncle. I will take it."     Gandalf looked at Aragon, then to the surprise of others hepassed it to him, murmuring under his breath: "Just wait until hefinds out that the parental controls are activated."     Gandalf said, "Receive it, Lard, but ware! Oft things mayglister but not be gold."     Aragon replied, "Yet, a stitch in time may save nine."     Gandalf replied, "Yes, but for want of a nail."     Aragon returned, more shortly, "A gherkin may be wrinkled butit's not old."     Gandalf, annoyed, said "Enough of this proverbial badinage! Wemust away to the next chapter!"
     Frodo woke with a splitting headache which was made worse when he realizedthat nothing that painful could be a dream.     "Where am I - and why is everything so loud,"  he said before changingto a whisper.  Oh, this was a bad one alright.     "You are in the Last Homely House  or the first  or maybe neither, asmany homely houses have been built before and after this one. Suffice it to saythat it is the house of El Rond and he's been hard at work up until last nighttrying to save your silly mortal hide."     The voice was that of Gandalf's and Frodo never imagined any voice couldbe as loud as what he was hearing right now.  "Could you show some respect andkeep it down.  Please.  People are busy dying here."     "Oh its not that bad, you could be dead already."  Gandalf had turned awayfrom the sideboard he had been standing at and was approaching Frodo with afluted glass with a green concotion in it.  "Here.  Drink this, it will helpyou get over the hang..., I mean, headache that you have.  It has been closethese past four days and we had to keep you well sedated while we forced theblood toward your brain again.  Nasty work that was.  We didn't finish untillast night.  Oh, by the way, don't worry, some women find scars sexy."     I don't know which, Gandalf thought to himself, but I'm sure there must beat least one somewhere.     "Four days!" cried Frodo.  "You mean I haven't eaten in four days?!?! Get something in here right now!  And make sure there are plenty of mushrooms!"     "Well, at least you seem to have your spirit back.  Although you seem toforget that you're on the lam and are owing your well being to others.  Somegratitude first... and finish that drink."     The wizard smile inwardly.  That Frodo's aggresiveness had not beenpermanently harmed by all he had been through was good, but still, keeping thehobbit pliable with these elvish concoctions would still be necessary toguarantee that he continued to bankroll this quest more or less willingly, atleast until there were no magistrates around who could decide in his favour.     A knock came on the door, and then it opened.  A beautiful elven maid camein carrying a large tray of food.  The maiden set the tray before Frodo, andhanded him a second glass of the amazingly good, if salty, green drink thatGandalf had given him earlier.  "I'm Margarita. Here, El Rond and Gandalf saythis will help you to recover from your trauma.  And if there is anything elseyou need we will surely try to provide it for you."     Frodo smiled at this and thought that this was exactly what the ring wasmeant for. His thought flashed to the golden object.  "The ..."     "...Ring?" said Gandalf, showing that he knew the hobbit all too well. "It is safe around your neck, on a new chain.  But don't try using it or ElRond will make sure that something else is around your neck soon enough.  It ismuch too dangerous to use now that you have started to unwittingly tap into someof the power of the white gold."     Frodo frowned as his face turned red.  He turned his thoughts to the traythat had caused the girl to come in.  Half of it was filled with mushroomdelicacies and the other half was filled with palette cleansing side dishes tohave between the various preparations of the fungi.  He dove in, stuffinghimself as only a starved hobbit could and looked up at the wizard. "SaauummGH?"     "Sam?  Oh, yes.  Sam and the others are alright.  In fact they have allbeen enjoying your portions at the table while you've been out of it.  Once youfainted they were quite safe from your advances and had no trouble getting here.  Have another dose of your, um... medication."     Gandalf refilled Frodo's glass.  Frodo had to admit it was the bestprescription he had ever tasted.  His headache was rapidly diappearing but hewas getting a little light-headedness in return.     "Time for you to rest again.  Tomorrow, maybe, you should be able to walkabout a bit.  But for now bedrest is the thing.  Unfortunately Elvish surgicalpractices aren't what they used to be."  The wizard left Frodo with enoughcuriousity to kill ten cats.  He looked under the sheets.  He was only able tocount four scars before passing out.     Sam came in the next morning and drew the curtains wide.     "Close them!!!"  cried Frodo, as a searing pain came across his eyes.     Sam didn't listen.  "Some fresh air and light will do you good, master. Here, Gandalf said you still might be suffering from some pain beacause ofyour wound.  This stuff seems to do wonders."  Sam handed Frodo a glass of thegreen liquid.  "If you want, sir, we might be able to find some fresh fruit forthat to make it more palatable."     "Yes," replied Frodo.  "that would be good.  Next time.  It does seem tohelp the pain though."     "Indeed it does, sir.  In fact, many of the elves like to have a dose ortwo at the end of a day's work, but what work it is they do I couldn't tell you,sir.  They seem to have perfected the art of taking it easy, if you know what Imean."     Frodo saw an elven maid pass by the open door.  "I know exactly what youmean, Sam.  I'd like to learn that art from them myself."     "Do you feel up for a stroll, sir?  Everyone has been quite excited sinceyou came out of the shed that El Rond and Gandalf took you when you got here. It was a long time they spent workin' on you and there were at least twobarrels of this here green stuff that went in there.  Annie-stay-tick theycalled it but most people seem to call it margarita."     "That's what the girl who brought me my supper yesterday said her namewas," said Frodo.     "Anniestaytick?"  Sam put his knuckle in his eye, trying to make some senseof things.     "No, you ninny-hammer!  Margarita."     "Oh.....  Well, they do seem to like the stuff, so I'm not suprisedthey've named some of the younger ones after it.  That's meaning younger tothem, I mean, seeing as most of the lassies around here are at least a couplethousand years old."     Frodo had another vision af the elf from the day before and his stomachturned slightly.  He took another sip of his drink.  Yes, that's better, hethought.     After Frodo had risen and gotten dressed in the fresh clothes that hadbeen provided for him, he and Sam started out to explore the house of El Rond. Many halls it had as Bilbo had recounted over and over again when anyone gavehim the opportunity.  Halls for eating, halls for thinking, halls for readingquietly and even halls for.....  "Oh, YES," thought Frodo, "I'll have to visitthat hall," but just then he heard a scream of "Midget pig!" and Morrie andPipsqueak were flying out with the closing door barely missing them as theypassed through.     "Hi there, Frodo!" said Morrie.  Pipsqueak only grinned and he wiped hismouth with his forearm.  Morrie elbowed him in the side.     "Yes.  Hi there, Frodo.  Glad to have you back.  We were having such anawful time worrying about you."     Frodo just glared at the two and they shut up quickly, although Morriedid not like being talked to like that on any occasion.     "Why don't we take Frodo over to the Hall of the Fire," said Pipsqeak,breaking the silence.     "That sounds like a splendid idea," agreed Sam and the two were off downthe hall.  Frodo and Morrie gave a final glare at each other, smiled, andfollowed.     The hall they entered was as large as the largest hobbit banquet halls, which can be very large when you think of all the relatives and friends that hobbits feel obligated to invite because of social niceties. Bilbo's had been so large a party that it had to be moved outdoors, with the party quonset being constructed to entertain the more favoured guests while keeping away the less desirable yet obligatory invitees.  In the middle of the hall, but toward the far end from where the four had entered, was a large circular fire, free-standing with the flue just above it.  It was about twenty feet in diameter and a fire raged within it, keeping even those at the other end ofthe room warm.     An elven waitress came over to offer Frodo and his friends somemargaritas.  Each of them gratefully took one, Frodo going so far as to takea second as well.  "These headaches, y'know.  This seems to be the best thingfor them."  The others nodded while smiling knowingly each to the other two.     To the right was a bent old dwarf, who motioned for Frodo to come closer.     "It is a pleasure to meet the heir to Bilbo," said the dwarf.  "I alreadysee signs that his cunning and guile, which used to save his own skin, has beenpassed on to you.  Having made the journey you did shows that both his luckand skill were passed on to his, uh, nephew."     "Am I correct in presuming that I am talking to one of Bilbo's companionsfrom his oft told journey?"     "That you are, Mr. Baggins."  Here the dwarf bowed low as he intoned"Gloin, at your service."  Gloin held his bow for a moment, until Frododirected Sam to help unbend him.     "Ah, Bilbo," said Frodo wistfully.  "He did have a habit of going on, butstill..."     "You miss him dearly, do you not, Frodo?" asked Gloin.     "Yes, I do.  Sometimes I wonder where he is and if he still has thatchain."     Out of the corner of his eye Frodo noticed El Rond entering the hall. Rather than coming over to Frodo's group, he strode quickly to the opposite endof the hall where he greeted the most beautiful Elven woman that Frodo hadever seen, and he had been keeping his eyes open so as not to miss one since hehad awakened.  In fact, he was distracted for a moment as a waitress came up tooffer more margaritas to the party, which they all gladly accepted, Frodosaying "here, (hic) why don't I take two so you don't feel rushed to get back."     Before she turned away, Frodo grabbed the waitress's arm.  "Who is that towhom El Rond is speaking?" he asked.     "That is the Daughter of the Master of this house.  Arwen, daughter ofCelebrian who has gone to the halls of Mandos."     And so Frodo set eyes once more on the beauty which few mortals had yetseen, the vision of which had so recently given a temporary cure to his maladyand his first access to the awsome full power of the Ring: Arwen, who by theelves was called Indomitable, the Morningstar of her people, for with thatheavy piece of weaponry as well as other small handheld throwing weapons shewas as proficient as all but the greatest of the Rangers of the North.  He hadnot recognized her in her black leather regalia, which she found useful both inbattle and in other places where persuasive tactics might be enjoyed.  Indeed,as Frodo looked more closely, he could see that what he had first taken to bebaubles and jewlrey were indeed many stars and knives placed within easy reachof her hands, and El Rond, who loved her dearly, still kept a space betweenthem as they hugged in greeting so as not to be pricked by a well sharpenedblade injudiciously placed.  Her brothers, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, who had longsince stopped worrying about their sister's safety, were off hunting down tracesof those who had pursued Frodo and his companions.     Frodo thought to himself that it did not matter if she was older thandirt, she was still the best looking woman - Elf, Mortal or Hobbit - he had everseen, and if ever he got the chance...  But his reverie was broken and hisattention turned away as a voice came out of the fire.          There once was a man named Elysium          Who ran a smuggling consortium          	To the Undying Lands          	He led all his hands          In the hopes of scoring some opium.          Many a battle was fought          Over jewels some elf had wrought          	The poppies had withered          	while the elvish folk dithered          Over lessons the Valar had taught.          To them did Elysium sail          Through many a monstrous gail          	A Silmaril in hand          	He thought to demand          All the poppies Aman had for sale.          El Wing, his wife, came along          For she looked mighty good in a thong          	If the jewels held no interest          	Opinies this satirist          With his wife he couldn't go wrong.          The Valar, their interest did pique          When the light of the jewel it did leak          	Eonwe did say          	As they stood at the quay          "The Powers to you they would speak."          To the high point they both did walk          For Elysium wanted to talk          	A jewel he would sell          	for the chance for to smell          Of poppies, but the Valar did balk.          "Nay," said their spokesman, Gal-Dós          "For the fate of the world you would toss          	Away for a pittance.          	Your incompittence          Has worked out to your own loss."          At this did Elysium quake          For the jewel he thought they would take          	And he without tuppence          	Would get his come-uppence          Of a jones he ne'er could slake.          "In Middle-earth now you are done          We now send you forth with one          	Of the Silmarili          	In the sky for to fly          Until the Last Battle's begun.          "To your sons we will give this choice          For each of them you will rejoice          	To choose Man or Elf          	To live both himself          and his children, for they have no voice."          Mannish strain Earohed chose          And why?  Nobody knows.          	El Rond, he still lives          	while his brother, he gives          His flesh over to decompose.          Elysium stands on his deck          With an Silmaril hung 'round his neck          	With his wife by his side          	In the sky he does ride          keeping darkness forever in check.Now the voice was recognizable, it was Bilbo's and a smile came across Frodo'sface as the old hobbit who was being dragged around the hearth by two of ElRond's Balliffs.     "Hullo, Frodo, my lad," Bilbo said.  "I hear you had a bit of trouble getting here."  Frodo gave the tottering old hobbit an embrace and then drew up a chair for him.     They were joined by El Rond and Gandalf as well, for Frodo had missed himentering as the poetry was being recited.  "A bit cheeky of you to be writingpoems about your host's parents, do you think, Bilbo?"  said Gandalf.     Bilbo shrugged him off and continued. "Do you still have it?  The ring that is.  I must say there are many reasons to use it around here and at my age I could use all the help I can get."     Gandalf, seeing a frown coming across El Rond's face, interjected.  "Your time of posessing the ring has past, Bilbo.  It is time for others to carry theburden, but maybe not for too much longer."  He handed Frodo another drink.     "But of course.  Master El Rond, you must know that I was only jesting."     El Rond was about to reply when Frodo downed his drink in one gulp.  Helooked fine and then his eyes became wide and he started to lose his balance.     "Frodo, Can you here me?" asked Gandalf.     "Yesshh," replied the sodden hobbit.  "Boy-o-boy, when these thingsfinally hit they hit hard, don't they Gandy-poo?"     "I can help you through this Frodo my friend, but you'll have to do what Isay and it may take a while. OK?"     "I'll do anything you say, Gand-meister."     To El Rond and the others Gandalf spoke softly.  "We're halfway there. With him loaded like this we're sure to get the rest of his accounts from him."In a louder voice Gandalf spoke to the general gathering of people.  "All right,everyone, he's primed.  It's time to have our Council."  There was a mutedcheer as Morrie, Pipsqueak and Sam, carrying Frodo between them, followed afterGandalf and El Rond to the Meeting Hall.  Bilbo tottered slowly after them.
    As they entered the room, Frodo though he noticed that all presentrather felt the same as he did, what with all the deformed faces thegreeted him and all the spinning going about. Most of those presentFrodo knew already.  The others were: Giggly the dwarf, Gloin's son (hehad earned his name since he couldn't stop giggling whenever he isexcited for whatever reason). An elf clad all in flashy green was called Lego-lass.  She was a messenger from her father Thranduil, and had a slightly plastic shine to her skin and rather squarish edges to her features.  Further along, there was a man that El Rond introduced as Boromir.  He was dressed as for riding, and was sporting a helm of ancient design, simple and black, surmounted with two round protusions.  He also carried a small pocket sized silver tipped horn on his belt.  It seemed as if it had been bigger at one point, but had been cloven down to this size.  As if by a weird coincidence Boromir was the only one sporting a red shirt, all the others being dressed in yellow.  Besides that, there were many from ElRond's household and representatives of other elven lords.  And in acorner Frodo saw Arwen.    As soon as he saw her he said, "What are you doing here?  Get out of here,you have no role, and stop trying to get more for the upcoming movie!"    At this Arwen replied: "Daaaaad, can I stay please say I can, I really do want a bigger role in that movie.  I promise I'll be a nice girl and I won't touch any weapons for the next month if you let me stay."    "Out you go," said El Rond. "Frodo is right; you have nothing to do in this scene."    She went out and bashed in a stool that was in her way without thinking much about it.  After she slammed the door all heard a carnage going on outside,and El Rond knew he would have to redecorate once again.    We will not delve into the the details of what was told at this council,for if we did, it would not only be those who were present who would besleeping in it.    At the start, Gloin rambled on and on about how the dwarves wanted toregain Moira, and that the dwarves who left to find Moira probably losttheir way since they were never heard from again.  He also talked abouta horseman with a most charming voice who came by to pay them a visit atthe Lonely Mountain.  He was asking about a ring, and was so desperateof getting it back that he offered his special services for it.  Thedwarves, not looking the horse in the mouth (had they, they would'vefound him with an extremely bad breath and would've refused the offer),accepted, but never told him they didn't have the particular ring. However, the stranger not being able to differentiate between the maleand female dwarves left in utter dismay without having providedservices to anyone.    Afterwards, El Rond recounted the story of the finger cutting, whereSauron was mad at Gil-Gallamine for not faling under the seductive powerof the Ring.  "Gil-Gallamine, not liking to be given the finger, cut offSauron's finger and thus started the battle of the Gladden Fields.  Asthis was happening, Elendil, being peace loving as he was, tried toprevent Gil-Gallamine from cutting Sauron's finger, but he tripped onhis sword Narsil and broke it at the same time.  After this war therehas always been some petty unorganised squabbles going on, since Sauron had been flushed down the etheral drain.  Eventually, Gil-Gallaminedisappeared with his Ring; he never came back from a barn where a gal waswaiting for him.  He did not suspect that it was an orcish gal. When hefound out he tried running away, but he fell in the river Sirion and nevercame back up; he should've learnt how to swim.  Only myself, Othar, andCirdan know this story, for we alone saw him drown, we tried to find hisbody and the ring, but we never did."    "Wait a minute," said Frodo, "I thought your name was El Rond, not Othar.What's going on here?"    "Yes, well, both are my name.  Othar is my original name, but after theBattle of the Gladden fields, I stopped excercising and gave heed toprowesses of the mind only.  After a while, I grew soft, then flabby,and I eventually developped a Dorwinion Wine belly.  At this point, ourdear friend Gandalf started calling me round in whatever language hecould, and let me tell you he knows a lot.  The name that finally stuckto me was actully 'The Circle' in a half forgotten language calledQuébécois French.  It sounds just like eehhh L ron, but it's writttenEl Rond.  But I digress. Boromir, can you tell us what is going on inGondor?"    "I came looking for help; the armies out of Mordor are getting stronger, but it's not the number that are defeating us.  Sometimes dark riders will come with the armies.  These dark riders have been known to start tapping their feet to a rhythm, dance a weird dance and then start laughing at one of their own.  The one being laughed at is the only one who doesn't dance, and he looks rather sheepish when the others do.  When they aren't doing their dance thing, those dark riders will get everybody feeling at least somewhat romantic, and noone wants to fight anymore, except for the orcs which seem to have rather violent matingpractices.  There was also a poem that me and my brother Dr. Faramirheard in our dreams.  We talked about it to our father Denethor andhe told us to go and talk to the lore master El Rond about it.  Here'show the poem goes:	"Seek for the sword that tripped its master	One from the household of the round one will take note	Shares there they shall muster	Stronger than the nazdaq-quote	There shall be shown a token	That doom is near at hand	For Isildur's shame shall waken	And the midgets low shall stand."At these words Frodo and Bilbo felt an urge to stand up, which theydid, but they sat right back down before anyone could see them under theledge of the table.    "I now understand part of it," said Boromir, "but there is still much left unexplained.'    "You shall learn more," Aragon said weakly. "Here is the sword thattripped its master and broke in the process, and it shall be reforged. Hopefully it will bring more luck to its current master: me."    To properly present him El Rond said: "This is Aragon, son of dim-wittedArathon, head-honcho of the Rangers of the North and direct descendantof Isildur."    "Yes, and the ring belongs to me, not to you, Frodo; I'd like to have it back."    "It doesn't belong to either of you," replied Gandalf, "but just by thefact that you want the ring, it is safer for it, for Arwen, and for allwomenfolk if it remains with Frodo."    Then Gandalf stopped talking, roused most of the councilmembers and asked both Bilbo and Frodo to tell their stories as fast aspossible so that none would have time fall asleep before he got to sayhis most important part of the story.  This they did, and Frodo skippedthe whole of the Cassiopiea Took episode, not wishing to be embarassed bytoo much questioning.    When both Hobbits were done Gandalf started rambling on about how hehad entered the Necromancer's dungeons, and how he found out it wasactually Sauron and there were no undeads in the fortress.  Then hespoke of Aruman's opposition to kick Sauron out and how he finallymanaged to convince him, so with a little help from the White Council,he managed to kick Sauron out.  The he said how he found out thatBilbo's ring was the all-seducing Ring.  He was also pretty proud ofthe time he threw Bilbo's ring into melted chocolate, and when he tookit out there was written in a fine script on it Eat me to be tall(Frodo being asleep at this time of Gandalf's self-centered narative didnot hear that important piece of advice).  He also mentioned that some ofthe information he knew came from a little creature called Gulible,since he believed anything said to him.  The only frustrating part withgetting information out of Gulible was that he kept interrupting hisspeech to lament on his lost power of seduction, but aside from that hewas quite a character.  Another point which Gandalf did not understandin Gulible's speech was his constant reference to his lost precious; hesurmised it must have been his makeup or something.    After this, Gandalf recounted how he had found out that Aruman was atraitor.  He had met Radagast who told him that dark skinned horsemenwere in the Shire and Aruman knew they were somehow tied to Sauron, sohe asked Gandalf to come and compare notes on them.  So Gandalf said thathe went to talk to Aruman and willingly let himself be captured byAruman, who actually wanted to get the Ring for his own sinisterpurposes.  However, Gandalf said he had arranged for Gwaihir Lord of theEagles to rescue him and leave him in Edoras, land of the horse-lords. Once there Gandalf wanted to see the King to get the permission toborrow a horse, but the King was not there, so Gandalf started singing:	Lundi matin Gandalf, son baton et son p'tit aigle	Sont venu chez moi pour m'emprunter un ch'val	Mais comme j'étais pas là	Le petit aigle a dit	Puisque c'est comme ça nous reviendrons mardi.Most of the Rohirrim around looked at him and though him kind ofsenile, so Gandalf stopped singing and actually left with a horse andleft the King a message.  It said that Gandalf had borrowed his fastesthorse, since he was in great need of speed, and that he would returnCable Connection eventually.  After a little detour looking for Frodo,Gandalf came back to Rivendell, and that was the end of his story.    Bilbo, the only one still awake, nudged El Rond, who cleared his throatand woke the others by the same occasion.  "Yes, then." he said, "it isclear we have no choice but to destroy the Ring to get rid of Sauron."     "But why shouldn't we use the Ring ourselves?" objected Boromir. "We could seduce the orcs and get them to fight on our side!  We could getGondor to prevail!"    "Haven't you listened to anything that was said?" asked Gandalf. "Even you informed us that the orcs were fairly violent when your men feel romantic;this is simply because the standard practice among orcs is to be fairly violent and eat human flesh in their mating ritual.  There is no way any of uswould be powerful enough to prevent them from doing this."    "We thus return to the destruction of the Ring," said Nestor, chiefbutler of the household of El Rond. "Who has the strength to take theRing to the Fire which made it?"    "The eagles!" shouted Gloin. "The eagles could do it by air within a fewdays!"    As he shouted, Bilbo ducked to cover under the table, covering his headwith his hands and looking alarmingly towards the ceiling.  Seeing allthe quizzical glances turned towards him, Bilbo explained that it was ahabit he had developed near the end of his first adventure, but wouldnot give any details. In the ensuing confusion, everyone forgot aboutGloin's suggestion.    While everybody was deep in thought about who should go, Gloin repeatedhis suggestion, with the expected results, but this time Lego-lassanswered him: "I saw the eagles on my way here; they said that they wouldbe delayed because of turbulent air masses.  They also said that theyknew how urgent it was for whoever was to leave with the ring to leave,so they would try and find him in the wild to bear him with all duespeed to his goal.'  So everybody fell back in deep thoughts.     At this moment, Frodo woke up and exclaimed: "I need a deferment!!!"    "Ah, yes, I remember your insignificant friend Pipsqueak mentioning this," replied El Rond.  "I will give you your deferement in exchange for alittle service..." Then El Rond went into a complex story thatcompletely confused Frodo so he agreed to sign the paper even though itinstatly transferred all of his assets to El Rond as soon as he claimedhis new estate.  El Rond also composed another letter giving Frodo 10years to claim his estate (he wanted to be on the safe side, you neverknow with absent minded hobbits...).  But all this El Rond did on onecondition: that Frodo would bring his Ring to the fire where it had beenmade, and that he would cast it into it.  All of the conditions wereaccepted by Frodo, so he was given a few tips and pointers for hisjourney, the main one being to fear and be extremely careful around thefire, for it was in a mountain called Mount Viagra.    "But you can't let him go alone!" cried Sam, who had been eavesdroppingwhile doing a bit of gardening outside the window.    "No we can't, and you at least will go with him," said El Rond.    "A nice pickle we've landed ourselves in," said Sam. "A nice pickle, andthat's a fact."
   Later that day, after a couple of dinners, the hobbits held ameeting in Bilbo's room.  Morrie and Pipsqueak were angry when theyheard that Sam, having been eavesdropping outside the Council, hadbeen chosen as Frodo's companion.   "It's so unfair," said Pipsqueak between two seed-cakes.  "Insteadof cutting off his ears as a warning to the lower classes againstlistening in on their betters, El Rond rewards him for hispresumption!"  Morrie had explained to Pipsqueak about thefreely-growing Cannabis Sativa probably found in the South, andPipsqueak was as eager to go there as Morrie was.   "We should all go," said Bilbo.  "Winter is coming on, and spendingit under a warm sun would do my old bones quite a favour.   When the North Wind rules the land     and sleeting snows tear face like sand   when Sun is seen an hour a day     'tis best to be quite far away.Not that it is cold and drafty in El Rond's House; quite the contrary.But the out-houses are just that - out-houses, and not heated."   The Hobbits spent several weeks at Rivendell, wondering why it tookso long to decide who were to go South with Frodo and Sam, and so longto get started.  But they didn't fret.  For one thing, Frodo consentedto lending the Ring to his hobbit friends now and again, including toBilbo on one occasion.  Since hobbits are so singularly capable ofsneaking, unseen and unheard, El Rond never found out about it.  Nordid Gandalf, which would have been disastrous: wizards are wed tocelibacy in a way far more fundamental than Frodo had been untilrecently, and he would have been certain in his envy to direct ElRond's attention towards the adventurous hobbits' adventures.  Luckilythe deceptively perceptive wizard was busy in conference with El Rondmost of the time.  Occasional nightly clinking of glass and sagging,blood-shot eyes in the mornings indicated to the hobbits what the twowere sometimes conferring about.  Strider was gone, officially in thecompany of El Rond's two sons.  Where Arwen was, nobody knew.Officially.   Still, autumn was fading into winter.  The nights outside becamecrisp and cloudless, and ghoulishly cold upon the bare earth; and theybecame long.  When it was not Frodo's turn to have the Ring, he oftenstood outside watching the stars.  Particularly the constellation ofCassiopeia intrigued him, having nearly the same name as someone hehad known (or tried to know).  One of the elves told him that theconstellation was supposedly the throne of the beautiful princessCassiopeia, but the recently awakened Frodo quietly disagreed.   One day he asked Gandalf about the Ring.  "Why is it that the Ringconfers invisibility only to some who wear it?  I become invisible,Bilbo became invisible, but I noticed that Sam did not on the occasionwhen he lent it."   Gandalf shrugged.  "It's just the way of the Ring," he said.  "Somebecome invisible, some do not."  He refrained from offering hisopinion: since the Ring was a tool of seduction, it would conferinvisibility to those with faces like last week's manure with maggotsin it.  Those with plain or even beautiful faces would not need theirfeatures to be hidden from the eyes of the seductees.   "Are you coming too," asked Frodo.   "I believe I am, but I am not sure," replied the wizard.   Frodo, who was not altogether thrilled at the prospect, asked: "Whyshould you go?"   "To keep an eye on the Ring, of course, and the Bearer."  ButGandalf did not reveal the secret reasons why both he, El Rond, andAragon were so eager to see the Ring destroyed:   To Gandalf, forced to remain celibate by his profession, the Ringwould be but a penis-ring, tormenting him with its very availabilitywhile it existed, and the opportunities it offered.  El Rond suspectedwhat was happening in his House by the power of the Ring.  His wifebeing long gone, he disliked the thought of other people getting whatwas no longer available to him.  And as for Aragon, he hated andfeared the thought that it might come between himself and Arwen.   The hobbits had spent the most pleasant two months of their livesin the House of El Rond, when the scouts began to return.  Travellingundercover, they had searched diligently for the nazdaq, but neitherthey nor the G-men of Sauron had been found.  Only those who had goneWest brought tidings of trouble, from The Forsaken Inn, from Bree andfrom the Shire, where irate mobs were searching high and (most often)low for Frodo and his companions.  But since they were not headinghome, this did not trouble them much as yet.   El Rond summoned them to him.  He looked searchingly at Frodo, whoreturned an innocent look.  "The time has come," he said.  "It is hightime that the Ring leave this house.  Not just you, but the Ring also.We agreed, remember?"   "Yes," sighed Frodo.  "I will go with Sam."   "Then I must appoint your companions," said El Rond.   "How about Sam, Margarita, and young Findu-lass", thought Frodo,but he was wise enough not to think it aloud.   El Rond said: "Nine shall you be: Nine Walkers, to oppose the NineNazdaq men, who are evil.  With you, as your leader, shall Gandalfgo."  Unspoken: "...to keep an eye on you, that you don't slip out ofour agreement."  Spoken: "For the rest, I shall appoint members of theother Free Peoples: Elves, Dwerrows, and Men."   "And Women," said Arwen, who was standing a little away.  El Rondignored her routinely.   "With you shall go Lego-lass for the Elves and Giggly for theDwerrows.  Two Men shall go: Aragon and Boromir.  Boromir has foughtSauron before, and knows the procedures of his police force."Unspoken: "And I really need to get Aragon away from my daughter."  ElRond did not know how patently too late that was.   "That leaves two," said Frodo.  "I know that Morrie and Pipsqueakare willing."  Oh yes, both willing and able.   "And I am willing to send them," replied El Rond darkly.  Morriesnickered behind his face, with practiced skill.   The Sword of Elendil was reforged by Elvish smiths.  Not only didthey put the two pieces together, which requires great skill if thejoint is to be as strong as if the blade were newly-forged, but withthe improvements in metallurgy which had been make during themillennia, they shaved a pound and a half off its weight, yet leavingthe blade far stronger and less brittle than it had been before.   In Bilbo's room the old hobbit was busy giving Frodo advice.  Frodowas busy feigning attentiveness: Bilbo was now an old hobbit, and hestill had a bit of fortune.   "What about that sword of yours?" Frodo said suddenly.  "Mine brokewhen I was cutting a slice of bread with it, and since you are notcoming, you won't need yours."   "Forget it, young rascal," answered Bilbo.  "It's been with me fora long time, and it's dear to me."   "And your mail-shirt?"   "Frodo, my lad!  Why are you trying to get worldly things out ofme?  Don't you know that advice is the best that a hobbit of my agecan give to you?"  Then he continued lecturing Frodo on the merits ofstealth and burgling.   With his mouth Frodo said: "I cannot even begin to thank you for this store of wisdom that you give to me."   In reply, Bilbo sang:   I lie upon my bed and miss     the things that I have done   with every lovely lass I've kissed     and more - with every one.   I walk upon the fragrant grass     recalling seasons gone   recalling everything that was     recalling actions done.   I look into the fire and see     myself when I was strong.   Whatever will become of me     at death?  That won't be long.   I look into my room and there     are many things I stole.   But now I have a mounting fear:     a six feet, yawning hole.   Thus singing, he suddenly nodded off.  Frodo, taking some ofBilbo's advice, helped himself to what Bilbo had refused to give him,and tiptoed out of the room.   It was a cold evening in the cold end of December when the Companyset out.  Only the four hobbits were (moderately) high-spirited: theirmood had been boosted by much that had been given them, without ElRond's knowledge, although they of course regretted having to leavethose givers behind.  Boromir had another way to improve his spirits.   He raised his horn.  "Always before setting out on a journey I dothis," he said.  He put his horn to his lips.  Then, "glug glug glug."He grinned.  "You didn't seriously think that I use this horn to playmusic or battle-blasts, did you," he said as he refilled it from ElRond's farewell barrel of Margarita.  Gandalf looked at himappraisingly: wizards, too, like to have stores of liquor with them;and the store in Gandalf's huge wizard's hat was enough to float aboat, or in other words, almost his fill for one evening.   "You said that we were to be nine, Master El Rond," said Frodo."But here is Gates the ass with us, and that makes ten.  We reallyshould leave him here.  I'll go down to three silver pennies."   El Rond just looked at the animal in disgust.  To Frodo: "You donot have three silver pennies."  Actually Frodo did have more thanthat, recently acquired; but he was not going to let El Rond (or Bilbo)know this.  El Rond addressed the Company.   "The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Viagra.  Onlyon him is any charge laid: neither to cast the Ring away, nor let anyoutside the Company or myself handle it, nor sell it.  The rest of theCompany may follow him as long as chance allows or their travellingcheques last."   Now many cheerless days and weeks followed.  They made camp duringthe day, lighting no fire, hiding from spies and elil.  During thedark hours they walked as swiftly as they could, stopping only to passhraka now and again.  The icy wind made that very uncomfortable.  Theyalways buried their hraka, to leave as few traces as possible for elilto follow.  Without Gandalf's margarita, which he grudgingly doled outon rare occasions, the others would have found the journey unbearable.   Their first serious adventure after leaving Rivendell happened oneevening, when they saw a knight come thundering towards them frombehind a nearby rock.  Another followed swiftly behind; he bore aspear in his left hand, and his right one was missing.  They wereriding rather fast horses, and couching his spear, the foremost oneaimed it at Lego-lass.  "Ai, ai, Sir Breuse Sans Pité is come," shecried.  But Aragon leaped towards the approaching knight, beheadinghis horse with his sword.  Sir Breuse tumbled to the ground.  Theother knight couched his spear with some left-handed difficulty andaimed it at Aragon, but Boromir leaped forward, cutting off hisremaining hand.  "As Sir Blyaunte cut off Sir Bartelot's right hand,so I have cut off his left one," said Boromir.   Morrie, true to his character, leaped forwards and aimed a savagekick at the stunned and prostrate man's voonerables.  Immediately thetittering of the other hobbits and the pain in his toes made himrealize that, when kicking a man's voonerables, waiting until that manhas had his bloody plate armour removed is a good idea.  Especiallywhen you are a barefooted hobbit, and not a heavily-booted little manof the Night Watch.  He shot a venomous glance at Pipsqueak.  "Eathraka, Pipkin!"  Pipsqueak stopped laughing immediately, clenchinghis fists and baring his front teeth.   In the meantime, Aragon had unlaced the fallen man's helmet andbeheaded him.  And some miles behind them, a female figure looked ather fiancé with surprised appraise.  "So there is some spunk in thatclod after all," she thought to herself.   "Who was that man?" asked Pipsqueak.   "That was Sir Breuse Sans Pité," replied Boromir.  "The worstcoward and murderer who ever put a 'Sir' before his name.  Heespecially enjoyed killing ladies.  Aragon must have avenged a wholeschoolful of them with that stroke."   "What does 'Breuse Sans Pité' mean?"   "It means 'the pitiless bruce'," said Frodo, "unless my Australianis off the mark."   As the Company settled under their blankets after that night'smarch, Morrie heard Sam singing, a single line:   ...for he knew his toes could feel it...   An almost inaudible snickering told him that Frodo and Pipsqueakhad also heard that.   Some days later they saw the Misty Mountains marching almoststraight across their path.  Nearly due south three mountains aroseabove the main ridge.  Giggly began to smile warmly.   "There they stand, the three mountains of Moira," he giggled.  "Oh,Khazad-Mum, the Dwerrow-wench, who is called the Golden Pit.  Aboveher house stand the three peaks erect: Barazinbar the Hardhorn,Zirak-Zigil the Silverthrust, and Bundushathûr the Risinghead.  Longhas she been absent from her house, we know not where though we knowwhy."   "Why?" asked Pipsqueak.   "She was the undying wife of the Dwerrowen kingdom under the threemountains," replied Giggly.  "But then, many lives of ordinaryDwerrows ago, a terrible menace was awoken as the Dwerrows weredigging in the mines beneath the house.  The people were scattered,and Moira lost."   "The wife of the Dwerrowen kingdom?" whispered Sam to Frodo.   "Yes, the Dwerrows do tell strange tales concerning their lives andfates in this world," replied Frodo.  "It is nothing compared to thereligious practices of certain pagan peoples of Men."   "It is for the Dim Rill dale between the three mountains that weare making," said Gandalf.  "There is a great ski resort there, on thewest side, where we may rest, and rent skis for the journey across thepass of the Hardhorn Gate."   "For whose money?" muttered Frodo.  "I have none left - that theothers know about, at least.  But many have IOU's with my names onthem, both Underhill and Baggins."   The Company started climbing the pass.  But soon they noticed thatsomething was wrong.  In the far distance they could see the hotel,and ski lifts leading upslope from it.  There should have been smokecoming out of the chimneys, and the ski lifts should have been teemingwith activity, as should the snowy slopes.  But all was still.Huffing and puffing with the exertion (especially Gandalf, the heavysmoker), they reached the front door of the hotel.  There was a signon it:  Temporarily closed by the health authorities.  The sign waswritten both in Westron and in the Black Speech of Mordor, and so theycould guess what the real cause and motive were.  Steel bars behindthe windows prevented them from burgling their way in.  Only Frodobreathed a sigh of relief, as they plodded on.   Snow began to fall, and so did the temperature.  This, however, didnot bother the Company much, except when they had to bare theirbacksides to pass hraka in some nook among the cliffs, wiping withsnow that was happily newly-fallen and soft, not composed of hardsharp grains.  Nor were they troubled much by the rising wind, whichmade the snow swirl.  El Rond had provided them with amply warmclothes, made of double reindeer skins with the inner layer having thehairs inwards: a trick learned from the Lossoth.  Even the hobbits hadput on soft boots of that make, except Morrie, who wore steel-cappedboots like Strider.  Worst was the loss of visibility, but both Aragonand Gandalf had been that way before, and did not need to see theirroad much ahead to follow it.  But other perils did the cruel passhave in store for them.   The wind wailed among the stones.  Rocks came crashing down fromthe unseen heights above.  Gates the ass shivered and gibbered, andonly with threats and continual booting did they get the animal tomove forward.  "This is a weather for penguins, not asses," mutteredSam.   Eerie noises began wailing, shrieking and laughing maniacally.Exclamation marks came in fives from the darkness around them.  Thehobbits grew uneasy.  "Is it the stallo we hear?" asked Pipsqueak."Or a sort of draug of the mountain?"  But he was not answered.   Suddenly a gigantic dark figure loomed in the path just beforethem.  They stopped dead, and two other figures appeared beside thefirst one.  The dark figures strode forwards, appearing to shrink insize but becoming sharper as they came closer, until before them stoodthree customs officials with leering grins.  "I feared this,"whispered Gandalf.  "These roving bands of customs officials andimmigration authorities often haunt this pass.  It is difficult topass them by."  Unless you leave them all your liquor and tobacco,and don't belong to some minority.  But who will lose his liquor andtobacco to these creatures?  Certainly not I.   "So," sneered the foremost figure.  "Anything to declare?"   At once the Company began shouting abuse at the obnoxious men inuniforms.   "Abusing government officials, eh?"   Suddenly Aragon, Boromir and Gandalf leaped forward, Giggly andLego-lass following.  There was a short, sharp affray, and soon thecustoms officials lay bound and gagged beside the path.  Morrie, withhis inherited and ferocious animosity towards such creatures, hopedthat their thick greatcoats would not keep them from freezing to deathin the blizzard.  He made sure to kick them in the voonerables, hardand cruelly, this time with boots on, and his victims without platearmour.  Sam was little less hateful towards them, representatives ofan oppressive bourgeois State as he perceived them to be.  The samewent for Frodo: he saw them as representatives of Communist oppressionand control of free citizens.  The Company helped themselves from thepockets of the customs officials, and moved on.  But the respite wasshort.  Other such bands lay in wait further up.   "Anything to declare?"   Sock bam bonk   Rummage   Plod plod plod   "Anything to declare?"   Sock slam grind ouch   Rummage   Plod plod   "What's in your packs then?"   Bonk bang oof ding you big oaf   Soon it became obvious that they could not continue that way.There were too many such bands, and they increased in size as theCompany ascended towards the crown of the pass that marked the borderbetween Eregion and Wilderland.  Soon, if they continued, they wouldbe overcome, thrown in the slammer, and have all their contrabandseized.  The last few bands of customs officials had looked with scornand contempt at the hobbits: "Well what have we here?  Minorities?Look rather minor to me."  Sock sock aargh boink bang sod youchtong - rummage   They stopped beneath a half-shelf that offered some shelter fromprying eyes.  There they spent the remainder of the night, cold butnot altogether cheerless.  At least this good had come of theirencounters with the roving bands of customs officials: they had someloot to examine and divide.  It wasn't much.  The wandering tribes ofcustoms officials of the Misty Mountains, while seizing anything inthe possession of anything with a pulse, a flask and a purse, wereequally wont to spending it again swiftly.   It was Morrie who discovered the most valuable treasure.  As he,his back towards the rest of the Company, was rummaging through someof the take, he found a little plastic bag with some dust in it.Great was his pleasure when he discovered it to be a teaspoonful ofVala dust, a very powerful narcotic.  Great was his chagrin when, ashe was gloating over his prize, Pipsqueak, peering over his shoulder,gleefully announced his find to the others in that loud, high-pitchedvoice of his.  Morrie was forced to share.  It was something which hehad never understood the point in - when it was his belongings beingshared.   Gandalf forbade the Company to use any of the precious dope at thattime and place.  "We are high enough up as it is," he said.   "I wasn't going to use it myself," Morrie sulked.  "Some of usknow how dangerous that stuff is."   Morning came, revealing black specks further up the path.  Aragon,experienced smuggler as he was, knew them for more customs officials."We cannot go that way," he said.  But turning back down, the Companyencountered the largest and fiercest band of customs officials thatthey had yet met.  Standing a furlong down the path, they grinnedexpectantly as the Company approached.  Their leader strode forwards.In his hands were visa waivers, green and menacing, slips of stiffpaper almost like cardboard.  "Halt," he said.  "You must first fillin these, if you want to pass."   They took the visa waivers, and wearily they started filling themout, none too truthfully.  The leader of the customs officials watchedthem writing, closely.  Then he collected the waivers and examinedthem.   "Hold!" he shouted.  "These are filled out in the wrong colours!It has to be with yellow ink, signatures in red!  You have written thewhole lot in black or blue.  At it again!"   Boromir looked at Aragon.  Aragon looked at Boromir.   Crash bang ouch splotch bang slam crack   Pant pant   Grind kick hate snarl biff sock pant bite sock   Pant   Rummage   Finally the road was clear.  Green visa waivers, many of them tornto confetti, lay scattered upon the path or fluttered in the lightwind that came down from the pass.   The Company began descending the path again.  The customs officialsof Charadhras had defeated them.  This time.   A slender figure slid quietly into hiding between two boulders,watching them pass by.  In her pockets were a few items which theCompany had missed in the dark when rummaging through the belongingsof the customs officials further down.
   It was evening, or close to it, and the sun was nearing thetreetops, when they all trudged to a halt as if by some prearrangedsignal in a small thicket of old and twisted holly.  Gandalf sparedthem one mere mouthful each of the margarita of Rivendell.  The delayin the mountains had forced them to ration out their food, much to thedismay of the hobbits.  When they had eaten their all too meagerdinner, Gandalf called the fellowship to gather round.   "We cannot go further today," he said, "for we still have a greatdeal of loot to sort and divide while it is still light.Nevertheless, we must proceed with clear purpose if we do not wish tobe turned back from our quest once again.  What road shall we takenext?"   Boromir spoke first.  "We already know that I alone did notattract the hostile eyes of Sauron or Aruman when I travelled here.Why can we not split into a few small companies and so enter the landof Edoras unremarked?  We could meet at the Gap in Rohan: thehorse-lords are my friends and are in charge of security there.  Oncewe are reunited in inhabited lands, our small party will hardlyattract notice."   "Of course, Boromir," said Lego-lass, her long ears twitchingin excitement, "it would be even less of a risk for you to ride to theGap yourself and seek aid from your friends there.  The rest of uscould travel south, crossing the Jordan into Lebanon.  You should beable to arrange to meet us there with some spare horses from Edoraswithout attracting any real attention, and we can ride swiftly throughsouthern Gondor and reach our goal in a matter of weeks."   The company quickly agreed that this plan was best, and hurried toclaim their shares of the spoils of Charadhras.  Despite their haste,the squabbles lasted far into the evening, and tempers began to runshort.  "Oh, enough already!" cried Frodo.  "We can finish this in themorning; I need to sleep.  Those branches creaking in the wind arestarting to drive me batty."  At these words all fell into silentplots.   Suddenly, Aragon gasped in fear.  "Branches creaking!  Nay!  Thoseare squeaks, all around us.  The Reeps have come west of themountains!"   "Quickly, then, follow me," whispered Gandalf.  "We will form acircle atop this conveniently placed hill.  If we can manage to remainsilent, we may yet evade their hunt."  The company stealthily made itsway to the easliy defensible crown of the hill, and waitedbreathlessly for the deadly Reeps to pass them by.   "I wish I'd stayed home," said Pipsqueak to Sam, quite a bit tooloudly.  "Theese squeaks freeze my blood.  I feel wretched."  As theentire company fixed Pipsqueak in a hateful glare, the nearby squeaksbecame louder and more excited as the hunting troop homed in on hisvoice.  Suddenly, silence fell.   Barely visible in the darkness, a creature stepped forward.  Itstood well over a foot high, and its ears were nearly as long as arabbit's, though wider: the creature resembled nothing so much as awalking rat.  Through the darkness, they could discern at its side atiny little rapier, and as the creature gazed back at them it strokedits long, moustache-like whiskers.  Other grey forms began to appeararound them in the darkness, several dozen at least, and they stoodlike their leader just at the edge of the company's vision.   The rat-thing drew its sword in one fluid motion and raised it inthe air.  It hung there for a minute, and then two, and then suddenlyswept down in a flash.  At that signal, a high, piercing trumpet callsounded, and with a cry from a hundred tiny throats the beasts chargedin with their sharp swords flashing before them.   The battle was swift and vicious: the well-armed rodents danced inand out among the feet of the fellowship, jabbing with their swords.Once his initial fear wore off, however, Giggly began to snicker, andsoon all of the companions were laughing, for despite their greatnumbers the Reeps simply could not make up for their diminutive size.Aragon and Boromir's boots dealt death to any that came in range,while Gandalf pounded at them with his staff.  Giggly's axe swept fromside to side like a scythe through grass, and Lego-lass abandoned herknife for the greater entertainment to be had in swinging her bowthrough the horde in broad, bumpy, and very satisfying strokes.  Thehobbits were pressed harder, but even their small size gave them aninsurmountable advantage over their diminutive adversaries, and therapiers of the little beasts were useless against the longer bladesand greater strength of the defenders.  Soon, every last Reep had beenslain or beaten senseless.   The only serious casualty of the attack was Sam: he found himselffaced by the leader of their attackers, and was unlucky enough to losehis grip on his sword long enough to be disarmed.  Naturally heremained unworried: when the Reep charged in, Sam caught hold of itslong tail and began to swing the thing around in circles.  At firstthis went beautifully: the Reep gave a loud "cheep!" as it was caughtand lifted, and Sam managed to use it as a flail to knock several ofits followers senseless.  However, it managed to twist round and giveSam several deep jabs in the hand and arm, and he let the thing gowith a cry in mid-swing.  The beast flew head first into a nearby treetrunk and did not rise again, but Sam had received some nasty cuts andstumbled to bed as soon as the battle was over.   Once their attackers had been for the most part stilled, Gandalffound a dry branch, lit it on fire with his tinderbox, and strodetoward the knot of trees atop the hill.  High in the air he flung thetorch, and as it rose its flame blazed while Gandalf's voice rolledlike thunder:   "Naur basto i narhoth!" he cried.   There was a roar and a crackle as the torch landed in the brush,and the dry trees began to burn hot and bright.  Gandalf turned to thecompany, smiled, and began to roast Reeps at the fire, using theirtiny rapiers as skewers.  The rest of the company gladly joined inthis welcome second (and much larger) supper, and they spent theremainder of the night in good cheer.   Once the sun was well above the horizon, the company began to stiragain.  Even Sam was up and active: a good night's rest was all he hadneeded to recover from his wounds.  He appeared confused, however: helooked in vain for traces of the dead Reeps, but not a hint of thefight remained.  All he could see was a cluster of charred stumps anda neat pile of little rapiers, all intact.  "What happened to all thebodies?" Sam asked with a note of concern in his voice.  "There wereso many of them..."   "Vanished without a trace!" said Pipsqueak.  "They were magicrats."  Sam's eyes grew wide, but then he shrugged, and the companysoon broke camp and followed Gandalf to the south.   For hours on end they wandered and scrambled in a barren country ofworn stones, but for all their effort they could not seem to breakfree from the mountains.  As the day went on, the companions began togrumble about the lack of progress, when suddenly the fellowshiprounded a standing stone to find itself in a small pocket valleyholding a beautiful emerald lake.   "I know this place," cried Giggly, wearing a foolish grin.  "It isthe back-doorstep of our beloved Moira herself; the rear gate of herhouse cannot be far from here.  Gandalf, is this on the way toLebanon?"   The wizard coughed, and looked up at the sun with confusion andannoyance.  "Yes, of course.  That is, I meant to bring us here: theEnemy is sure to expect us to take the easiest route.  To avoid hisgrasp, we must do just the opposite.  Come, we must find the door."   The hobbits stood rooted to the ground in terror: the undergroundhouse of Moira was a shadow of fear from their distant past, a darkname in the ancient legends of their people.  They soon recovered,however, as they were becoming increasingly aware of the fact thatvirtually every place they had ever heard of outside the Shire was adistant shadow in hobbit legend in some way or other.  While none ofthe company were happy about Gandalf's change in plan, they realizedthat they had to follow where he led: he was carrying all of El Rond'smaps.  With heavy hearts, they descended into the valley.   They followed their guide along the thin path between the lake andthe cliff face, huddling away from the water for fear of they knew notwhat.  As they walked, their dread increased, until every melodiousbirdcall made them jump in fear.  The continued around the pool, untilthe path ended against a blank and dirty wall of stone.  "Where shallwe go now, Master Gandalf, sir?" asked Sam with a blend of irony andconcern.   "The Dwarves were never known for their good housekeeping," repliedGandalf, "and not even they have passed this way in a great manyyears.  Dwarf-doors are made to collect a great deal of grime whenshut, but unless things are completely changed, those who know whereto look may discover the signs."  With that, the wizard walked forwardto the wall and began to scrub at it with the hem of his robe.  Soon,the outline of a door took shape through the accumulated dirt ofcenturies.
   Giggly giggled with delight as the gateway to the ancient home ofhis people became visible.  "Look!" he exclamed as Gandalf scrubbednear the bottom of the door, "The Star of the House of Durin!"   "Let us hope that my Arwen never gets any ideas from that!" saidAragon.  "Hmm.  It reads, Welcome to the Akblay Itpay.  The key isunder the mat.  Giggly, what does Akblay Itpay mean?"   "It is an ancient Elvish term, meaning 'Sparkling Lamps'.  TheElves who crafted these signs loved our lanterns dearly when theyvisited Moira's halls.  It was one of Balin's hopes in returning hereto rediscover the secret of those lamps: the Lonely Mountain couldreally use a good product to export, and it would be a great boon totourism as well."  As Giggly spoke, Lego-lass stifled a laugh, andAragon and Boromir fought valiantly not to grin.  Gandalf, who hadjust given up scrubbing away grime at the edges of the door, pretendednot to notice and instead stared at the tiny keyhole that he haduncovered on its right hand side.   The hobbits were not paying attention: Frodo and Sam were staringat the lake, watching for the slightest ripple, while Pipsqueakscanned the sky for unknown dangers.  "Gandalf," queried Morrie withnervous urgency, "what does it mean, The key is under the mat?"   "It seems to be some sort of riddle, which we must solve if we hopeto pass through Moira's halls," the wizard replied.  "But its answeris lost in the mists of time, and I must now search my memory to findits secret.  While I think, the rest of you must prepare for thejourney: we must now abandon our ass and share his burdens as best wecan."   "But we can't abandon poor Gates!" whined Sam.  "I've become fondof him despite his problems, and that's a fact.  Anyway, he's almostone of us: he's practically as smart as Pipsqueak already, and hewould have been smarter if Pip had stayed drinking those margaritasfor another couple of weeks.  We can't just leave him to die in theWild!"   Gandalf turned from the door to avert the crisis.  He walked up toGates, laid his hands on his head, and began to chant in a low voice:"Go now with our blessing upon you, to avoid wolves and bears, cliffsand crevices, and all the myriad dangers that await your kind in thewild.  May you find your way in time to safety, wherever that may be,and may your life be long and fruitful."  When he had finished,Gandalf raised his head.  "There, Sam.  Now that he is protected by myspell, he's sure to live a long and happy life.  He'll probably findhis way to live on a vet's farm outside of some town, and rest therehappily into fat old age."   "Thanks," said Sam trustingly.  "I'll miss ol' Gates, but it's arelief to know that he'll be okay."  He and the others then began torearrange their packs, adding what they could of the donkey's burdento their own loads.  They worked hastily, for the nervousness thatgripped the hobbits had spread to the whole company: evening wascoming on, and the hoots of distant owls began to chill their blood asthey worked.   Gandalf, meanwhile, turned back to the door, and soon beganspouting all manner of incantations.  As one after another failed toopen the path into the Dwerrow-realm, he became increasinglydesperate, until he simply began pounding his staff against the rockand yelling "Open, damn you!" in every language he knew.  Finally, hethrew himself to the ground in dispair and began to dig his hands intothe ancient doormat in consternation.   "Ugh!" groaned Boromir.  "Some dreadful thing is approachingus, I can feel it.  How I hate this foul pool!"  He picked up a largerock near the edge of the lake and hurled it far out into the water.   The stone vanished with a loud splash, and great rippling ringsformed where it had fallen and began to approach the foot of thecliff.  Frodo and Sam screamed in terror as the waves drew swiftlynearer, and the whole company dashed away from the water, over toGandalf at the door.  Just at that moment, Gandalf cried "Aha!" as hisgroping right hand found the hidden key.  He leapt to his feet,unlocked the door, and quick as lightening they all piled inside.  Asthe ripples reached the shore, Gandalf shoved the key back under themat, and Sam had just enough time to shout "Run, Gates!" beforeGandalf yanked the door closed behind them.  It swung to with a loud"click", and moments later they heard something hit the outer wallwith a thump.  The company fled into the darkness.   When they finally stopped, exhausted from their terror and theirflight, Gandalf said, "Well, the passage is locked behind us now, andthere is only one way out: the far side.  I fear from the sounds thatsome horrible snake creature has emerged from the lake and is even nowpiling boulders against the door to prevent all escape: certain deathsurely awaits any who visit this valley now."  In the dim light of hiswand, Gandalf noticed Sam's pained expression, and added, "Don'tworry, Sam: with my spell of protection on him, Gates surely escapedunharmed."   The fellowship marched on through the Dwarven tunnels, but soon itbecame apparent that they would need to stop somewhere for the night.Before long, they reached a three way fork in the corridor, and off tothe side was a small abandoned guardroom.  It was empty, save for thecrumbling fragments of a stone well-lid long since broken.  The emptymouth of the well loomed wide at the center of the room, and as theysettled down for the night, they all stayed as far from it aspossible.   All, that is, save Pipsqueak.  Driven by curiosity, he picked up afair-sized rock and dropped it into the depths.  After a few longheartbeats of silence, a distant flop echoed up the shaft.  Gandalfand the others leapt up in fear, and were little comforted whenPipsqueak admitted what he had done.  Gandalf stood tall and menacingover the diminutive hobbit, and he growled, "Fool of a Took!  Youcould have brought any number of horrors upon us from the depths withthat stone.  This is a serious, dangerous journey, and if you aren'tmore careful, you'll get us all killed."   He took a breath to go on, but suddenly Pipsqueak gave a cry andtumbled into the depths of the well.  As his long scream faded intothe distance, Morrie straightened his jacket and stared down afterhim, until a distant splat marked the end of Pipsqueak's yell.   The fellowship stared at Morrie in horror.  "He was a liability,"explained the Mobster without the slightest hint of emotion.  "Theweak link had to go.  Now, get some sleep and we'll be on our way inthe morning."  Not daring to disagree, the others all quicklyretreated to their bedding, but for several hours only Morrie and Samwere able to overcome their shock and sleep.   As the fellowship slept deep within the halls of Moira, a shapelyform made its way through the night around the edge of the lake.  Asshe approached the door, she realized that a beast was in her way: alarge but sad looking donkey was standing there staring at the closedportal, and from the marks it looked as if the poor animal hadrepeatedly thrown itself against the wall in at attempt to get in.Arwen's efforts to lead it away from the door were entirelyunsuccessful, and after several attempts, she leaned down to the assand said in a fierce whisper, "You're far too big for me push around,so get out of my way or I'll slice you in two."  At that, Gates flednorth around the lake, and disappeared into the night.   With the donkey gone, Arwen was able to make out the writing on thedoor by starlight, and she quickly reached down and found the key.She unlocked the door, only to find someone waiting for her on theother side: standing before her was a short, geriatric fellow with bigeyes and a complexion as light as a computer science grad student."Damn!" the ancient hobbit said, "Greatest opportunity of my life, andI haven't a chance in the world of making you mine, my precious.  Nomore than I would have been able to seduce that square-chinned elvenlass in the guardroom.  Ah well... I'll be on my way.  Thanks foropening that door, missy."   Arwen's mind leapt to a conclusion, and she acted at once.  "Oh, Iwouldn't be so sure," she said, stroking Gulible's arm.  "I've alwayswanted to spend some time with an older man.  I've got a headacheright now, but maybe if you showed me to that guardroom you mentionedI'd be more in the mood.  Sound good to you?"  Gulible's delighted, iflecherous, smile was answer enough, and as soon as Arwen had replacedthe key under the mat the two of them crept stealthily into thedarkness.   All too soon, the fellowship awoke and walked back out to thepassage.  Gandalf stared at the two roads for some time, and consultedwith Giggly about the route, but eventually he said, "I do not likethe smell of the middle way, and I do not like the taste of theleft-hand way: there have been foul feet down there, or I am noguide."  Frodo was quietly sick, while Gandalf went on.  "I shall takethe right hand passage.  It is time we began to climb up near thesurface: with luck, we will find a window that can give us a hint asto where the eastern gate lies."  He started down the passage, and theothers followed, passing one by one under a glowing "EXIT" sign asthey went.   They walked for miles, on and on into the heart of the mountain.Occasionally, Frodo thought that he heard footsteps in the distancebehind them that were not echoes and the occasional clink of metal,but as he could see nothing following he did not alert the others.After a long march, they finally reached a large hall, with many doorsand passageways leading off from it.  Before they had the chance toworry about their route, however, Lego-lass gave a glad cry, for shesaw sunlight filtering into the darkness from a small room off to theside.  Just as the company started to run toward it, however, theyheard a noise coming from that room: taptaptap. tom, tom, tom. taptaptap.  They stopped where they stood, and after a littlewhile the knocking repeated itself.   The company was quite hesitant to approach the odd noise, but tooexcited by the sunlight to flee far, so they simply settled down inthe great hall for a meal.  As they ate, Lego-lass gazed happily atthe sunlight, and said "You know, once some daylight creeps in here,it's not nearly so bad.  What kind of animals could live in this dark,dreary place on lamplight alone?"   At this, Giggly flashed Lego-lass a dark look.  "We were perfectlyhappy living here with shining lamps and not a single window," hesaid, "until you price-fixing monopolist Elves raised the price of oilso terribly high and we were forced to improvise.  Yes indeed, thingswere better for Dwarves back then."  He began a singsong chant:     The world was young, the mountains tall,     No blemish touched the moon at all,     No deeds gave rights to stream or tree     When Durin woke alone and free.     He claimed the unclaimed hills and dells;     He said he owned untasted wells;     He stopped and gazed on Prismstone,     And saw a star appear alone,     Compared to it, all jewels were dim,     That stone, he said, belonged to him.     The world was fair, the mountains black,     The kids those days did not talk back,     The weather then was nice and mild,     Good fruit and grain grew in the wild.     The laws were good, the Cubs could play:     The world was fair in Durin's Day.     The king he was of all there is     And everything, he said, was his     From gold and gems beneath the earth     To every child upon its birth.     On light of sun and star and moon     All paid a tax, lest they be hewn.     'Cause he was first, he got to say     How lesser beings spent their day.     They hammer on the anvil smote,     They chiseled, 'graved, and tended goat,     They hunted game, they cut down trees,     And for the privelege they paid fees.     Each ruby dug, each pearl found     With all these was great Durin crowned.     Police and army did his will,     And dissidents did Durin kill.     Unwearied then were Durin's folk,     For they of work did not a stroke,     but profited from Durin's claim     to own each thing that had a name.     The world is grey, the mountains cold;     Though Durin's claims on paper hold,     The Elves go West, the Men grow rich,     But Durin's folk are forced to stitch,     And dig, and build, and spend our gold;     No rest is there for young or old.     But though our history be unknown,     We gaze upon the Prismstone;     There lies our star in crystal deep,     No matter who its deed does keep.   When Giggly finished, Boromir was quite appreciative.  "Bravo!"he cried.  "We know many classic tales about the Dwarfs in Gondor.A happy people oft-mentioned in our legends, ever cheerful and proneto great labours and song."   "We... dwarfs... have heard about your so-called 'legends',"Giggly replied, quietly and with unusual venom, "and I've got to tellyou: they make me want to retch."   At last, the company finished their luncheon, and they steeledthemselves to face the strange noise, which they continued to hearoccasionally as they approached: taptaptap. tom, tom, tom. taptaptap.The light grew brighter, and they passed through the stone door into a large square chamber.  The floor was littered with a great many brightly colored objects, but their eyes had not yet adjusted to the sunlight and they could not at first make out their shapes.  The light from the window fell directly onto a large table in the center of the room: a single rectangular block about two feethigh, upon which was laid a great, irregular slab of grey stone.   "It looks like a tomb," said Frodo, as he struggled to decipher themarkings before him.  On the slab, crude runes were deeply gouged.   "These are Dwarvish runes, but in the debased mode of Mordor," saidGandalf.  "Here is written, in the tongues of Dwarves and Orcs,             BALIN SON OF FUNYUN               'LORD' OF MOIRA   "He is dead, then," said Frodo.  "I feared it was so."  Gigglybowed his head and covered his face.  As if the very stones sharedtheir grief and dispair, a final, faint noise welled up from beneaththe slab: tap tap tap. tom. tom. tom. tap tap tap.   Deep beneath the mountain, Pipsqueak trudged up and up, leaving atrail of dripping ooze behind him.  Although he knew that the enormousbloom of algae and cave kelp beneath the shaft had broken his fall andundoubtedly saved his life, he still wished that he could have landedin something that didn't smell so loathsome.  As it was, he was simplydoing his best to follow the occasional "EXIT" signs in the hallswhile not stumbling into another well.   Suddenly, as he turned a corner, Pipsqueak came face to face with apatrol of goblins.  In despair at his horrid luck, he gave a low moanand stumbled toward them.  Had he not been covered in slime from asubterranean fen, things may have gone quite badly for Pipsqueak, butfaced with a foul-smelling beast from the uncharted depths of themines the goblins screamed and fled back the way they had come.Pipsqueak knew that he only had a few minutes before they returnedwith reinforcements, so he took off running toward a distant "EXIT"sign to get what little lead on the pursuit he could.
   The Company of the Ring stood silently beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo recalled the Dwarf's visit to Uncle Bilbo long years ago.  In thedusty chamber, it seemed a thousand years ago and yet all too near.   "You," started Frodo nonchalantly, "You don't suppose...."   tap tap tap went the tomb.   "Oh, I seriously doubt it," Gandalf chuckled nervously, "Heh....thatis..."   Tap tippity tip tap.   TAP.   The company looked about them anxiously and Giggly spied a wornleathern tome half-hidden in a nook.  "Gandalf, here!"  the Dwarf cried."See what I've found!"   "Ah, excellent, Giggly!"   Gandalf rushed to the Dwarf's side, onlytoo happy to put unpleasant surmises out of mind. "This-is-what-a-wizard--is-for-now-let-me-see.. Ha, ha....."   "But, Gandalf,"  said Aragon, "what about this tomb?"   Tappity tappity tap?  added the cold stone.   "Hmm, yes, very interesting indeed, my good Giggly!  Seems to be somesort of log book.  Let's see what it says here...it's some kind of runicwriting.   Good thing I'm here, eh, Giggly?  Good at runes, are wizards,eh?"   "Gandalf!"  Lego-lass threw a small stone at the wizard's back.  TheCompany (minus wizard and Dwarf) were becoming quite annoyed.   "Well, seems the roof isn't quite as stable as I thought,"  saidGandalf brushing the pebble-dust from his shoulder. "Ah, yes, here weare, Giggly.  These are the records of the Taking of Moira."   "Think we ought to pry up the stone?"  asked Boromir.   "I dunno," said Aragon.   "What's to lose?"  put in Lego-lass.   "Our lives,"  added Morrie.  Lego-lass sighed and the others milledabout in indecision.   Tap tip tip tap.   "Yes, here we are.  I can just make out these runes here:   "We drove out many goblins from the gate - then something something,We have taken Moira for ourselves.  Great wealth was found yesterday aswe plundered her treasures.  Balin is the Master of Moira - the next fewpages seem just to be more innuendo..... AH, here's the last bit - No moretoys!  We have toiled long enough for our Elven masters!  Though theyhave used goblins against us, their plans are revealed at last!  We haveended our slavery in the Yule toy mines.  Revolution!  Balin has ledus.  Long live the fighters! - more patriotic twaddle here - Balin hasfallen.  We are being routed and already the dreaded Master's Drums areheard.  Drums, Drums, drums in the deep.  Redundancy withinredundancy....He is coming..."   "A dark end," sighed Giggly.   "So it would seem,"  said Gandalf. "But my mind misgives.  WhatMaster does the scribe refer to?  Elvish sweat-shops and a hiddenMaster of Moira.  Very deep waters indeed, my good Dwarf."   Tap tippity tap.  Oh, will they never hear?   "I fear we must leave at once," announced the wizard to the Companystill staring at the tapping tomb of Balin.  "I feel that we are ingrave danger!"   "Yes, speaking of graves,  Master Wizard - " started Boromir.   "We've no time!  Follow me, all of you!"  With that the wizard dashedout of the hall.  The others reluctantly filed out after him.  Morrietailed the company and he faintly heard a muffled voice callingdesperately from the tomb as he left the hall.  Serves him right!  theMobster thought to himself.   They entered a vast and magnificent hallway.  On either side of thehall were incredibly detailed columns carved in the forms of trees thatgrew upon the mountainside above them.  Others had representations ofElves in festive garb and young children with seasonal treats in theirhands.  In the hundreds, the magnificent posts lined the hallway.  Thecompany looked about themselves in awe.  Giggly tittered in delight atthe work of his fore-fathers.   "I know now where we are," said Gandalf, "this is the Hall ofMarzipan.  We are now very close to the exit we seek.  Across the halland up the long stair and out!"   He had hardly uttered these words when there was a great noise:  arolling Boom that seemed to come from the direction they had justfled. They sprang to the door and wedged it shut.  They heard a noise ofmany feet and many fell cries coming towards them.   Pipsqueak was exhausted.  He had climbed the ladder to what seemed atrap-door to a chamber above him.  Indeed it was such, but his smallarms could not reach far enough to push upon it. He heard the voices ofhis companions on the other side, but dared not cry out lest he becaught by the patrolling Goblins.    In the end he had climbed back down the ladder to fetch  the skeletalarm of a Dwarf corpse that had tumbled down that ladder.  With many an"Ewww!" he managed to free the bones from the desiccated figure andclimb back up the steps.  He tapped as loudly as he dared for whatseemed eons to his straining muscles.  He tried every 'jail code' Morriehad taught him after the Mobster's first stint in the joint, but to noanswer.   Finally, Pipsqueak climbed back down the tall ladder in dismay andfatigue.  As he reached the bottom, he heard the staccato tattoo of awar drum and the sound of many goblin voices.  Desperately, he lookedabout him for an exit, but found only dark corners littered withcorpses.  He made for one of these and dived on top of one and hoped tobe mistaken for a dead dwarf.   The room filled with marching goblins all making for the ladder. They charged up the steps with evil cries and forced the trap-door openwith a resounding Boom and poured through high above the quakinghobbit.  Last to ascend were two small drummer goblins and on theirheels, huge stone Trolls snickering and driving them on with foul words.    They had not seen Pipsqueak.  After the last of them had gone throughthe trap-door, Pip cautiously made his way up the ladder.   "They are coming!"  shouted Lego-lass. Pah-rum pah, pum-pum camethe drums.   The others started for the exit knowing they could never make such along run ahead of their pursuers.   In the middle of the hall, Gandalfturned and struck the floor behind them with his staff.  A great fissureopened and with words of incantation (and a healthy dose of spirits fromhis hat-flask), the wizard created a great inferno within the crack hehad opened.     As the flames took hold, the first of the goblins poured through thedoor.  He made straight for Frodo holding aloft a great stick.  Hehurled it with great might and it struck Frodo square in the chest. Lego-lass gasped and went to him.  Aragon waited until the Goblin wasjust within reach and swept its head from its shoulders with one mightyswing of his sword.  Boromir had also cut down many Goblins as theycame near the fissure, but they all retreated as the flames finally cameto full life and sprang up in a deadly dance.   "Just through here, you say?"  asked Arwen, panting audibly.   "Yesssssss, precious," replied Gulible, "the guard room you lookssfor."   "We've been at this for hours!"   "Now we wants our reward, naughty little Elf Girl,"  Gulibleslavered in expectation of nubile, immortal flesh at his lips.   "Very well, then, Gulible,"  Arwen stood and unzipped her jerkin. Gulible held his breath.  "I have your reward here for you."  Shereached into the bosom of her jerkin and struck Gulible right in hisvoonerables with one swift cick from her steel-toed stiletto hikingboots.  Swiftly stooping to catch the fainting hobbit lest his fallshould rouse unwanted attention, Arwen settled the ancient creature intoa nook.   With catlike movements, Arwen moved to the door and eased it open. On the other side she saw the backs of two goblins and beyond a greatfray before a blazing fire.  She drew out two razor thin daggers hiddenin her midnight locks and silently sent them into the necks of thegoblins before her.  They crumpled soundlessly to the floor.  Arwen moved forward into a vast hall lined with some truly magnificentcolumns.  In the distant center of the hallway, a great fire blazed andmany goblins were milling and shouting before it.     Hmph!  Arwen thought to herself. 'Guard Room' indeed!  That foulhobbit was setting me up.  Arwen moved forward and unsheathed her elvenlong sword which glowed with white light.  She stopped and stared at theblade.   It shouldn't do that,  she thought, only one of the elder godswould.... cause.....   Arwen sprinted into the hall with her heart pounding in dread.   "Why did I delay!" cursed Gandalf. "We'll be trapped here just as theDwarrow were.  Run for it, all of you!"   Even as the company turned from the fiery blaze that held the goblinsin check, others came from separate ends of the hall flanking andpinning them.  Boromir met them in beserker rage and dealt many todeath with single, mighty blows of his sword.  Giggly hewed two with hisstout axe.  Aragon joined them and soon the threat was gone in one ickymass at their feet.   "Gandalf!  See!"  cried Lego-lass at Frodo's side.   "Is he hurt?"  shouted the wizard.  "Let me see him!"  He knelt at thehobbit's side and began searching his chest until checked by Frodo's ownhand.   "Do not worry, Gandalf,"  Frodo said, "The ring is safe."   "I.... I was checking you for wounds!  I marvel that you are alive, myfriend."   Frodo eyed the wizard with trained malice and Gandalf smiledsheepishly in return.   "See here!" Lego-lass was untying a note from the stick at Frodo'sside.  The others in the company came to Frodo to see if he was indeedall right.  Bugger, thought Sam to himself.   "We have been served,"  said Gandalf, "This is a summons from my oldmaster, Aruman/Saruman.  He has set up court for the minions of Sauron. It's a subpoena to appear before him and give account of the ring!  Damnhim!"   Rum Pah-pum, pum the drums tolled out through the hall.   Arwen was almost to the rear of the goblins by the fire and was yetunseen.  She drew out her mini-crossbow and fitted the tethered arrowshe kept strapped to her left leg.  A goblin turned her way and sheinstinctively fell into a roll to avoid the vicious slash of thegoblin's blade.  She slashed deep into the goblin's groin with a daggerand came up kneeling, took careful aim at the arched roof, and fired herarrow.  It lodged far above and the tether was taut in the handle ofthe crossbow.  She fitted it quickly to her back and whirled her bladebehind her just as another goblin was reaching her.  Many others wereadvancing warily towards the elf.   Arwen took a handful of Sindarin throwing stars and unleashed themtogether.  Only a few met their mark, but the others did enough of a jobdistracting the goblins when they exploded with loud pops a secondlater.  The goblins never got to turn back to their quarry; they each fell from vicious strokes from the blade of Arwen.    The now roused rear flank of goblins by the fire pit advanced uponher.  The elf-princess shook her raven, streaming locks from her eyesand braced.  Her eyes blazed with emerald light and her heart pounded. In a wild storm of action, she wove a savage, elegant death among thedozen goblins.   Her elvish blade sang and crimsoned as her enemiescried and clenched taloned hands to their spilling entrails and clovenjoints.  A large spear was thrust at Arwen and she danced out of itsway, spinning with sword braced high.  The goblin's head tumbled to herfeet.     While other goblins shifted warily eying the warrior-princess, Arwentook the tether in hand, sprinted for all her worth in a wide arc andleapt high when the cord caught tight in her hands. She glidedgracefully above her foes and into the recesses of the ceiling.  Fromher vantage point among the pillars of Marzipan, the elf-maid saw thecompany of the ring below her crouched beside Frodo who had fallen, butgotten up.  There you are, my love, she thought, beholding Aragonpatting the halfling about the shoulders.  Very soon, now.  Very soon Iwill be with you.  But the clear light from her dripping sword causedfear to leap into her throat once again.   Pah, rum-pah, pum-pum.  The company had regrouped and were makingfor the stair far to the end of the chamber of Marzipan. Across the longstone bridge they fled nearing the stairs that were still a gooddistance away.  The elf warrior covered their escape as best she could.   Lego-lass knocked an arrow, but she gave a gasp and it fell to theground unloosed.  Two great trolls appeared by the goblins across thechannel of fire bearing large, fell posts.  They flung the ugly stonedown to serve as a gangway over the flames.  But it was not the trollsthat filled the elf with terror.  The ranks of the goblins opened, andthey crowded away, as if they were afraid themselves.  What was comingup behind them could not be seen:  it was like a great shadow in themiddle of which was possibly a man-shape, yet greater.  Much greater.  Adread power seemed to emanate from it and Sam gulped down the urge tocry out.  He looked to Gandalf who had gone ashen as well.   The chamber echoed with a bone-shuddering "HO!  HO!  HO!"   The shape came to the edge of the fire and all light faded as if acloud had gathered.  The trolls chanted foul curses at the company ofthe ring.  As if emboldened by their cries, the shadow leapt across thefissure, flames roared up to greet it and wreathed about it; a blacksmoke swirled in the air.   "Well," muttered Boromir, "I guess we're way past subpoenasnow."      The shadow-thing burst into fire as it landed and yet remainedunharmed.  Its streaming mane of snow-white locks kindled and blazedbehind it.  In its right hand it held a sword, like a stabbing tongueof fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.  The thing wasgarbed all in red velvet and about its head was a floppy red hat.  Uponits feet were two smoldering pink slippers.   "IEYA!"  wailed Lego-lass, "A Balrog!  A Balrog is come!  Nanna -Nanna hey, debush!!"   Giggly stared with wide eyes.  "'Nanna-Nanna hey'?" he askedincredulously of the glistening elf-maid.   "Yes, well..... I was taken aback, you see...", she mumbled.     "A Balrog," said Gandalf, half to himself, "now I understand.  Thisisn't about the Frodo's property at all.  The Clause has arisen!"   The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them.     "Eat your heart out.  Look at those eyes!" commented Aragon.    "Eyes?  What about that!"  Lego-lass pointed to the great shadowthat followed the panting Balrog.   "Over the bridge!"  shouted Gandalf, "All of you!  This is a foebeyond us all. I must face it alone!"   "But Gandalf!" tittered Giggly.   "Fly, you idiots!"   The hobbits exchanged glances and Boromir said, "Eh?"     The Balrog whirled his whip about him as he approached.  The thongsstruck many of the magnificent pillars of the hall setting them alightin his wake and fury.   "Get out of here!  Get out of Moira before it's too late!"  ShoutedGandalf.   "Ohhhh, I get it,"  mused Boromir to Sam, "'Fly':  to flee, todepart hastily."   "You're sure you won't come with us?"  returned Aragon.   "Eru-dammit!  Just do as I say!!"  Gandalf whirled upon the company,his full wrath revealed to all.  The group looked upon the quiveringfigure foaming at the mouth and slowly backed away.   "Well, all right then,"  said Aragon, "if you're absolutely sure..."   Gandalf stomped his feet in exasperation. "GO!!!"   "Wait,"  said Sam, "what if we..."   "IF YOU DO NOT LEAVE NOW, SAMWISE, YOU SHALL SEE GANDALFUNCLOAKED!!"   "Ewwww,"  opined Lego-lass.   "Okay, okay, keep your shirt on,"  said Aragon, "we're leaving."  Hemustered the others and shooed them towards the exit.  Giggly,Boromir, and the hobbits reached the foot of the stairs and turned.    The Balrog reached the bridge with a nerve-shattering "HO! HO! HO!"and all were frozen by that terrible aspect except Gandalf who advancedto the foot of the bridge from the company's side.  Aragon wavedLego-lass to follow him and they approached to just behind Gandalf.  Thewizard drew out his sword which shone with a pure light.  The enemyhalted.  Its slippers smoldered with a foul stench and wreathed theBalrog in a ghastly black vapor.  The shadow poured behind it, like untovast wings. Fire shot from its nostrils and it raised its whip on high. With a crack it sent the thongs flying across the bridge, setting a postbeside Gandalf to flaming.  He ducked out of the way, but held hisground.     "Now that was entirely unprovoked," he mumbled.   "Just look at those wings!"  whispered Lego-lass.   Aragon turned to the elf disapprovingly, "Eh?" he asked.   "Well, see for yourself!"   "I see naught but a shadow like unto wings,"  Aragon commented. "Besides, you ought to know better, being of elven kind."   "Do not teach your betters, manling!"  reproached Lego-lass, "I wasthere when the Balrogs flew - Flew - down upon us at-"  They ducked asyet another post burst into flames beside them.   "You cannot pass,"  Gandalf said to the Balrog.  The goblins stoodquite still and a dead silence fell save for the quiet arguing of Aragonand Lego-lass.  Gandalf shouted, "I am a servant of the Secret Sauce..."   "Those are wings!"  insisted Lego-lass.   "Utter nonsense!  Just a shadow.  Read your lore better, elf!"retorted Aragon.   "...wielder of the flame of Arnor.  You cannot pass!"  Gandalf duckedagain as yet another pillar was set alight by the passing of theBalrog's foul whip.  "This flame war will not avail you, servant ofMattel..."   "Look, " pointed the elf, "see how the wings flap behind him!"   "Shadows dancing in the firelight,"  said Aragon who did not look.   "...Go back to your bed!  You cannot pass!" shouted Gandalf.   "I know the histories as well as you!"   "Obviously not!"   "I WAS THERE!"   "So?  Shadow!"   "Wings!"   "You know, it's sad when a mortal knows your history better than onewho 'was there'."   "Now, just wait a minute!"   By now the hall was filled with flaming posts and the Trolls chantedtheir vulgarities. From out of the shadow, the Balrog raised itsfire-red sword. Gandalf's glittered white in return.   There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire.  The Balrog fellback and its sword flew up in molten fragments.  Gandalf staggered butremained standing.   Far across the hallway they heard a high voice cry out, "No, Gandalf!"    High in the rafters, Arwen saw a slime and dust covered hobbit runningacross the hallway directly towards the goblins.  She cursed her luckrealizing he was oblivious to his peril in his panic flight towards thewizard.  She gathered up the slack tether in her hands and bounded fromher pillar.   In a wide arc she swung, playing out the tether tautly in hergloves which were quickly being eaten away by its passing.  She pickedher moment and swung round her legs as the arc came to apogee andsnatched Pipsqueak by the collar as she swung back over the fire and thescrabbling hands of the goblins.  Just as their flight brought them tothe shoulder of the Balrog, Arwen loosed the tether and rolled mid-airover the fell beast and came down in a deep roll on the other side ofthe bridge holding tightly to the slimy and screaming Pipsqueak.  Whenshe looked up, Arwen found that all eyes were riveted on the Balrogexcept Aragon and Lego-lass who seemed deep in discussion.   Pipsqueak fought free of Arwen's bosom and made his way hazily towards his beckoning companions at the far end of the chamber.  Suddenly he came to himself and started about.   "Gandalf?"  He stumbled in the wizard's direction.   "Wait, Pipsqueak!"  the hobbits shouted after him from far down thehall.  "Arwen, stop him!"   "Gandalf, don't do it!"  cried Pipsqueak as he sped towards thewizard.  Arwen reached for the halfling, but the slime caused her grip toslip.   "You cannot pass!"  said Gandalf.  The Balrog leapt up full upon thebridge and drew itself up to great height.  Its wings spread from wallto wall...   "See?  Told you, manling!"   "He's just being 'figurative'!"   ...its whip whirling,  lighting the chamber with more flaming posts.   "You're serious?  You do not see its wings?"   "Shhh!  We're getting to the good bit!"   "But-"   "SHHH"   Gandalf raised on high his staff and crying, smote the stone beforehim.  The staff broke asunder.  A blinding sheet of white light sprangup.    "Gandalf!"  At that moment, Pipsqueak barreled into the old wizardfrom behind holding desperately onto his knees.    The bridge cracked.  Right at the Balrog's fast-smoldering pinkslippers it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into thegulf.   With a terrible cry of "HOOOooooooo", the Balrog and its shadowplunged down and vanished.   Gandalf tried to whirl around at the shout of his name, but theimpact of the hobbit combined with his turning sent Gandalf off hisbalance.   "Oh, Gandalf!  Don't do it!"  cried Pipsqueak, letting go of thewizard's knees.  The sudden release of his legs sent the wizard spinningback with his arms flailing helplessly for support.   Gandalf fell backwards over the edge of the chasm with a cry. Pipsqueak blinked.   "All right, smart girl," pouted Aragon to Lego-lass, "If he's got wingswhy doesn't he fly out?"   "Gandalf!"  Pipsqueak sobbed down the chasm.   "Fine!" said Lego-lass, advancing to the pit.  Aragon followed. Leaning over, the elf shouted down, "Gandalf!  Does the Balrog havewings?"   From the depths they heard the faint shout of the receding wizard,"Fly, you fool!  Fly!"   Boromir arrived panting.  He had been deputized to find out whatthe hold up was.  Close behind was the disheveled yet stunning Arwen.   "Ah, well, there we are!"  shrugged Lego-lass to Aragon.   "What do you mean?"  replied Aragon.   "Gandalf just said it!"   "No, he said 'Fly'.  What does 'fly' mean?"   "That the Balrog has wings!  He told it to fly:  to save them both,obviously!"   "Hang on," Aragon leaned over the pit and cupped his hands aroundhis mouth.  Before he could shout down to Gandalf he felt a tapping onhis shoulder.  He looked up into Arwen's blazing eyes.   "I think he means us!"  She pointed across the pit.  There they sawthe goblins summoning forth more trolls with posts to use as a bridgeacross the chasm.   "Arwen?" said Aragon in astonishment.   "Yes,"  Arwen beamed with affected cheerfulness, "Hi honey, I'mback!"  Then with ferocity, "Now can we GO?!"   Aragon looked back to the goblins beginning to cross the chasm.  "Oh,right." Man and elf-maidens bolted towards the exit. Boromirscooped up Pipsqueak like so much dead-meat and ran after them.   Up the stairs the company fled.  Frodo heard Sam giggling beside himand realized he himself was tittering as he ran.  Things were lookingup. Pah, Rum-pah pum-Pum the drum-beats rolled behind, mournful nowand slow; Pum!   They ran on.  Light grew before them and they saw the way out of themountain held against them by two goblins bearing what lookedsuspiciously like subpoenas.  Aragon cleaved the Captain in twain in hisfury.  He was wonderly wroth!  The company swept past the other goblin,paying him no heed.  Out of the gates they ran and sprang down the hugeand age worn stairs.   "Just you wait, halfling,"  whispered Boromir to his gentlyweeping burden.  "I marked what you did at the bridge.  Your lot will behard indeed, and you know what I desire!"  Fresh wails were thehobbit's only reply.   At last, the company of the Ring came beyond hope under the sky andfelt the wind on their faces.   They did not halt until they were a goodly distance from the blackmouth of the Gates of Moira, near the Dimrill Dale.   They looked back and beheld the smoke rising from the mouth of Moira.  Far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats; Pah, rum-pahpum-Pum.  Grief at last overcame some of the party, but where sat thehobbits, only feigned sighs of remorse were heard.  Morrie eyedPipsqueak cautiously.  Yes, a great hurdle to Frodo's inheritance wasgone.    Rum, pah-pum Pum.  The drum beats faded.   But Aragon was still among them...
    "I fear we can stay here no longer," said Aragon. Looking at the mountains,raising high his sword he cried: "Farewell, Gandalf! Why did I not warn you: If you pass through Moira, beware!" This produced a suppressed snickering and a "yeah right", but silence returned among the partly griefstricken group when Aragon shot an angry glance in the general direction ofthe hobbits. He decided no to vent any more anger and grief at this point asthey were clearly not shared by all.    The company got up and looked around them. The scenery was as dreary ascould be expected of a ski resort in high season, but still Aragon felt theneed to point out some landmarks. "Over there are the Rimdilstairs. Next to those waterfalls is where we should have come down, had fate been kinder to us."    "Or bureacracy and corruption less rampant," added Giggly. "Curse thosegreedy bastards, waylaying innocent travelers with outrageous visademands!" And he actually looked quite endearing, shaking his cute littlefist, still red from orc blood.    "Well, enough enjoying the scenery. As I am senior, I will lead you now and the next stop is Lorien." Aragon was still annoyed that some in the company suspected him of being less than totally sincere in his grieving forGandalf, and now wanted to drive the ungrateful scum into the ground byforced march.    "Wait up, hoss," said Boromir. "Who died and made you boss?" For asecond he looked more like a sheep than a 37th generation sheep, coming fromgood sheep stock, bred in good sheep country and genetically engineered tolook and feel even more like sheep than your average sheep. He quicklyovercame his embarrasment and said "Well, okay, Gandalf died, but did he makeyou boss?"    "Actually he did," smirked Aragon, "In closed chambers I wasnamed SiC, in case anything happened to him, like SABOTAGE - " (malicious look at the hobbits) " - or a 5TH COLUMN" (more looks-that-could-kill).    "Oh yeah?! Just 'cause you say so doesn't make it so. Got any proof?"Boromir wasn't about to give up now, his foot was so far in his mouth,it couldn't possibly get any worse.    Aragon produced a very official looking document, and the reason it lookedso official was that it was indeed official. It stated that should Gandalffall in any cracks anywhere, Aragon, son of Arathon, the guy with the broken--reforged sword, was to lead the company in his stead. It carried the internationally recognised Veriseal, so it must be OK then.    They followed Aragon down the mountain, some more willing than others.Boromir was clearly not happy, muttering something about "sly motherf..always an answer to everything," but the rest of the company ignored him.As they left the East gate of Moira behind them they started encounteringruins of sorts, and Giggly overcame some of his grief as he thought he recognised the surroundings.    "That must be Durin's Stone," he exclaimed, "I can't pass it without looking at the wonder of the valley."    "Be quick about it then," said Aragon, thoroughly enjoying his new role, and starting to wish Gandalf had departed quite a bit sooner. "We'll be safeonce we're in Lothlorien, and Wednesday is meatloafday. We don't want tomiss that." He didn't add that the last thing he wanted was to get hismother-in-law's mother angry by being late, and she was known for hertemper.    Giggly jogged towards the stone pillar, and called for Frodo to follow him.Frodo's upper body was aching from the impact of the orc's stick, but he wasstrangely attracted to the silent blue water, and the scent that hung overthe place.    Together they stood still, for a moment in grave silence, in awe of themoment, and of the history of the place.    "This pillar marks the spot where the Dwarves first erected a McDonaldsconcession. Cholesterol levels have never been the same, but you just can'tbeat that Quarter Pounder cheese, now can you?" Giggly was clearly overcomewith emotion, but Frodo just wished that more of the once proud restaurantremained than the lingering smell of hamburgers and fries.    "Oh Ronald McDonald, succulent and juicy," said Giggly. "There it lies, the Big Mac, until the Power comes back on," and with a bow he left.    "What did you see?" Pipsqueak asked Frodo on his return, but Frodo couldn't bring himself to torment his companion with descriptions of menus and smells, and remained silent.    Aragon now led the company south, over a steep path down. "I will lead you on the road that Gandalf chose," unnecessarily emphasizing himself butwanting to shut Boromir and any other would-be contenders up for good."First I hope to get to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the GreatRiver - " he pointed, " - Over There." He immediately realized this didn'tsound very authorative but it was too late.    "Hope? Hope? Do you actually have any idea where we're headed?" askedBoromir smugly.    "Wh- when I said 'Hope', I- I- I- meant to- to arrive safely," stammeredAragon, experiencing a sinking feeling not felt since a certain luxurycruiseship thought unsinkable proved not to be. But once again an elf maidcame to his rescue, although this time it was Lego-lass.    "There lie the plains of Lothlorien, fairest of all dwellings of my people.There are no trees in that country - at least there didn't used to be, theywere all cut down, for the leaves of the trees were made into a currency andsubsequently its entire population became millionaires overnight. But theyspent the money well and now they run some of the finest, most exquisitegolf courses in Middle Earth. Teeing off is said to induce a state ofeuphoria, and putting in Lorien is praised above all else in the songs wesing in Mirkwood. My heart would be glad to behold a golf bat in Spring, inLorien."    "It's a club, and I'll be glad even if it were winter. But it's still quite some distance," (again cursing himself for his indecisiveness) "and we have to hurry."    "Do you have to be a member-" Arwen tried to ask, but she was interrupted.    "I have to rest," Frodo cried. The jog with Giggly and the gnawing hungryfeeling the hamburger joint had awoken had compounded the pain in his sidefrom the orc stick, and suddenly his strength was gone. Aragon silentlycursed him for spoiling his planned forced march, but he feinged compassionand ran to Frodo.    "I am so sorry, Frodo! In all the confusion I forgot about your ordeal, and, well, you seemed all right what with how you rocketed up the mountain after Giggly like a decathlon champion on benzedrine. Please forgive my insensitivity. Come! A little further up is a place where we can rest, and I shall tend to your injuries. Boromir, carry him."    Feeling very pleased with himself for that last command, he turned and led them to a small clearing. A fire was made, and Aragon examined Frodo. Frodo dreaded taking his clothes off. The memory of being taunted mercilessly was enough to make him shudder, but even more he feared that all would discover his theft of Bilbo's unique and priceless mithril mail coat.    "I'm all right," he writhed. "All I need is a McChicken and a Coke." His squirming came as much from the pain as from the image of being exposed as the thieving little sh*t that he now thought himself to be.    "No," said Aragon. "I'm surprised at all that you're still alive after nearly being impaled with that orc twig, and I'd be negligent in my duties as aresponsible leader if I didn't do all that I can to relieve your pain."That sounded quite sincere, if a little contrived.    He carefully removed Frodo's jacket, and started laughing uncontrollably."No wonder it hurts! Giggly, look at what the little hobbit princeling iswearing!" Aragon could no longer control his limbs and fell on his kneeswith laughter. When Giggly approached and saw what made Aragon suffer fits,he also burst out laughing. "What is THAT?! What are you wearing??"Frodo looked at the coat, and saw that it was all rusted, and where thestick had impacted it had broken, the rings being driven into his flesh andthe wound already infecting.    "Wait, wait, don't tell me, it's the coat Thorin gave Bilbo when hesupposedly forgave him on his deathbed. I knew Bilbo was thick, but who'sever heard of a forgiving dwarf, and then one who's been robbed of what heholds dearest in all the world? Come ON! That thing is cursed worse thanTinwelint's treasure! Let alone that it's made of tin..."    "I expected better from you than to accept that as a gift from Bilbo, Frodo. All in Rivendell knew that it was an evil thing Thorin gave to Bilbo." But Frodo was just relieved that everyone in the company assumed Bilbo had given the damn thing to him. He felt better already, and his spirit rose even more when Aragon, feeling magnanimous, decided to allow the company a dose ofVala dust. He could do no wrong after that.    After coming down from their trip, the company ran out of excuses to avoid the forced march Aragon had set his mind on, and so they progressed atneckbreaking speed through the dark. The country passed them by, until agolden flickering seemed to envelop them. They came to a halt, and noticedthat a high dense forest was before them. In the pale light of the starsthey saw that it was the leaves that shone the pale light.    At the edge of the treeline a sign lay on its side, and Aragon stooped and picked it up.    "Lothlorien. Population 23.726 and waning. Galadriel and Dullbornpresiding."    Mystery was written on the faces of Aragon, Lego-lass and Arwen. The hobbits were as usual out of it, Boromir smelled another chance to confront Aragon with his (alleged) inadequacies and only Giggly remained relaxed, with a patient, almost serene expression on his face. Vala dust can do that to a dwarf.    "It can't be," said Lego-lass. "There haven't been any trees for as long as my people can rememer, in fact since the battle in which the last Balrogsquadron, led by the Red Balrog with triple wing configuration, was defeated. And where are the fabled golf courses?"    "Don't start that again! I don't know where your precious golf courses are, but I have a feeling we're about to find out," said Aragon. He paused,then added for effect "But it's quiet here, too -,"    "Oh come off it, it's quiet because THERE'S NO ONE HERE! Now let's getpacking, I for one want to see this witch!" Boromir's rude interruptionmade Aragon spasm with anger, and it was all he could do to control himselfand not run Anduril through that upstart Steward's heir. That reminded him,he could just fire the moron, and his father while he was at it...    His musings were interrupted by Lego-lass, who with typical Elven delicacywas blundering into the forest, making a raucous like a herd of oliphaunts.The company had no choice but to follow, and so they did. After a short whilethey came upon a fastflowing river, and Lego-lass recognized it as Nimrodel,exclaiming, "Any elf would recognize the voice of this water, we made manysongs about it and the golden flowers that floated in her foaming current."    "Or maybe she knew by the sign here, saying 'Nimrodel'. She's such a bimbo." Arwen was clearly getting annoyed at Lego-lass, for reasons as yet unclear to the company.    "Follow me, guys," said Lego-lass. "The water soothes aching feet, and it's not very deep!" She climbed off the steep bank and disappeared immediatelyin the swirling cauldron. It took the combined efforts of Boromir (whoacted before Aragon had a chance to order him), Giggly and Arwen to pull herfrom the freezing water. "Per - Haps -We - Should -Try -At -An -Oth - Er -Cros- Sing," she gulped. Aragon felt his control of the company slipping,and while cohesion had never been a strong point, now it seemed as if thegroup was falling apart. Well, tough.    Lego-lass regained her composure rapidly, in spite of the incessant backbeating by Arwen, who was pretending to help Lego-lass get rid of the waterin her lungs. "Do you hear the voice of - Arwen, will you stop that?! - Thevoice of Nim - Leave me alone will ya?! I can hear the voice of the river,it reminds me of a song my people sing. I will try to translate it intoWestron."    In a soft voice the elf began:          There once was an old elven-maid          With nothing to do all day          Spent time and money on trendy clothes          Just had to have her way          Her hair was white, her limbs were gone          And she was fairly free;          And in the wind her ribcage whistled          Like chimes in a linden-tree          Where now she wanders none can tell          In Bondstreet or Times Square          Her creditcards were all revoked          Her bankaccounts laid bare          A wind by night in Projects-South          Arose, and bad it stunk          Drove shopping trolley thru the street          And she lost all her spunk          Amroth beheld his bankuptcy          And cursed the faithless b*tch          His debt now stacked too high to see          His credit blown to bits          From window high they saw him leap          a sack of flour from a barn          plunge to the streets below, so deep          Ending this sad sad yarn    "I apologise if the translation is less than perfect, but I'm sure you all get the drift of the story. It's very sad, for it tells how greed came to Lorien, when the dwarves wakened bureaucracy and corruption in themountains."    "But the dwarves did not make the bureaucracy and corruption," said Giggly.    "Don't get so defensive, shorty; I never said they did."    Aragon decided this was the moment to reestablish his leadership, and rounded them all up. He led them deeper into the forest, until it became todark to see, and it was decided to make camp. Following Lego-lass' advicethey were about to climb the trees, which seemed the safest place to sleep,when a commanding voice sounded from the trees. Unexpectedly, they had foundelves of Lorien, and they felt safer. As Aragon had a bad case of vertigo,he had no choice but to deputize Lego-lass to talk to them. She disappearedup a tree and came back down after half an hour or so.    "It seems Halfwit, Rummage and Orphan knew we were coming, and anyway, they heard me nearly drown and then cough my lungs out back at the river, so they let us pass. They'll escort us to Galadriel and Dullborn, but because elves hate dwarves - as my dad showed your dad, Giggles - and the Lorien folk have not yet been infected with the Political Correctnes virus, Giggly will have to be gagged, blindfolded and tied to a pole, after receiving the mandatory flogging of course... No, I'm kidding, but a blindfold will be necessary."    The dwarf made no objections, and aside from some torn ligaments and abroken nose there followed an uneventful leisurely walk until Halfwit froze,and the entire company felt the tension.    "Yrch!" said the elf in a hissing whisper, staring into the darkness, andthey heard him sniffing as well.    "What is it? Not orcs, I hope," whispered Aragon to Lego-lass.    "No, he just stepped in some dog doodie. Probably from one of Galadriel's; they tell me she lets those mutts run around free all the time, and this is what you get."    The company tried to walk more carefully after that, but it was no use,sooner or later they all stepped in it, except Giggly, who somehow managedto use the elf leading him as guide to where not to tread.    For that night and the next day they walked, and apart from the occasionalrest, which invariably involved a small picnic (these elves were not used tobingeing Hobbits, and had yet to learn to say No) it was all pretty boring,so a routine evolved whereby one member would talk to Giggly, and another(Morrie volunteered for this more than the others) would curl up into arock-like position, placing himself in Giggly's path. The dwarf's guide washappy to cooperate, and they laughed themselves silly as the poor Dwarftripped and fell time after time, being warned just a little too late everytime. It made time pass by more quickly for all involved.    In the afternoon more elves joined the company, and Giggly's blindfold wasremoved. "Galadriel has personally ordered this. You are the first dwarf tobehold the Course of the Naith of Lorien since Durin's day!"    Before them stretched what must have been the only remaining golf course in the entire elven realm, but what a beauty it was. Its grass was justgreener, its sand was just - well, you know; it was an elven version of aperfect golf course.    "Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth," said Halfwit. "For this is the heart of the acient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of Amroth,where they buried what they managed to scrape off the pavement after hisunfortunate fall."    The others cast themselves down upon the grass, but Frodo had never playedgolf, had never even seen a golf cart, and badly wanted to drive one. Hethought he had managed to sneak away unseen and sat down behind the wheel ofbeautifully cream colored cart, when Aragon sat down next to him. He feltcaught, but Aragon put him at ease.    "This is the best golf course on earth," he said, and added with what canonly be described as a malicious smirk, "and here I scored a hole-in-one forthe first time in my life, and this was before I ever learned to playgolf...You have not scored yet, but your luck may change." And feelingmagnanimous once more, he took Frodo's hand and showed him the way toArwen's cousin's dwellings, and came there as healthy men do.
     The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and it was far too dark toplay golf when Aragon and Frodo cleaned themselves up, got dressed, andwent on again.  Night came beneath the trees as they walked, and lamps ofNoldorin crystal automatically lit up the forest -- though Frodo noticedtheir odd tendency to flicker off as he passed beneath them.     Suddenly they came out into the open again, and found themselvesstaring up at a glittering palace all made of crystal and coloured glass. Delicate spires and tiny minarets of Elven-colour were cleverly woven intoa beautifully designed castle.  A splendid sight.  It was the home ofGaladriel, the Elvenqueen.     Frodo gasped.  "Is this where Galadriel lives?" he asked, disregardingthe previous sentence.     Aragorn shook his head.  "No, this is just the set for a previousmovie, which never got made because of, er, contractual difficulties. Galadriel actually lives over here."  He pointed to a thicket of thebrambly shrubs that the elves name ferlyrn,  upon the highest of which wasperched a rough structure of boards nailed hastily together, with a ropeladder dangling therefrom.  Above the platform was the crudely letteredsign:                  GLADREEL'S TREE HOWS                     (DULBORNS 2!)               POZITIVLY NO DWERWS ALOUD!!!!     Ever since Frodo had set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode, astrange feeling had come upon him; it seemed to him that his head ached,there was a sour taste on his tongue and that now and then lights wouldflash before of his eyes.  Now, as he stood looking up the ladder towardsthe treehouse, a rush like a great green wave drowning the fair land ofNumenor came over him, and he suddenly perceived Reality.     He looked down, and saw that his feet had sprouted roots and weresinking deep, deep into the fertile loam, spreading out so that he couldfeel clearly every grain of mould beneath him; each blade of grass sprangup, keenly speaking its aliveness, and he felt a sudden kinship with thetree that rose up before him.  He could feel it growing, see it rising upinto the sky and spreading its leaves, thirstily draining the aquifer...Frodo staggered back, overcome by the knowledge.  He looked beside him, andsaw Aragon staring down at him with glittering eyes.     "Are you all right, Frodo?" he said -- but his voice seemed to comefrom a long way away, as if from the bottom of a well.     Frodo tried to say "yes", but his voice came out strangely, and itseemed as if something or someone else was speaking for him.  "Would youbelieve me," it said, "if I told you I was being followed by a yellowNazdaq?"     "Nooo..." said Aragon's distant voice, and suddenly Aragon twistedinto a tiny blue marble and shot away into the distance.  Frodo shook hishead, saw the rope ladder before him, and began to climb.     It seemed to him that the ladder rose up forever, and that he had tostop many times before he reached the top.  At each stage he marked thegreat leaves that grew out from the trunk, overshadowing the groups ofelves that sat chatting beneath; while huge black ants roamed up and downthe tree, on their endless quest for Meaning and Food.  Woodlice he saw,and moths resting upon the sad grey bark of the forlorn.  Up, up heclimbed, until he reached the stratosphere, the svarga heaven above thestars, the jungle canopy where the spider monkeys brachiate from branch tobranch.  The treehouse floor stretched broad and fair before him, and itsfloor was made of lapis lazuli; through the floor he could see theconstellations glimmering fair beneath him. "Cassiopeia," he said tohimself.     And there they were, seated upon golden thrones underneath a tapestryglittering with Jewels: the Lord and the Lady.  The Lord was tall and darkbearded, hairy-chested like a satyr and brimming with virility; he held asilver athame in his head.  The Lady was also tall and deep-cleavaged, withbroad hips like the Willendorf Venus, and in her hand was a fluted chaliceof gold.  Secret symbols were drawn upon the floor.     Frodo stood before them, wordless.  The Lord welcomed him in his owntongue, saying, "A, peryando tiucumba váratalya limbenengwea!  Auta!"  TheLady said no word, but merely licked her lips.  And Frodo knew at thatmoment that they had looked deep into his soul and perceived the essentialoneness that connected them both at that moment.     Dullborn, perceiving that Frodo was still there, not having understooda word he had said, used sign language to indicate that he should go standin a corner, while he interrogated the remainder of the company, who hadmysteriously materialized on the lapis lazuli.  "So, Aragon son ofArathon," he said, "Did you off Gandalf before he could pay me back thethree thousand miriain he owed me?"     "Nay," said Galadriel, her voice resonating like a cracked theorbo. "Aragon never had the wit to do away with Gandalf.  Now tell us where heis, for he oweth us both money and favors."  She crossed her legs.     "Alas!" said Aragon.  "Gandalf was lost in the depths of Moira, takenby a shadow and a flame, which had no wings..."     Lego-lass stepped on Aragon's foot, hard.  "It was a Balrog ofMortgage," she said.  "Its wings spread from wall to wall, over a span ofthirty years."     The dismayed cries of the Elves rang out.  "Gandalf?  Lost?  Withoutheirs, beneficiaries, or estate?  Now whom can we sue?"     Lord Dullborn stood up straight and tall.  "At such a grim time," hesaid, "a time of sadness and loss for us all, when strong leadership isrequired more than ever, there is only one thing for us to do..."     "That's right!" said Halfwit the Elf.     "...blame the Dwerrows!"     "The Dwerrows!  It's all the fault of the Dwerrows!  Expel 'em!  Takeaway their property!  Sterilize 'em!  Hang 'em!  Fry 'em in oil! Zwerge'raus!"  These were among the more printable remarks made by the Elvesassembled there.     Galadriel coughed, and the treehouse fell silent.  "While it is wellknown to all of us," she said, looking at Giggly, "that Dwerrows arehideous, gnarled, shrunken mutants, with a barbarous speech, no manners,and a long history of elf-molestation, they are still not to blame foreverything -- just most things.  Besides, who can blame the Dwerrow if hewished to gaze at last at his ancestral home whose entrance lies deep atthe head of that shadowy vale between the mountains known as the Limbs ofMoira?"     "Dark are the waters of Kleo-patrâ, and warm, oh, warm are the springsof Kunni-gonda," she chanted, running the tip of her tongue over the topsof her lower teeth.       And Giggly, on hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue,looked up as far as he could; and it seemed to him that he looked suddenlyinto the heart of a perfect stranger and saw there lust and amorous desire. He smiled in answer, rose, and said politely, "You can visit me any time."     There was a deathly silence, during which Galadriel stared hard ateach member of the Company.  At length Dullborn spoke again.  "Get the hellout of here, all of you."     That night the Company slept on the ground, as no self-respecting Elfwould allow them into their treehouses.   For a little while the travellersargued among themselves, engaging in unrestrained slander, backbiting, andfeeble excuses for their behaviour.     "What were you wriggling for, Sam?" interrogated Pipsqueak.  "Maybeplanning on cutting me and Morrie out of the action?"     "I never thought no such thing," answered Sam.  "If you want to know,I felt as if the Lady was looking right through my tunic and seeing the'Rosie' tattoo on my chest."     "And the little fluffy pink lambs embroidered on your shorts," Morrieadded helpfully.     "Hey!"     "To me it seemed exceedingly strange," said Boromir.  "For thoughthey say in our land that the Lady of the Golden Wood possesseth X-rayvision as well as superhuman endurance, I did marvel that she passed over aman of my physique so hastily."     When Aragon had calmed them all down, he bade them sleep well for thenight.  "And if you must go outside, take with you a handful of leaves ofthe forlorn; for there is in this land no toilet paper, unless a man bringit hither himself.  Then let him beware!"     They remained some days in Lothlorien, so far as they could tell, butsince their watches had all been confiscated at the border, they tended tolose track of time.  All the while they dwelt there Frodo's symptomsremained unchanged.  They had not seen the Lord or Lady again, and theElven-folk shunned them as if they were rabid lepers, except for two:Lego-lass spent all her time among the Elves, and pretended not to see thecompanions if they passed near; and Giggly was often seen returning fromGaladriel's treehouse well after midnight, and the others wondered at this.          And after some weeks had passed, the companions held a wake forGandalf.  They could sometimes - if they eavesdropped - overhear the Elvesmentioning his Elvish name, Mesprendeur; but if Lego-lass was with thecompany, she would not interpret for them, saying that if they wanted herto be an interpreter they could bloody well pay her, and in any case theremarks were far too rude.     It was Frodo who first put something of his feelings into words, asthey sat in a circle, talking about their memories of the old bum, andgetting roaring drunk.  Frodo had been listening to the Elves singing aboutGandalf, but as he had never gotten better than a C+ in Sindarin class, andmoreover they spoke it with a strong Québecois accent, he understood hardlyanything of what he had heard, and his translation, as repeated to Sam,must be regarded as if he had made it all up himself.          Picture yourself in a wood by a river,           With golden-leaved trees of unusual size;           Words incomprehensible call to remind you,           The elf with the silmaril eyes.           Elanor flowers of silver and gold,           Springing upon the green lawn.           Look for the elf with the clouds in her hair,           And she's gone.           Varda in the sky with starlight           Varda in the sky with starlight          Varda in the sky with starlight          A....           Follow her down to a grove in the forest           Where feather-tressed maidens spread marshmallow thighs,           Niphredils rise around you under mallorns           That grow so incredibly high.           A boat with a swan's prow rows on by the shore,           Waiting to take you away.           Sit in the stern with your face to Mordor,           And you're gone.           Varda in the sky with starlight           Varda in the sky with starlight          Varda in the sky with starlight          A....           Picture yourself on a ship in the Ocean,           With oddly-dressed elves wearing beards for disguise,           Suddenly someone is there on an island,           The elf with the silmaril eyes.           Varda in the sky with starlight           Varda in the sky with starlight          Varda in the sky with starlight          A....     "But that doesn't have anything to do with Gandalf at all," Sam objected.     "Well, finish it yourself, then," Frodo replied sourly.     "How about this," said Sam:          Hamburger and fries with ketchup,          Hamburger and fries with ketchup,          Hamburger and fries with ketchup,          Hamburger and fries with ketchup...     Frodo kicked Sam all the way back to the tent.     One evening, after Frodo and Sam had finally kissed and made up, Frodoasked: "So, Sam, do you think you've seen enough of the Elves?"     "I reckon I have, Master," Sam replied.  "They're interesting enoughto start with, but spend a few months with them and they're horribly dull."     Even as he spoke, as if in answer to his words, there was a sharpcough and the Lady Galadriel stood before them.  She spoke no word, butoffered them a glimpse of well-rounded calf and ankle, and they followedwillingly enough.  She led them behind the thicket of treehouses into adamp, mossy little garden, ornamented with a mirrored globe, a sundial, anda stone dwarf that was remarkably lifelike except for the lichens growingupon him.     At the bottom of the garden stood a birdbath filled to the brim withwater.  Galadriel stooped and breathed on it, and when the water was stillagain she spoke.  "Here is the Birdbath of Galadriel," she said.  "I havebrought you here so that you may look in it, if you will."     Sam muscled his way past Frodo.  "I'll have a look," he said.  Hestepped up on a brick and leaned over the basin.  "There's only sparrowdroppings, as I thought," he said.  But suddenly the Birdbath turned muddy,then clear.  Sam gasped. "Hey!" he shouted.  "There's Ted getting amonopoly on the industrial waste reprocessing business.  I wish I could getat Ted, and I'd reprocess him!"     Galadriel shook her head.  "Remember that the Birdbath shows manythings, and not all have yet come to pass.  Some never come to be, unlessthose that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them."     Sam looked puzzled.  "So you mean that if I don't go back to the Shireto fix old Ted's waggon, he won't be turning Bywater Pool into a dump fortoxic sludge?"     Galadriel snickered behind her hand.  "Well, if you do go back, thenit certainly will happen; and if you don't go back, it won't necessarilynot happen; and if I use conditional sentences that are complicated enoughand have enough multiple negatives, you will get so confused that you'llstop asking questions and go with the narrative flow.  Do you understand?"     "No."     "Excellent.  Frodo, it's your turn."     Frodo stepped up to the Birdbath.  The night was dark, and its velvetseemed to stream away from him in waves of purple and indigo, while thestars played their eerie flutes inside his head.  The water swayed beforehim as he bent over the basin.  His jaw dropped, and saliva began to dripfrom his lower lip.     "What do you see?" Galadriel asked.     "I see..." Frodo replied dully, "an Eye... filling nearly all thewater... it is glazed... yellow as a cat's... watchful... intent... but itspupil opens onto a pit... a window into Absolute Nothingness... thatHideous Void where Space and Time become naught, where all individuality isdestroyed, where Azathoth pipes his hideous flutes to the nameless tunes ofNyarlathotep!"  Frodo's voice, at first low and sluggish, had risen to ashrill scream.     "Oh," said Galadriel.  "That must be Tivil."  She sighed, rolled upher right sleeve, reached deep into the Birdbath up above her elbow, andhauled out a twisting, hissing creature.  She held it up and looked at itaccusingly.  It glared back at her through a yellow, slitted eye.     "Naughty beast!" Galadriel said.  "How many times have I told you notto hide in there?  Be along with you now."  She released it in midair,where it stretched itself out to reveal scaly flanks, long furry finstipped with claws, and a whiskery face that it wiped with its forefins. Mewing, it flexed its broad, striped tail and swam away through the airinto the trees.     "Anyway," Galadriel said, "I know what you thought you saw.  But I sayto you, Frodo, that however the Dark Lord tries to grope me, still the dooris closed!" She turned to the East, crossing her arms and legs in a gestureof rejection and denial.     "Wow," said Frodo.  "You are beautiful and sexy, Lady Galadriel.  Iwill give you the One Ring, if you want it."     Galadriel tossed her head in the gesture known to the Elves as themaewest.  "That's enough from you," she replied.  "Maybe a lot of othergirls would fall for that line, but not me.  You see, already all love meand despair."     She lifted up her hand, and from a cleverly hidden spotlight thereissued a great light that illumined her alone and left all else dark. Moody music with lots of violins emanated from out the thick air, and allaround the garden came the click of the cameras of the paparazzi.       Then she let her hand fall, and the spot switched off.  "So you see,"she continued, "I don't need anything at all that you can offer."  Sheturned to Sam, who sat cowering in the dirt.  "Have you understood anythingat all that you've seen here?"     "No, Lady," he replied humbly.  "But can I have your autograph?"
    That night the Company was again summoned to the ramshackle tree hut of Galadriel (and Dullborn the Wise). There Dullborn the Wise spoke to them and bade them to hasten their departure for "the time to leavedraweth nigh," as he said. "But before thou leavest (and we canfinally get rid of this bothersome dwarf) thou must decide where tomake for when thou set forth."    Then Galadriel looked at each of the Company and said "They are as yet undecided, every one of them."    Aragon at once spoke up. "As leader of this Company I deem it best if we make directly for ... eh ... for ... eh ... Mordor! Yes! Mordor! We have to destroy the Ring. It is too dangerous a thing for Elf ormortal to wield. And we have to claim Frodo's inheritance, of course."    At the mention of his name Frodo looked up smiling. "Inheritance. Oh yes. Blue niphredils in high fields of green. Purple waters of Nurnen reflecting the starlight of Varda in clear skies. Horses thundering over yellow fields of corn..."    Into the ensuing silence Pipsqueak peeped, "But what about Isengard? What about Aruman's subpoena? Don't we have to go there first?"    "Well, yes," Aragon said. "Isengard. Of course we are going to make for Isengard first. Never meant to do anything else."    "Subpoena. You're gonna bow before some stupid law? I'll do thisto your stupid subpoena!" Morrie brawled and flashed one of his knifesmenacingly while Lego-lass asked, "But how do we know Aruman is stillin Isengard and hasn't been summoned to Mordor?"    Boromir declared firmly, "I think we should make for Gondor, for my home town of Minas Tirith."    Giggly giggled excitedly. Arwen nudged Aragon sideways and Aragon decided that he best reassert his authority and fast. He spoke up and decisively said "Eh... I... eh ..."    "At least thou shouldst decide which side of the River thou wantstto take," Dullborn the Wise's deep voice broke into the confusion.Everyone looked up at him except Frodo who was studying the ceilingand smiling.    "Well, that's easy," Aragon declaimed firmly, "we will take the west side... No, I meant the east side... Or west?"    Galadriel spoke up. "Well, apparently you need time yet to decide.But my wise husband has thought of a way to help you.." Dullborn the Wiselooked perplexed. "They will be travelling along a RIVER," Galadrielnudged, "and don't know which SIDE to take." Dullborn the Wise staredblankly at her. "With RIVERS you don't need to take SIDES." Galadriellooked imploringly at her husband. "With the right EQUIPMENT you candelay the choosing." Still nothing. "You can just FLOAT along..."    "Ah, yes," Dullborn declared wisely, "we will lend thou rafts. Thenthou canst travel ON the river and needest not make so portentous adecision hastily as which side thou wouldst take."    Galadriel sighed, "What the wise and noble Dullborn meant is we would have lent you rafts if we still had enough trees to fell and build them with. Instead Dullborn the Wise generously lets you take some of our fast elvish rowboats. They need rowers, yes, but we can bind three of them together and then your manservant, Sam, can row all of you."    They accepted the offer gratefully (except for Sam who mutteredsomething about imperialist opressors and revolution).    "All, that is," Galadriel amended, "except for you, Arwen." She looked at her granddaughter. "Your father El Rond has sent an Eagle fromRivendell with a message ordering you to come home at once."    "Eagle," Boromir cried, at the same time that Giggly, jumping excitely up and down, asked, "Is it still here? Is it?"    "Why, no, I sent it back." Galadriel looked flustered. "Did you want to send a message back?"    "We thought," Aragon began, "We could have... Oh, never mind."    Arwen's face had darkened during this conversation. Now she spoke up. "I am definitely NOT going back. Now when things get interesting and I even might become the heroine of the upcoming movie instead of asidekick, I'll definitely NOT be going home!"    Galadriel smiled benevolently at her. Lights played on her hair and the soft music of violins welled up from the background. "Well, yes, I can see that a chance at fame cannot be passed over," she said. "I will write a letter to El Rond and explain. He will understand."    "And now," Galadriel continued, "it is time for presents." Sheclapped her hands and fair Elf maidens entered bearing the presents ofGaladriel and Dullborn for the company of the Ring. To Aragon asleader of the party she gave a green gem, and said, "This is theElfstone foretold of old, heirloom of the House of Gil-Gallamine. Mayit bring you more luck than its last bearer and may it be a warning toyou: The time of relaxing is not yet at hand. Beware of Orc maidens!    "And I have something else to give you," she continued, "somethingthat might save your sword from breaking again." She smiled and handedhim a small silver key. Aragon blushed furiously, then a big smilecrept across his face. He bowed deeply and then beamed at Arwen whowinked back at him.    Galadriel then turned to the rest of the company. To Boromir she gave a Golden Warhorn of Summoning, and Morrie and Pipsqueak weregifted with a Silver Belt of Restoration each while Lego-lass receiveda Composite Elven Long Bow +3. Her granddaughter Arwen she presentedwith Winged Leather Boots of Speed.    Then she looked at Giggly. "And what gift would a Dwarf ask of theElves?" she asked.    "None," Giggly giggled, "for I already received more than I ever dared to hope."    "Hear all ye Elves!" Galadriel cried. "Let none ever say again that all Dwarves are grasping and ungracious... well, not ungracious, at least," she amended. "Nonetheless a gift you shall have," Galadriel said and handed him an autographed poster of herself (a VERY limited collectors' edition, only genuine with a strand of original hair of Galadriel interwoven into its fabric).    Giggly gasped, then started excitedly to jump up and down. "What joy,what joy. I shall take it with me always and when I come home to the Dwarvish Mines of Erebor at last, I shall encase this treasure in imperishable crystal and it shall be a heirloom of my house!"    Galadriel then turned to Sam. "I don't have much I can give you tohelp you serve your betters in this quest; and besides, it wouldn't beproper, of course. Only by exhausting themselves in the service oftheir masters can true servants show their worth, after all, andreceive praise. But I do have something that might help you ease thelife of your master after the quest is done." And she handed Sam asmall box. "In this box," she said, "is collected the essence of thetrees felled for constructing the famous Golf course of Lorien,bespoken with potent spells. When your master settles down in Nurnenafter this quest he may be missing the woods of the Shire. Then openthis box and spread its contents. There a forest will grow such as thedeforested shores of Nurnen have never seen before. Elvish forlorntrees will grow there, high and mighty, and no axe nor chainsaw mayfell them for the spells laid on the contents of this box protect themfrom any harm. Eternally they will stand on the shores of thebeautiful Lake Nurnen and your Master will enjoy taking a respite fromthe southern heat there while you faithfully toil in his service."Sam silently took the box and bowed as well as he could.    Finally, Galadriel turned to Frodo who was still smiling at theceiling. "And you, Ring-Bearer," she said, "I come to you last who arenot last in my thoughts. For you I have this," and she handed him asmall white stone. "This is an old heirloom of the Elves and came tous under mysterious circumstances from far away. It has waited here foryou since the beginning of time. It is a light imperishable that willshine for you in the dark when all other lights have gone out. But youmust name it first."    Frodo smiled at her. "Al'Tsahir," he said and the stone glowed brightly and leapt into his hand. "All the saws here," he corrected himself, "endlessly cutting trees of golden forlorn. Lights glowing brightly with neon colours of white. Pink slippers of glorious shine on wandering Santas of rosemarin..."    At the mention of The Clause all fell silent. The festive moodvanished. The spirit of the audience was broken. They dispersed andthe Company went to bed.    The next morning they were woken by Halfwit, Rummage and Orphan, the Elves who had first met them after they entered Lorien. They led them a last time through the fabled Golf course of Lorien and down to the Silverlode where three boats had been readied for the Company (tiedtogether with the fabled Elven rope, a distant ancestor of modernNylon). They were stocked with food and water, and contained an ElvenCloak of Near Invisibility for each of the Company. Pipsqueak at oncetried the food. "Hmm, crap," he said, "Good."    "Enough, enough," Halfwit laughed, "This is not crap. These are twinkies, which are a lot more nutritionally balanced than crap. You have already eaten more than you need in a whole day!"     The company then entered the boats. In one boat Aragon, Pipsqueak and Morrie climbed; the second one was taken up by Boromir, Lego-lass and Giggly. The third one (with the paddles) was manned by Arwen, Frodo and Sam, who took up the paddles.  They pushed off from theShore and the current at once swept them downriver.    As they drifted down the Silverlode and into the Great River they saw the last edge of Lorien, a tongue of land between the Silverlode andthe Great River, coming towards them. There the players clubhouse wassituated and out on the lawn a big picnic had been readied. Galadrieland Dullborn stood at a small pier waiting for them among a company ofbrightly garbed Elves and waved at them. But just as the current hadswept them almost past Galadriel and Dullborn and Sam started turningthe boats around and making toward the pier they felt a tingle, agolden flickering and suddenly time seemed to speed up. The currentof the River became a torrent. It swept them past the pier and downthe Great River. Before they could react they passed a bend in theRiver and Lorien was out of sight. Frodo passed out.    "Well," thought Sam, "so much to the good. At least I don't have to deal with those snobbish imperialist Elves again, and that's a fact.Giving me a box of FOREST ESSENCE for the delight of my MASTER." Heshook his head. The ruse with the autograph hadn't worked, but this...He smiled and took the box out of his pack. It was much lighter now.Well, he had made good use of its original contents. Let them try toplay golf in a dense forest of uncuttable trees, those greedycapitalists! After all, what did HE need forest essence for! No, hehad replaced this crap in the box with something far more useful...
  Frodo was roused by Sam, not that there's anything wrong with that.He awoke from a wistful dream of Galadriel's lament as their boats slowlydrifted out of Lorien.  Long afterwards he interpreted them, as well ashe could given Bilbo's somewhat fraudulent tutoring in Quenya:  "Eh! leeke-a guld fell zee leefes in zee veend, bork, lung yeersnoomberless es zee veengs ooff trees! Right On! De years gots' passedlikes swift draughts uh de sweet mead in lofty halls beyond da damn West,benead de blue vaults of Varda wherein de stars tremble in de song uh ha'voice, holy and queenly.

Now lost, mostly, lost to those from thuh Eastis like wow! Valimar!  Oh, wow!  Farewell!  Gag me with a SPOOOOON!Maybe thou shalt find Valimar!  Gag me with a pitchfork!  Maybe eventhou shalt find it.  Farewell!"  Frodo found that he was lying, wrapped from head to toe in all the spareelven cloaks, ropes, and forlorn leaf wrappings from the twinkies(or so he hoped) that Sam had collected from the Company's baggage.Looking up as he extricated himself from the swaddling, he noted thathe was under a large, grey-skinned tree that looked vaguely humanoid.Pipsqueak noticed this as well and tried to strike up a conversation,but no amount of prodding, poking, kicking, name-calling, or waving ofbrands from Giggly's little fire could get a response from it.  They started again shortly before noon, though Morrie would gladlyhave slept through lunch and tea-time.  Nor were most of the Company eager to hurry southwards, considering the crises of leadership and bitter recriminations (to say nothing of the heat and humidity) that lay beyond. Aragon let them drift with the stream as they wished, but stopped after the third time Boromir ran his boat aground with a strange, vicious glee.  But he insisted that they start earlier each day, for hisresentment of the Fellowship's defiance of his divine right after theescape from Moira still burned hot in his heart.  If I can't assail theDark Tower in glorious conquest as befits a returning king, he thought,I can still have a lot of fun running the stupid halflings straight intothe ground.  Nonetheless the hobbits held up surprisingly well, and they saw nosign of an enemy for two days.  The lands began to change slowly: firstthe trees thinned and became less ominously anthropomorphic.  On theeast bank, they say long slopes, grey and withered like the cirrhoticliver of one of the Big Folk who had spent far too many summer eveningsin the common room of the Prancing Pony.  They had come to the GreyLands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern Smirkwood and thehills of the Emyn Mail.  Aragon admitted, after much taunting by Arwen,and scowls and eyerolling by Boromir, that he had no clue what evil,horrible deed of the Enemy had so transformed the entire region.  Thehobbits noted with a mounting sense of horror that the hills far to thesouth seemed to be paved with a dark, matte substance and painted withwhite lines like the bones of some long-extinct fish.  There was no sign of living moving things, save birds.  Of these therewere many: annoying little ones, medium-sized ones that seemedpredestined to drop guano on the shoulders of the Men (who were littleconsoled when Lego-lass pointed out that being hit was a symbol ofgood fortune among the Elves of Smirkwood), and the hugest flyingcreatures they had yet seen.  Once or twice the travellers heard therush and whine of a sound like the shadow of the shape of wings, andlooking up they saw a familiar "V" shape streaming along the sky.  "Ai, ai!" cried Lego-lass.  "A B--... oh, never mind, they're ducks."  "Giant Arnorian mallards, by the looks of them," muttered Aragon."Now I understand.  What an evil fortune!  And I am already hungry!"  "How wide and commercialized all this country looks!" said Frodo.  "Ialways imagined that as one journeyed south, it got warmer andmerrier, with many retired people lounging about in the bright sun."  "But we have not journeyed far south yet," answered Aragon.  "It isstill winter, and we are far from the sea.  Far away down in theBay of Tampalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe,or would be merry but for the Tampalas Bay Corsairs.  But here we arenot above sixty leagues, I guess, south of the Southfarting away inyour Shire, hundreds of long miles to the east.  You are lookingnow southwest across the north plains of the Riddlemark, Rohan theland of the mysterious and eccentric Horse-lords.  Ere long we shallcome to the mouth of the Dimlight that runs down from Dolorn to jointhe Great River.  That is the north boundary of Rohan; and of old allthat lay between the Dimlight and the Off-White Mountains belonged to theRohirrim.  It is a rich and pleasant land, and its turfgrass has norival; you will find no golf courses for which it is harder or moreexpensive to get a tee time.  But in these evil days folk do not dwellby the River or ride often to its shores.  Anduin is wide, yetthe orcs get great range with those horn-backed composite bows andugly but functional orc fletching of theirs, so waterfront propertyvalues have understandably taken a dive.  Lately the orcs have evenstarted crossing the water and playing a few holes on the greens ofRohan."  Aragon shook his head ruefully as he visualized the Uruk-Haibeheading their hapless caddies.  "As for the commercialization, what you see here is but the beginning,not even a faint shadow of the great, magical kingdom that myancestors built."  At this cryptic comment, Aragon suddenly becameclose, as if he had said too much already, and not even Arwen couldget him to speak again for hours.  Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily.  The trees had seemed hostilebefore, but some of the isolated treelike figures on the shore werejumping up and down, giving him Bree cheers and making rude gestures.He had a feeling that the Company was completely exposed to any orcishsniper who could shoot a hobbit child's bow, meandering slowly inlittle open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, on a river thatwas the frontier of war, but then the feeling passed.  In the next day or two, the Company passed steadily southwards as theRiver broadened and gravel shoals formed.  These became so rough thatBoromir stopped running the boat aground and actually startedsteering intently.  The faintly drawn lines on the southernmost hillsof the Grey Lands began to resolve themselves into neat rectangles,a little over a tall Man's height across and twice as long.  Eachmember of the Company was busy with his or her own thoughts.  The heart of Lego-lass was running under the stars with some handsomeNoldorin lad in Lorien; Giggly was running his fingers through gold inhis mind (silken, flowing rivulets of gold), and also wondering what hewould use as the housing of the Lady's gift.  Morrie and Pipsqueak inthe middle boat were ill at ease as they watched Giggly in the followingboat, eyes shuttered, muttering and giggling to himself as he recalledsome strange memory.  Boromir was muttering as well, sometimesbiting his nails, sometimes grabbing a paddle and standing up in hisboat poised to deliver a resounding whack to the back of Frodo's head.Then Pipsqueak, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a suspiciouslook in Boromir's eye as he aimed the death blow.  But thenBoromir would shake his head and sit down, and Pipsqueak'ssuspicions passed.  Sam looked serene and peaceful, but was actuallylocked in a mortal struggle against his pathological phobia of boats.Ever since he had heard about Master Frodo's parents, he could notshake his obssessive, constant, driving fear of them.  It never ended,not for a single waking moment.   Even now a voice akin to the DarkLord's was resounding through his skull: "I'm in a boat, I'm in aboat..."  Neverending.  Never.  As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over thebowed heads of Frodo and Aragon and the following boats-boats-boats,boat-boat-I'm-in-a-boat, in-a-boat; he was on the verge of mentalcollapse and would have willingly killed the rest of the Company tofeel sweet earth under his toes.  Suddenly something caught his sight;at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and shook hishead violently to make the bad boat-thoughts go away; but when helooked again he could not see it any more.  That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank.Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo, shuddering and hoping thateyot wasn't an Elvish word for boat.  "I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo," he said.  "Or maybe it wasn't a dream.  Funny it was anyway."  "Well, what was it?  You need a better primer than that, Sam," saidFrodo, recalling that Sam had not had the same training in orationthat he had received from Bilbo, and bracing himself for a stalepunchline.  (In fact, Sam had had the benefit of the best educationin public speaking that a hobbit could get, sitting in The GreenDragon at Bywater.)  "It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo.  At first I thought I washallucinating, the way I do whenever I get near r-r-r-runningw-w-w-water.  But I swear I saw a log with eyes!"  "Oh, sure," said Frodo.  "That's just Gullible.  He's been followingus all the way through Moira and right down into Lorien.  He thinkshe's all sneaky and clever, but he's really as loud and clumsy as anoliphaunt in a mathom house.  Just play along and humor him.  Wecan grab him any time we want to, but he makes a good decoy for theorcs."  Aragon overheard this, but remained silent and feigned sleep, for hehad tried twice to catch Gullible in the middle of the night andfound him too sly and slippery.  There was no need to admit this tothe hobbits, of course.  The night passed without Gullible showing so much as a shadow again.After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but the Men and Gigglysaw no more of Gullible while the voyage lasted.  The hobbits,Lego-lass, and Arwen, on the other hand, caught sight of him everynow and then.  He was usually flailing along attached to amoss-eaten log or other piece of flotsam, trying desperately andridiculously to camouflage himself by daubing himself with rivermud.  The Company had adopted a don't-ask, don't-tell policyregarding the relative powers of observation of each member, sonothing was ever said.  Giggly and the Men could always pretend thatit was due to the cover of night that Gullible seemed invisible.In this way the time passed rather boringly until the seventh day.  The weather was still grey and overcast, and dim enough that theCompany could hardly tell the sky from the surrounding hills.  A windfrom the East parted the clouds and the young sliver of the Moonappeared.  As Sam was staring at its reflection, perplexed, he heardGullible sloshing horridly along the east bank, sneezing as thereeds tickled his nose and cursing under his breath (but still veryloudly) as he tripped and fell into the stream.  The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly.The banks began to rise and grow stony, and as the land slopedhigher, the paved grey hills in the distance vanished for a time fromthe Company's view.  More birds circled overhead, and as the Companywas getting under way for the evening, a wondrously loud cry causedall heads to snap upwards.  A great shape passed, high and far off,now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.  "What is that, Lego-lass?" Aragon asked, pointing to the northernsky.  "Is it, as I think, an eagle?"  "No," said Lego-lass.  "It is... uh..."  "What?"  "Never mind."  "WHAT IS IT, LEGO-LASS?"  "Well, it's hard to say, but I think the Dunedain call it a...mumak?"  "What?!  Who ever heard of FLYING mumakil?"  "Well, didn't you hear it trumpeting?"  And so the debate continued, with Arwen taking Lego-lass's part andBoromir joining Aragon in proclaiming the impossibility of whatthe Elves claimed to have spied from afar.  Finally Aragon tired ofthe argument (which, truth to tell, the Men were losing) and insistedthat it was fully dark and time for the Company to resume its trek.  The eighth night of their journey came, silent and windless.  "Come!"said Aragon.  "We will venture one more journey by night.  We arecoming to the reaches of the River that I do not know well; for Ihave never journeyed by water in these parts before, not betweenhere and the rapids of Sarn Eisner.  But if I am right in myreckoning, those are still many miles ahead, and I hear there are afew cheap eateries along the way, at least until we get there."  To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman, inaddition to his duties as squire, cook, washing boy, latrine digger,porter, second oarsman, and all-around lackey.  "From each accordingto his abilities..." he chanted stoically, as he stood at the head ofthe boat and tried to imagine that he was standing in the basementof Bag End.  The pale foam of the River lashed against sharp rocksthat were thrust far into the stream like a ridge of teeth, and Samand Morrie emptied their stomachs into the swirling waters for thethird time that night.  Morrie wistfully noted that they had hadonly ONE dinner to throw up.  "Please remain seated at all times,"intoned Aragon, in a strange voice.  "Hoy there, Aragon!" shouted Boromir, as his boat lurched upand down, smashing into the leader but curiously not movinglaterally.  "This is madness!  We cannot ride the Rapids by night!But no boat can live in Sarn Eisner, be it night or day."  "Back, back!" cried Aragon.  "Turn!  Turn if you can!"  He drovehis paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring itround.  The boats seemed completely unable to turn, but Aragon,Sam, Boromir, Lego-lass, and Arwen were able to push themback up the river with strenuous rowing.  "I am out of my reckoning," whispered Aragon to Frodo.  "I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought.Sarn Eisner must be close at hand already."  "You're a little out of shape, too," noted Frodo, hearing theragged panting in Aragon's voice.  As the boats slowly inched back up the river and came to a complete stop, Frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone.  At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrowswhistled overhead, and some fell among them.  One smote Frodo between the shoulders, about halfway between the Morgul-knife scarin front and the orc-spear wound on his side.  Frodo felt like ahobbit-kebab as he lurched forward with a cry, sure that he wasgoing to get tetanus from that cursed suit of mithril mail thistime.  A second arrow passed through Lego-lass's hair, butfortunately the huge hairdo she had acquired in Lorien had confusedthe archer.  A third arrow stood fast in the gunwale of the secondboat, close by Morrie's hand.  "Please keep your hands inside theboat at all times," suggested Aragon helpfully.  "Yrch!" said Lego-lass.  "Did that arrow get you?" cried Giggly.  "No, orcs!" she replied.  Now that Lego-lass had pointed them out, Sam thought he couldglimpse orcs in crude camouflage running to and fro upon the longshingle-banks that lay under the eastern shore.  They were all dressedas shrubberies.  Strangely enough, there were no other shrubs of anykind on the banks.  "That idiot Gullible!  Look at him trying to hide behind that orc,"said Sam to Frodo.  Suddenly a black-feathered arrow sprouted from the torso of the orc in question and he fell over, revealing a quivering dark shape, nearly unclothed and crouched low, who scrambled into the rocks.  "Well, in this case, it seems to have worked," remarked Frodo wryly.  Sam leaned foward, straining at the paddles, as the boats continuedto move backwards in a straight line, one against another.  Even therest of the Company took a hand now that real danger was imminent.Every moment they expected to take an arrow through the eye.  Aragonwas especially anxious about this as it had actually happened to hisfather while he was "on errantry" with Arwen's brothers, or so theysaid.  Many projectiles whined overhead or struck the water nearby;but there were no more hits.  As it turned out, elven cloaks andgrey boats were very good camouflage in the Grey Lands, much betterthan shrubberies.  Stroke by stroke they labored on.  In the darkness, it was hard totell that they were indeed moving at all (in fact, they were movingmuch slower upstream than the orcs, who had far overestimated theCompany's rowing ability and completely lost track of them, evenwith their night-eyes).  At last, as far as they could judge, theyhad broken free of the rapids and were able to gradually rowtowards the western shore.  Under the shadow of the bushes leaningout over the water they halted and waited while Sam, who had donemost of the rowing while the boats were jammed together, caughthis breath and tried not to cough up a lung.  Lego-lass laid down her paddle and took up the +3 bow that she hadbrought from Lorien.  Then she sprang ashore and climbed a littleway up the bank.  Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow she turned,peering back over the river into the darkness.  Across the waterthere were some whistles and catcalls, but nothing could be seen.Lego-lass turned away, sorry that she had not found a target to aimat but a little relieved that she could not see the orcs whistlingat her, either.  But now great clouds advanced from the South,obscuring sections of the starry fields.  The Company suddenly felta fear of the dark much like Sam's fear of the river.  "Elbereth Gilthoniel!" sighed Lego-lass as she looked up.  Evenas she did so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, forit moved far more swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the Company, blotting out all light as itapproached.  Soon it appeared as a great winged creature, blackerthan the pits in the night.  Fierce voices rose up to greet itfrom across the water.  Frodo felt a sudden recognition runningthrough him and the memory of an old, old fear.  He crouched down,as if to hide.  Suddenly the great bow of Lorien sang.  It gave a rather marginalrendition of Laer Cu Beleg (the Song of the Great Bow), as the bowwas accustomed to singing duets with its archer and was simply not agood soloist.  Frodo looked up just as the song reached a crescendo.Almost above him the winged shape swerved.  There was a harshcroaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down into thegloom of the eastern shore. The sky was empty again.  There was atumult of many voices far away, scattered curses, shouts, and wailingin the darkness, and then silence.  Neither shaft nor cry came againfrom the east that night.  After a while Aragon led the boats back upstream.  They felt theirway along the water's edge to a small shallow bay where they awaitedthe dawn.  A thin smoke wafted down from the east, borne by a verylight wind.  "Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand-eye coordination ofLego-lass!" said Giggly, as he munched a twinkie.  He marveled atthe tensile strength of elf hair.  "That was a mighty shot in thedark, my friend!"  Even Arwen could not suppress a hearty "you go,girl!" but the Men looked away, embarassed.  "But who can say what it hit?" said Lego-lass.  "I cannot," said Giggly.  "But you were right to shoot first andask questions later.  I am glad that the shadow came no nearer.  Toomuch it reminded me of the shadow in Moira - the shadow of theBalrog," he ended in a whisper.  "It was not a Balrog," said Frodo, still shivering with a strangesense of foreboding.  "I think it was - "  Then he paused and fellsilent.  "What do you think?" asked Boromir eagerly, seeming to catchFrodo's meaning.  "I think - no, I will not say," answered Frodo.  "Whatever it was,its fall has thrown our enemies into disarray."  "So it seems," said Aragon, his face still red.  He could not lookLego-lass or Arwen in the eye.  "But what the day will show who cantell?  Have your weapons close to hand!"  With this he heftedEndurit and flexed his biceps ostentatiously.  Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword with a dumbfounded look, andlooking up at the sky.  No one noticed this, of course, but at lengthhe murmured, "It's very strange.  The Moon's the same in the Shireand in Wilderland, but it seems to be running slower.  You'll remember,Mister Frodo, that it was waning as we lay up in that tree; a weekfrom the full, I reckon.  And we'd been a week out of Lorien when uppops a New Moon thin as an anorexic barrow wight.  Anyone would thinkthat time did not count in the Elvish country!"  Lego-lass and Frodo, hearing a now-familiar sloshing from the eastbank, exchanged significant looks.  "Perhaps that was the way of it,"said Frodo, too loudly for Sam's liking.  "In that land, maybe, wewere in a time that has elsewhere long gone by - ISN'T THAT RIGHT,LEGO-LASS?" he ended almost in a shout.  "QUITE SO, Frodo," answered Lego-lass.  "Time tarries in fair Loth-lorien, so that those who dwell at its heart do not age at all, even as centuries pass in the surrounding lands.  Why, we were probably inthere six or seven hundred years!  How many generations of Bagginses have grown and gone in the Shire, do you think?"  Suddenly from a shadowed alcove on the bank there was a gasp, a strangled cry that turned into a hoarse wailing, and then a steady muted slamming as if of a soft object on a rock.  Frodo mused, "The wearing of time must be slowed by the power of theLady.  Rich are the hours in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wieldsthe Elven-ring."  "SHHHH!" hissed Arwen sotto voce.  "Grandma's really sensitive abouther jewelry.  See that Elfstone she gave Aragon?  That's a commonsemiprecious stone, a copper a dozen in Rivendell.  She says that ifhe expects to ever wear the real emerald, he'd better show hedeserves it."  Her voice sounded none too confident to Frodo.  The night passed silently.  No sloshing or head-banging was heardagain from the water.  The travellers huddled in their boats feltthe weather getting warmer and moister as the River took them towardsthe still-distant sea.  The rushing of the rapids grew louder as thethe Company was tested and found wanting in whitewater skills.  Awhite fog swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen.  "I can't abide fog," said Sam, "but maybe it will hide us from thosecursed goblins."  "Orcs, you mean?" queried Morrie.  "Same difference," snapped Frodo quickly.  "What IS the difference?  Old Bilbo never did explain---" yammered Pipsqueak.  "Enough, you silly hobbits!" cried Boromir.  "Where in Middle-earthwould anyone find petty nitpickers such as you?!"  "Quiet, all of you!" interjected Aragon.  "I'm trying to chart ourcourse past Sarn Eisner and down to the Emyn Mail."  Boromir said, "If we are almost at the Emyn Mail, I do not seewhy we cannot just abandon these boats---"  "YES! YES!  OH, SWEET ELBERETH, YES!  WOO-HOO!" screamed Sam.  "We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith," countered Aragon,"but that is not yet agreed.  And such a course may be more perilousthan it sounds.  The vale of Mentwash is flat and fenny, and Samwould have a hard time lugging nine packs through it on foot.I would not abandon our boats until we must.  The River is at leasta path that cannot be missed."  Sam looked as if he would willingly carry the Company's baggage allthe way to Mount Viagra to be rid of the boats now.  In truth, hewas seriously entertaining the notion of borrowing the Ring the nexttime Frodo was asleep.  Surely Master Frodo would not notice itsabsence for the short minute it would take to "convince" Aragon tohack the boats to pieces with Endurit or do away with them himself.  "But the Enemy holds the eastern bank," objected Boromir."And even if you pass the Gates of Argonath and are admitted to theother side, what will you do then?  Leap down the Falls and land inthe marshes?"  "Hah!  Shows how much YOU know!" answered Aragon.  "If you were ascompetent a leader as I am, you would have Sam bear our boats by theancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again."(Hurin making his last stand at the Fen of Screech could not havelooked more fell than Sam did at this moment.)  "Did you not know,Boromir, or do you choose to forget about the North Stair, andthe high seat upon Momin Hen, that were made in the days of thegreat kings?  Huh?  Didya?"  After some browbeating Boromir admitted that he had heard ofMomin Hen and the North Stair, but that they had slipped his mind inhis hurry to get back to his home city before it was razed by ahundred thousand Mordor orcs.  "It is not the way of the Men ofMinas Tirith to desert their friends at need," he said, "and youwill need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock.  Tothe tall isle I will go, but no further.  There I shall turn to myhome, alone if my help has not earned the reward of anycompanionship."  At this Boromir turned a puppy dog gaze oneach member of the Company in turn.  Even Lego-lass was moved bythe sheer pathos of his expression.  Millenia of stewardship and allthe courtly brown-nosing skill that they entailed were not lost onBoromir.  Aragon was left with a hefty guilt trip, but beingengaged to Arwen for over thirty years had taught him how to shakethose off quickly.  The fog lifted as the day grew and Aragon and Lego-lass preparedto go scouting ahead.  Aragon hoped to find a short-cut.  "Boatsof the Elves might not sink," he said, "but that does not say thatwe should come through Sarn Eisner with a penny to our names.  Nonehave done so yet."  "Well, it was nice knowing you, Aragon," smirked Boromir.  Theexpenses of this land were enumerated in many a tale told tofrighten Gondorian children, princes being no exception.  "Wait for one week," said Aragon.  "If we do not return in thattime, then you will know that evil has indeed befallen us (or thatwe have found a REALLY good dinner buffet).  Then you must take anew leader and follow her as you will."  Arwen had been looking atrifle jealous and Aragon hoped that this would mollify her.  As Frodo saw Aragon and Lego-lass climb the steep bank and vanishinto the mists, he had a feeling that they weren't coming back.Little did he know that the rest of the Company was thinkinglikewise; but all their fears proved groundless.  In less thanhalf a day, Aragon and Lego-lass came staggering back, lookingwell-fed.  "All is well," said Aragon, as he clambered down the bank.  "Notonly is there a track, but there is a whole strip of inexpensivefast food joints only an hour's hike downstream.  There is nobuffet, but all manner of diners are there.  There is even a littlefruit stand if you fancy a bit of dessert."  As promised, Sam was laden with a boat, though Giggly and Boromirmagnanimously carried the packs.  In two trips the Company wasable to bring both the goods and the boats along the portage-wayto the cheap dining district that Aragon had mentioned.  Gigglywas at first disappointed that there were really only four veryshoddy-looking shacks, but suddenly his eyes brightened.  A signin the back of the food court read:                     DURIN'S LAST STAND                      OVER 140 SERVED"Surely this is a franchise of the hamburger chain founded by ourancient forefather, perhaps the only remaining one in Middle-earth,or at least on this side of the Misty Mountains!"  The proprietor, an aged Dwarf, came hobbling out.  Giggly and thehobbits, not having tasted fast food for months, were most eagerto place their orders, and Frodo ordered an extra 6-piece box ofchicken nuggets.  The Dwarf swore that his special sauce was handeddown from Mahal himself, "or my name's not Max Goldstein."  "Your name is Max Goldstein?" piped Pipsqueak.  "What of it?" said Max.  "I am a Dwarf.  If you prick us, do wenot bleed?"  "Hey, where's my pound-o-flesh burger?" shouted Boromir.  Max was unfazed.  "If you tickle us, do we not laugh?"  He tickledGiggly for emphasis and was rewarded with a long giggling fit.  "Ifyou poison us, do we not turn to stone?" he continued.  "Actually, they say that's an old wives' tale..." started Giggly, but Max continued.  "And if you wrong us, do we not hold a helluva grudge?"  Lego-lass laughed, "Aye, that you do!"; but Max laughed in returnand called to his assistant, a Dwarvish boy who struck up a livelytune as Max started dancing with the Elves.  As Max's other assistant served the Men, Arwen declined to order,citing a need to watch her weight.  She and Lego-lass walked tothe other side of the food court, where a very run-down hut satnext to the river.  The lettering was nearly worn off in severalplaces on the sign:                PEDRO'S MELONS AND MINNOWS                   FRESH FRUIT AND BAITThe Elves went in.  From behind the counter stepped a thin Elf whointroduced himself as Pedro.  "You ladies have no idea how hard itis to get business in these parts," he sighed.  "Maybe you should advertise," suggested Lego-lass.  "Are you kidding?  I've advertised from here to the Eregion gateof Moira, but it's had no effect."  "Really?  We just came from Moira."  "And you didn't see my ads?  I should have known.  They've probablyworn thin after all these years.  I haven't had time to go back andtouch them up, you know."  Arwen had a small ambrosia salad and Lego-lass ordered half of acantaloupe.  The two of them wished Pedro improved luck and startedback to rejoin the Company.  Suddenly Arwen caught something out of the corner of her eye.  "Comeon, Lego-lass!" she cried.  "I decided to get a nonfat Elvish latteat Max's..."  Suddenly she grabbed Lego-lass's hand and started torun.  Lego-lass though this passing strange, but was distracted asshe almost tripped over Pedro's nephew playing in the street, undera small sign whose post was formed from the shaft of a single Elvisharrow of apparent Lorien manufacture.  The point of the arrow wasjammed into a smoking cart around which several orcs were busilysetting up, and upon which others in aprons were busily carving withtheir scimitars while shoving each other around.  From the top of thesign extended a very large feather.   Arwen shot a glance backward:                    BAR-B-Q EEGIL BURGURSShe shook her head sadly and pulled harder on Lego-lass's hand.  Back at Durin's Last Stand, Max was still dancing.  He had formed aline with both of his assistants and they were performing a dance thatthe hobbits had last seen in the Old Forest.  When they finished, theCompany applauded politely.  Max explained that he had learned thedance from a traveling troupe that had recently passed through theGrey Lands on its way to a nine-city tour of Gondor.  He showed aflier for the troupe to the travellers:                 TOM BOMBADIL'S RIVERPRANCE           Coming soon to a mannish citadel near you!"I've been advertising for them with these fliers, but it's so hardto distribute them that I'm afraid I'm not much help," said Max.  "Why don't you just use Eagles?" suggested Boromir.  "They could,well, fly them for you."  "I had the same idea, and finally hired an air courier through theEmyn Mail Post Office last month, but he never came back from thisweek's delivery.  I wonder why..."  Arwen bent low and whispered something to Frodo that made him blanch."I feared it was so," was all he said, and Lego-lass could not gethim to explain further.  Soon it began to rain, as the Company sat under one of Max's awningsand nodded off one by one.  Slowly the sky above grew lighter andthe clouds parted to reveal the black, paved hills of Emyn Mail,closer than ever.  The next morning the travellers bade farewell toMax and launched their boats into a wide ravine.  Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching:like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed.  Tall and sheerand ominous they stood upon either side of the stream.  A narrow gapappeared between them, and the River swept the boats towards it.  "Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings!" cried Aragon.  "Weshall pass them soon.  Keep the boats in line, and as far apart asyou can.  As always, please remain seated and keep hands and feetinside the boats at all times."  As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers tomeet him.  Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent butstrangely reassuring.  Then he saw that they were indeed shaped andfashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon them, andthey were frozen in perpetual welcoming postures.  Upon greatpedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone:still with joyful expressions they smiled upon the North.  The lefthand of each was raised palm outwards as if waving to an adoringcrowd; in each right hand there was a sack, brimming with gold.  Greatpower and majesty they still wore, the silent wardens of an ancientkingdom.  Awe fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyesas the realization dawned that no inheritance could ever match thewealth and grandeur of these kings.  Even Boromir bowed as theboats chugged by, frail and fleeting as little leaves, under theenduring shadow of the sentinels of Numenor.  So they passed underthe dark chasm of the Gates.  Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs on either side.  The black watersroared as Sam shrieked to wake dead and undead alike, called forhis mommy, and finally seemed to channel the spirit of BrandobasTook as he roared a challenge to the Nazdaq.  Frodo was convincedthat he had gone quite completely mental.  "Fear not!" said a strange voice behind him.  Frodo turned and sawStrider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was garbednow as a Tour Guide.  In the stern sat Aragon son of Arathon, proudand fun-loving, guiding the boat with skillful strokes; his hoodwas cast back, and his dark hair was blowing in the wind, a lightwas in his eyes: a king returning from exile to his own land.  "Fear not!" he repeated for dramatic effect.  "Long have I desiredto look upon the likenesses of Elendil and Anarchion, my sires ofold.  Under their shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathon sonof Aradud of the House of Wupdidu Elendil's son, heir of Isildur,scion of the lords of Andunie..." - and in this fashion hecontinued rambling on through his pedigree for the better part ofan hour - "... has nothing to fear!"  Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: "Wherewas I?  Oh, a quest to destroy the One Ring and overthrow Sauron.Right."  Frodo looked up.  "Is Elendil dressed like a... a giant rat?" heasked.  "And the other one looks like some sort of... bad-temperedwaterfowl!" Morrie added. "What kind of outfit is that?"  "Sssssshhh!" snapped Boromir. "Show some respect!"  "Anarchion is depicted in the garb of the Sea-Kings," said Lego-lass.  "... but he's got no pa--" began Pipsqueak.  "RESPECT, dammit!" shouted Aragon, losing his kingly image for abrief moment.  The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind andrushing water and echoing stone.  It bent somewhat towards the west,but gradually a gap of light drew near and the boats shot throughinto a long oval lake.  Pale Nen Inenibubu, fenced by steep greyhills whose sides were clad with trees, gleamed in the afternoonlight.  "Behold Tol Brandir!" said Aragon, pointing south to the tall peak."Upon the left stands Momin Lhaw, and upon the right is Momin Hen,the Hills of the Shrew and the Chicken.  In the days of the greatkings there were high seats upon them, and watch was kept there.Tol Brandir has a nice ride inside it, which I highly recommend ifwe get a chance to come back for a longer visit, but there's notenough time to get through the line now.  And listen!  I hear theendless voice of Riproaros calling."  The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the currentthat flowed through the middle of the lake.  They ate some Easterlingtake-out from the stand between Max's and Pedro's.  Frodo's fortunecookie read: You will soon take a cruise with an old friend.The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grewred and slowly sank as they drifted.  By nightfall, they had reachedthe shadow of the dreaded paved hills.  The tenth day of their journey was over.  Wilderland was behind them.They could go no further without choice between the east-way andthe west.  The last stage of the Quest was before them.  "Everyone remember where we parked," said Aragon.
     Aragon, after ordering Sam to hide their boats in the brush alongside the river, and also mentioning that building a small trailer for each of the boats would greatly increase their resale value, led the party a short distance inland. Near the feet of Momen Hen they found a small glade of green grass among the bushes, with a picnic table carved with countless initials and an overthrown bucket of trash thoughtfully marked ISILDUR SAYS PLEASE DO NOT LITTER!     "Here we will rest for now," Aragon said with undue solemnity. "Though it worries me to see that the trash collections are off. Saddened I am to see Momen Llaw and Momen Hen in disrepair! Once, long ago, they were well-known, and income-producing."     "Not exciting enough in these modern times," Boromir said simply.     The others filed in and lay down upon the green, and so relaxed and chatted idly about the weather while Sam made their camp, muttering quiet epithets to himself. After a time Frodo stepped aside and talked to Aragon. "Is this place safe?" he asked. "I feel a certain foreboding. Though it might just be that Sam's grumblings about the idle rich being put to slow death on a roasting spit are beginning to annoy me."     "I do not know," Aragon replied. "Though a shadow has been on my heart, and a rock in my boot, ever since we arrived. A watch we will set tonight. Tell Sam to take care of it."     "Er, well, I'm not sure that would make me sleep much better," Frodo replied. Sam was sitting off to one side by his cook-pots, sharpening a huge carving-knife and looking at him threateningly. Frodo put a hand over his throat and tried to imagine sleeping with Sam as his guard. "Mmmmmmaybe Sam should, er, have the night off, or we can inject him with tranquilizers or something."     "Okay, you'll keep the watch instead," Aragon replied abruptly.     Frodo blinked, and before he could answer the tall Ranger stood and walked over to Arwen, who said something under her breath about Frodo and laughed. Pipsqueak sat off to one side, asking of Morrie yet again who it was who had pushed him into the well in Moira; and Morrie gave another of his wide, honest, innocent gestures of ignorance. Giggly and Lego-lass stood several feet away arguing heatedly, at first about long-held Elvish and Dwarvish grudges, then about the differences between the sexes, and eventually about the virtues of single parenting. Their voices rose to a fierce crescendo, and they leaned in so closely to shout at one another that almost Frodo thought they were going to stop suddenly and kiss. Boromir, in contrast, sat silently at the picnic-table, idly carving the initials B into the tabletop with his sword, his unseeing eyes focused on some bitter deep internal turmoil. Eventually the initials were carved completely through the table; and Boromir continued, inexorably, carving his way onwards into the ground. Frodo refused to look in Sam's direction, though he could feel Sam's eyes boring into his back like twin steel drill-augers, and heard the quiet mutterings behind him grow gradually more menacing as Sam's dialect grew ever more threatening and impenetrable.     "Keep the watch!" he said quietly to himself. "Were I surrounded by ten thousand Orcs, and a thousand Balrogs or three, I think I would find sleep easier."     Midnight came. The growing Moon passed its zenith and began its slow course towards Valhalla. Frodo looked over his companions. The Fellowship slept fitfully, each waking at whiles to check their pockets for valued possessions before drowsing to sleep again. Arwen and Lego-lass sat quietly in Elf-fashion, not in sleep but in the half-asleep, half-awake, three-quarters real, one-third dream, two-fifths waking daydream, one-over-Pi waking daydream sleeping nightmare idling random thought which the Elves take in place of sleep. At length Arwen stood. "Excuse me," she said quietly, "I've got to go see a man about a wolverine, or something." She straightened her black leathers, adjusted her shuriken and throwing-knives, and stepped into the night.     Her black, thigh-high leather boots squeaking quietly through the underbrush, Arwen made her way stealthily to the riverbank, where she crouched near the boats, checked her weapons yet again, and waited. Her Elvish eyes scanned the darkness, while her mind raced. I'm here! she thought proudly. I've made it into the movie for sure now. No getting rid of me! No way I'm going to sit around at Dad's, writing poetry and knitting ugly banners while all the action's going on down here. But I'm not taking any chances. Not even one. In this manner her thoughts ran wildly through the long-secluded corridors of her mind, until at length she heard the splashing of icky little feet just upstream. She went still. A slipblade dropped silently down her wrist and into the curve of her right hand. She held her breath and waited.     A webbed hand, pale and slimy in the fading moonlight, reached from the water and grabbed the blunt end of one of the boats. A pair of luminous green eyes rose up behind it, and suddenly an ugly wet slimy horrible pathetic little fish-eating geek splashed out of the river and flopped squeaking into the boat. "Ick! Ick! Icky icky ick! Ssssss!" hissed the creature. "Musst search backpacks. Musst feel for secret compartments. Musst work on mastering tricksy idiosyncratic dialect. Yesss! Yesss, pringles. Yesss- urrk," the figure added, as Arwen grabbed it by the head with her left hand and flashed the slipknife up to the creature's throatwith her right.     "Listen to me, Gulible, or Gullible, or however the hell it is you spell your name," Arwen hissed in a quiet whisper. "I need your help."     "Ach! Ssssss! Nassty Elven bitch! Sets us up, it doess. Stoods us up, humiliates uss, yesss, saddam! Dinner reservations we hads, yesss; flowerses, nice gowns it boughts for you in Moira-land. Even Orcs who play the violin we finds, yesss! But it stoods us up; it humiliates us; it leaves us with a hell of a minimum to drink up! Complete personality change it has wreaked, saddam, in convenience to plot, fortunately. Poor Gulllible! Tricksy Elven sstrumpet! Nassty sweet-talking tight-fisted leatherbound harlot! Guliblle will help you not. Voice lessons have I taken from Yoda."     "Find the Orcs," Arwen continued, pressing gently on the air supply to the creature's lungs. "Tell them where we are. Tell them to attack the Fellowship exactly as the Sun reaches noon. You got that? Exactly at noon! Do that, and I'll make up for Moira. Fail, and you'll be here for dinner the next time I see you. As the main course. Got that?"     "Ssssss! Nasssty crawdad! Wench! Think about it I will. Let me go! Give me libertine or give me death!" Gulible flapped its paws pathetically, fear and hatred fighting lust, and all three fighting common sense, which was in somewhat short supply at the moment. Arwen looked hard and searchingly into the creature's eyes, then released her grip. Gulible flapped about ludicrously and flopped over into the water with a splash, and immediately began retreating, muttering something unintelligible about the treachery of Emma Peel.     Arwen looked after him in satisfaction. Arwen Saves The Day! the headlines rang in her mind. Some Orcs would attack, and then she would arrive heroically and singlehandedly drive them off. So simple! Strong-willed daughter of Elvenhome saves heir of Elendil, and Ring-quest! Surprise Orc-ambush driven back by fierce counterattack from beautiful and mighty Elven-princess! Glossy pictures in magazines and "Arwen the Morningstar" fan-clubs were soon to replace her current bleak future of appendices and the occasional scholarly comment about her geneaology. A major part in the movie would certainly be hers after this! She adjusted her tight leather tunic, checked her spring-darts and tasteful belt-flail, and made her way back quietly to the sleeping camp.     Red dawn rose from the East, and the wind carried a smell of burning leaves and fiery marshmallows. Above them Tol Brandir stood, proud but rundown, a once-mighty mountain now waiting for a redesign and new weather-resistant siding. Momin Hen stood oily and desolate next to them, a great attraction in years gone past, now dusty and forlorn. Across the River Frodo could catch the rays of dawn alighting upon Momin Lhaw, and was saddened to think of that high place of the Atlanteans now held by the Enemy and used as a third-rate Orc casino.     Sam prepared breakfast, and the Fellowship ate it in silence. Frodo even decided not to comment on the razor blade Sam had placed in his eggs. After they had finished, and Sam had completed the washing up, Aragon called everyone together to discuss the Quest.     "The day has finally come," he began, "when we have to decide, once and for all, what the hell it is we're supposed to do next. Gandalf, El Rond and Galadriel all thought it incredibly important that we speed directly to Mount Viagra and destroy the Ring without delay. Of course, none of them are here to actually help or anything, but that's what they thought we ought to do for them. Boromir, of course, wants to return to his native land-"     "What time is it?" Arwen suddenly cut in, oblivious to the conversation. She was sitting quietly off to one side intently oiling and polishing her weapons.     "Hm? Oh, uh..." Aragon answered, taken off-guard. He gazed at the sun and the shadows. "Oh, about ten-thirty, I think. So, Boromir wants to-"     "Are you sure?" Arwen cut in again.     "Yes," Aragon answered, somewhat less calmly, "I'm sure." After a pause he continued. "Boromir wants to return to his native land, the Magic Kingdom of Gondor, and the great City of Minas Tirith, which has long stood as a place of Magic and Wonder. I, of course, want to go there and claim my rightful Kingship to it and subjugate it to my will and put Boromir out of a job. Though I'm sure we'll find something else for you, Boromir," he added hastily. "Maybe an associate vice-president in charge of production, or something. Anyway, there is also this subpoena from Isengard to deal with, written in Aruman's own hand."     "It looks a lot like Gandalf's handwriting to me," Pipsqueak cut in obnoxiously.     "Yes, well, you know, wizards' handwriting all looks the same," Aragon replied, looking quickly at the document. "Anyway, we must now decide which of these three causes we shall take up first. I suggest we now all go directly to the fastness of Minas Tirith, and there take counsel and supplies and thirty or forty thousand of my heavily-armed subjects to aid us in our other missions East and West."     "Sounds good to me," Lego-lass replied.     "Me too," chorused Morrie and Pipsqueak together.     "I liked it the last time I was there," Arwen added, looking up briefly from her toe-spikes. "'Corsairs of the Tampalas' was fun."     "From that great fastness we may strike a mighty blow against the Scum-lords of the East," Boromir agreed heartily. "Along with other traitors," he added darkly, his eyes boring into Frodo's back.     "We Dwerrows have long held the long-standing and proper opinion that Gondor is a gruesome, dishonorable hell-pit of leeches and vipers," Giggly stated. "But if we're stuck with having to go visit Mordor and Aruman as well, I admit I wouldn't mind having a few divisions of armoured cutthroats and vicious attorneys handy to back us up."     "Nobody cares what I think anyway," Sam said sullenly.     "Well, then, it's settled," Aragon rejoiced. "We're going to Gondorland!"     "Well, but, uh-" Frodo began.     Aragon stopped and stared at the puny Hobbit. Legions of his future subjects were awaiting his holy edict; yet here was Frodo, delaying him. "Yes?" he demanded.     "Well, you see, I still have an estate in Mordor to claim! Sir Frodo Baggins of Nurnenshire, remember? My own little estate by the lake, with lots of vast hemp fields, and legions of cowed slaves to tend them? Nobility? Respectability? A title? Cucumber sandwiches, and one of those big long robes? You think I came along on this stupid useless low-budget shark-infested holiday because Gandalf had some chores to take care of? No, we need to go straight to Mordor! I suppose I can do something about the Ring once I get established, if you think it's important. I'll have Sam take it to the Fires of Doom once he's got my luggage rounded up. And yes, Sam, I'll even give you a raise for that. And one more hour of unpaid time off per week," he said, glancing round for his servant. Not finding him, however, he paused then plunged ahead. "Well, maybe skip the raise, then," he continued. "But Mordor calls me, and there I must go. Minas Tirith will still be there for you after I've claimed my estate. Probably, anyway."     "But everyone else has voted to go to Gondor," Aragon insisted. "We outvote you, so it's decided." Democracy was, after all, still a useful tool until he actually became a monarch.     "But I have to go to Mordor!" Frodo answered.     Seeing the glares he was getting from the rest of the Company, Frodo relented somewhat. "Well, okay," he agreed sullenly. "Just, uh, I, I just need a few minutes to think about it, is all."     Aragon nodded. "Just be back here by noon," he replied. "Arwen's been very insistent about leaving just past noon."     The meeting ended. Deeply annoyed, Frodo began wandering upwards along the path to the top of Momin Hen. Maybe things will look less bleak from higher up, he thought. Unnoticed by the others Boromir rose, his soul carrying enough bleak to cover four or five epic novels, and began ascending the path behind him. The others resumed their various arguments and obsessions from the day before, creatures of habit which they were.     Arwen checked the angle of the sun once more. With another quick adjustment of the poison dart compartment at her breast, she strode back into the wilderness. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty paces. Nicely inconspicuous. Room for a running start. But enough? She increased it to fifty paces. Okay, be fair, sixty. Had to have the advantage of surprise, after all. A nice, round seventy-five paces would be perfect. She and the Fellowship could no longer see each other at all through the brush. Good, good! Complete advantage of surprise. She slipped on her spiked platinum knuckles, tied her hair back to increase visibility, released it again to increase desirability, and waited. Noon. She was impatient, but she forced herself to wait. After waiting two thousand years for a heroic opportunity like this, she could wait another hour and fifteen minutes.     Gondor! Frodo stomped his way along the path leading up Momin Hen, hands clenched into fists, occasionally uprooting delicate flowers or throwing rocks at small animals in his fury. Gondor! Stupid useless little kingdom on the edge of being obliterated, populated by big clumsy Men who thought trademarks were a sign of nobility. Frodo was obviously more noble and genteel than the lot of that commercial money-grubbing rabble, that was certain. And now they wanted him to set aside his Eru-granted rights, his clear and unquestioned claims to nobility, his big castle and army of paycheck-free agricultural workers, and further delay the manifest destiny he obviously deserved! Oh, sure, the legalese of El Rond demanded that he destroy the Ring before he could claim his Estate; but that was just a petty legal detail. The good offices of Sauron would certainly take care of that minor technicality. Just like El Rond to needlessly complicate everything, the bloated million-year-old dolt. With these thoughts Frodo made his way to the peak of Momin Hen, where he stepped up to the observation platform. A plaque next to the railing, long ago damaged by weather and the graffiti of ancient tourists, could just be made out, though Frodo could not understand the forgotten language:      SCYNIC VYEW      Myghty Gyndor strytches yut byfore yyu.

After a moment, however, the ancient dust gave way, and Frodo found himself able to see remarkable distances. Facing West he looked upon the green fields of Edoras, where many horses ran, with Men riding them - great tall Men with golden hair and a look which was, even to Frodo's untrained eyes, clearly and unmistakably Anglo-Saxon in every regard, pre-Normanic, possibly Mercian though it was hard to tell from this distance, though rather inexplicably they all seemed to be wearing kilts, and occasionally throwing a Frisbee. At the very foot of the Musty Mountains Frodo could just make out a tower of shimmering white, surrounded by a splendid garden of great beauty and ringed with a wall of beautiful, translucent marble. Obviously the tower of the evil heinous wizard traitor Aruman. Frodo quickly hurried on.     Frodo's gaze quickly turned North. Following the line of the Mountains he came to the three high peaks which crowned Moira. For a fleeting moment he thought he had seen an old man in white sitting in a lounge chair beside an old man in red, drinking cocktails and laughing at some unheard joke; but the vision passed, and he realized that looking North was making him really jittery for some reason. He wheeled around once more to face the South.     He saw the Sea. He saw the Off-White Mountains, proud, cold and pointy. His gaze picked out Minas Tirith, and he looked upon it in amaze: a beautiful city, clean and immaculate, surrounded by seven walls of stone and surmounted by a castle with tall narrow spires of storybook beauty, where Frodo could just make out large numbers of people standing in incredibly long lines trying to look like they were still excited about whatever the hell it was they were waiting such unbelievable lengths of time for. Many of them carried souvenirs. A surprising number of them seemed to be wearing round black helms with mysterious protrusions, like Boromir's. Every single one of them looked like they had spent too much money. Frodo was about to turn away when he saw - or thought he saw; it must have been a mistake, it must have been - some sort of giant rat walking through the avenues, waving at the people; who did not scream or run away, as sensible people would, from a grinning six-foot-tall rodent. Frodo blinked. It couldn't have been. Perhaps it was just a reflection, or something.     Saving the best for last, Frodo turned East towards Mordor. Somewhere out there was the wonderful land of Nurnenshire, soon to be his home. His gaze crossed the River Anduin, gazing only briefly at the heavily-dated ruins of Disgiliath; then going further they came across the great dome of Minas Epcot upon the mountain-range. The sanitized commercialism of Gondor gave way to the hideous neon glitz and media bombardment of the Enemy. Frodo's eyes unwillingly crossed the plain, passing billboards innumerable and countless one-hour motels. Gas wars were being fought. Commercialism was rampant. Film crews were busy with remakes of "Flipper" and "Mr. Ed". Orcs lit bonfires upon the plain and toasted marshmallows by having slaves hold them into the fires for them with their bare hands. In the center of the hideous arid plain he saw the deadly sputtering fire of Mount Viagra, which no man would admit to seeing. Its purple flames raged up unexpectedly, then crashed down to silence with a dozen undocumented side-effects.     And then Frodo saw it: a tower great and terrible, with buttresses of knife-edged iron, walls of impenetrable stone, doors of heavy adamant all marked "ENTRANCE ONLY"; battlement upon battlement, chamber upon chamber, window office upon window office, tall, black, immeasurably strong, laughing at flattery, filled with self-confidence, cracking its gum, telling bad jokes, and ringed with a thousand heavily-sharpened dinner forks: the Barad-dur, Fortress of Sauron the Terrible. Frodo stood as one turned to stone, unable to look away. The Ring suddenly felt heavier on its chain, like a great weight, dragging him downwards. In the Dark Tower Frodo felt an Eye which never slept; and then it became aware of him, a fierce will, unknowing of mercy, and now as it turned towards him he felt unable to move, unable to resist; and the Power came ever closer, reaching past Momin Lhaw, reaching towards him like an arm of terror; and then suddenly all went black, and there was a click, and Frodo could see no more.     "Pesky things," Frodo muttered to himself. "No wonder nobody uses them any more. You'd think a quarter would give you more than three minutes. And now I'm out of change." And he kicked the great coin-operated binoculars on their pivoting metal base, limped back a few feet, and sat on a stone bench.     After a moment Boromir came into the clearing. Seeing Frodo he immediately ran forward, drew his sword and prepared to cleave the puny Hobbit in half; but just as Frodo was about to scream he stopped, looked at his sword as if it had just been placed in his hand by a passing street-vendor, and laughed self-consciously as he put it back in its scabbard. "I, uh, I was just thinking about getting you a quarter," he explained lamely. "Halfling. Cut in half. Uhm, so, a quarter, you see. Get it? Ahh ha ha ha ha ha. Uhm. No, Really, Frodo, I am ill at ease. I came to talk to you. May I not sit down? The view's beautiful from up here. I'm surprised more people don't come by. I think a quarter for three minutes is very reasonable. Quite a bargain, really. Uhm. Oh, look, you cleaned the lenses. Jolly good. Though that's Union jurisdiction, you know. Could get in a lot of trouble. But I won't tell anyone if you don't. I mean, it's no big deal, you know, really. Um. Uh. So, uh... I guess you were really wanting to go to that estate in Nurnenshire, hm?"     "Yes," said Frodo.     "The one that the Great And Terrible Enemy Of All The Free Peoples is offering you."     "That's the one," said Frodo.     "And you believe it."     "Well, of course I do!" Frodo snapped, irate. "I've got a piece of paper and everything. It's all official. Look," he continued, reaching into his jerkin and pulling out the envelope from the Nazdaq, "it's got official-looking seals on it, and signatures in blood-red ink and everything. Yes, I'm sure it's only ink."     "You trust this?" Boromir demanded.     "Well, of course I do!" Frodo replied haughtily. "Sauron's a big and important man. I'm just an insignificant little hobbit who has, by chance, the blood of great and honoured nobility coursing through my veins. Why would he deceive me? He knows I'd be a valuable asset to Nurnen, that's all. And he's right." Frodo held up his head and looked to the East, hoping the light would catch his face just the right way and let Boromir see, just for a moment, the nobility of ancient and powerful Sea-kings in his visage, but the sun went behind a cloud and he continued to look like a puny insignificant little hobbit who was sticking his lower lip out obnoxiously.     "Maybe you aren't aware of the wiles of the Enemy," Boromir responded. "Here in Gondor we have been fighting a terrible battle against the Evil One for uncounted centuries. Once Gondor was a fair land, powerful and well thought of in the tourist trade; yet now it is but a shadow of its former self, bare and desolate, its concession stands all but closed, its parking lots bare-"     "Looked pretty crowded through the binoculars," Frodo cut in.     "That? A cruise ship from the Havens. We get those but twice a year, and had to make a big concession on the hotel fees even to get that. The rest of the time Gondor is a ghost town, our people unemployable, idle and bored. Yet that is but a part of our woes. The Nazdaq have conquered Minas Epcot, and made it into a place of horror-"     "I heard it was a place of horror already," Frodo interrupted.     "-and the Leech-king killed Eisner, the last King, in single combat; Eisner held two Aces and a Jack, and the Leech-king held a repeating crossbow with barbed and poisoned quarrels and a battleaxe-"     "So did he bluff?" Frodo asked.     "-and Disgiliath has fallen, and our Great Monorails can no longer run, and every day our defenses grow weaker. Even a single division of musketeers-"     "Mouseketeers?" cut in Frodo.     "Musketeers," Boromir corrected, "could aid us greatly; but we can't get them, because gunpowder hasn't been invented yet-"     "But we've got fireworks," Frodo interrupted pedantically.     "Do you realize you've interrupted five times in the last ten paragraphs?" Boromir said angrily. "I'm trying to make you realize that Sauron is a damned liar!"     "What?" Frodo demanded.     "A liar! A teller of falsehoods! A deceiver of men's hearts! Why the hell do you think everyone's been calling him evil? Why do you think we refer to him as 'Sauron the Base Lord of Treachery'? That document you're clutching and carrying everywhere in your sweaty little fist is a trap, you know - a trap devised by Sauron and delivered by the Nazdaq to reel you in and bring you to the Dark Tower!"     "But why?" Frodo demanded. "It doesn't make any sense! What would Sauron have to gain by trapping me? Use your head, Boromir, or take stronger medications-"     "Because of the Ring!" Boromir snapped, finally getting to interrupt Frodo for a change. "You have the Ring. It's Sauron's Ring. Sauron wants it back. And he'll torture and destroy you for it."     "Not true! Not true!" screamed Frodo.     "Of course it's true, dolt! Gandalf told you Sauron was a fool. El Rond told you too. But Sauron is no fool. He has been searching for his Ring, the power of which will make him stronger a thousandfold, and you're willing to go up and hand it to him! And then he would crush all resistance! He will destroy Gondor-"     "I'm not listening! I'm not listening!" Frodo screamed, sticking his fingers in his ears. "La la la la la la la-"     "And then Lorien," Boromir shouted, "and then Rivendell, and Edoras, and then he will trample the Shire and put its inhabitants all to torture and slow death as the price for your keeping the Ring in his despite - will you stop singing! - and all your precious Bagginses, or Bagginsi, or whatever they are, will die, and all the Brandybottles will die-"     "No! No! No! No! No!" Frodo yelled in agony.     "-and all the Tooks will die-"     "No!" screamed Frodo. "No! Sauron would never hurt Cassiopeia! Youdamnable liar!" And with that Frodo drew Sting and stabbed Boromir through the abdomen.     "Aaaaaaaaaggggghhhh!" screamed Boromir, and fell.     Frodo looked at Boromir. The powerful Man was trying to raise himself up onto his hands and knees, gasping desperately. Oh my Eru! Frodo thought. What have I done! I've killed Boromir! It's murder! Oh my Eru! He dropped Sting but then picked it up again to wipe it free of fingerprints, which only succeeded in getting even more of Boromir's blood onto his hands and tunic. Damn, he thought.     Boromir crawled away into the brush. Maybe nobody will find him, Frodo thought, looking after him. Yeah. That's fine. Or maybe we were attacked by Orcs. Everybody'd be fine with that. Maybe I'll say he attacked me first. After all, he's been acting pretty strange lately. I'll say he wanted the Ring. And I had to stab him.     But who'd believe that? Frodo answered himself. We were going to go to Gondor. Why would he take the Ring here? What would he want the Ring for, anyway? No, nobody'll buy a story like that. It's too implausible an idea.     "I've got to get out of here," Frodo said aloud to himself. "I'll go to Mordor alone. Sauron will protect me. Diplomatic immunity. After all, I'm a nobleman. And Boromir was an enemy of Mordor, after all. I'll have done Sauron a service. He should be grateful." And with that Frodo looked about, chose a path that would take him back to the boats without going near the others, and departed.     A pair of eyes gleamed from the underbrush. Underneath them could just be seen a mouth frowning in consideration. Then the eyes departed, also going down Momin Hen but by a faster way.     "Are you telling me Feenamint wasn't an inventor?" Lego-lass demanded.     "No, that's not what I said," Giggly answered with some heat, "I'm just saying he didn't do anything original. Now Oolee, now he made some truly original things. He was creative! Feenamint had good crafts skills, but he didn't really make anything very inspired, now did he?"     "I'd like to see you make a slipcast," Lego-lass said pointedly.     "Oh, sure, the slipcast; but he couldn't make the light, now could he?" Giggly said, triumphant.     "Nooo, he got that from the plants," Lego-lass smiled archly. "And that was Lavanna's work. Nothing to do with ol' Oilee whatsoever."     "Oolee," Giggly corrected.     "Anyway you don't see Dwaerrowseses making light or great jewels or anything, but they burn plenty of plants for firewood, or just for fun-"     "I'm not willing to listen to these add himinem attacks-"     But just then their engaging conversation was interrupted as Boromir, his hands over his bleeding midriff, stumbled headlong into the clearing. "Frodo!" he gasped. "It was Frodo-" And then he fell forward upon his face.     "Ai! Ai!" Lego-lass shrieked, and she and Giggly threw their arms around one another. The Dwarf drew his axe. "Fear nothing!" he giggled. "If I see that halfling bastard I'll protect y-..." And then with a sudden mutual impulse they leaped away from one another, both fighting shock and horror and some idea even more terrifying.     Aragon jumped to his feet. "The Ringbearer!" he yelled. "He's gone amok. We must now bring him to justice. Gimlet! Legless! Find my beloved Aardvark! Mungo, you and Piglet guard Boring® here. Meet me back at the boats!" And with that Aragon drew his sword and dashed up the path of Momin Hen. "Endurit! Endurit! Fear me, little Shire rat-bag!" he shouted.     Giggly and Lego-lass, themselves caught in a moment of utter emotional uncertainty, made for the west-path together, then for separate paths, then paused; then wordlessly reaching a decision the two followed Aragon up the trail, close after one another, but not too close.     A long silence fell. Moribund thoughtfully pulled out his pipe. "Soooo, Boromir," Morrie said slowly. "I think I've got some bandages in my pack... How much are they worth to you?"     Pipsqueak, sitting on a log watching Morrie bargain with the wounded Man, looked about the clearing idly. The grass was green, the trees and brush provided gentle shade and protection from the winds, and the foliage was beautiful to look upon. But then he saw something else, something subtly different in the trees, and a new and somewhat disquieting thought occurred to him.     When we came down the River, he thought to himself, there were those Orcs jumping around on the plains who looked a lot like trees. Being out on the plains it wasn't very effective camouflage, like Strider said. But in a place like this, with trees and bushes all the way around you... boy, if they looked like trees, I bet a whole battalion of Orcs could creep right up on you and you wouldn't even notice - unless you happened to look up at just the right moment.     "Uh, Morrie?" Pipsqueak said aloud in a quiet falsetto. "Uh, you might want to stop talking for a minute and look over here..."     Killer! Butcher! Murderer! Voices of guilt rang through Frodo's mind like mighty church-bells. You fool! They'll give you the Chair for this. What he meant by that he hardly knew, yet it frightened him. He envisioned a merciless and mighty Executioner beating him over the head with an immense, heavy chair. Mordor's my only hope. I've got to get to the boats. I've got to get to the boats!     Frodo stumbled blindly through the trees. He thought he heard some screaming off in the distance towards the camp, but it could just as easily have been the voices pointing fingers and crying J'accuse! in the labyrinths of his mind. There was also a crunching sound, a sound like breaking wood, which he disregarded until he reached the River, where he found Sam smashing the last of their three boats with Giggly's spare axe.     "Sam! What the hell are you doing!?"     Sam looked up. There was an evil look on his face, an evil smirk in his eye. "That's Mister Sam Gamgee to you, ye bourgeois Shire-born hobgoblin," Sam answered, hefting the axe with his strong working-class hands. "An' what I'm doin' is wreckin' these nasty seedy little death-traps afore ye try to use 'em again."     "But we've got to escape!" Frodo said dementedly. "There were Orcs! Hundreds of 'em! And they attacked me, and they killed Boromir, and-"     "No Orcs attacked ye," Sam replied, his dialect thick and pointed. "It was you as attacked Mister Boromir, of the Royal House of Gondor; and that's his blood there on your hands, it is, and all of Ulmune's oceans won't be enough t' wash ye clean of it. Aye, Mister Frodo, an' there's no denyin' it. I know all aboot it."     "That's crazed," Frodo parleyed. "If I had killed Boromir, how would you know-"     "Because I followed ye," Sam snapped. "After sneakin' in to the Council of El Rond, and followin' ye t' see the Lady's bath an' all, ye think I'd let this meeting go by unobserv'd? Nae, Mister Frodo, nae; and I do it because I don't trust ye, ye wee cutthroat. I scouted out all the paths, and I watched ye go up the great Hen, and I watched Boromir tell ye about Mordor an' Sauron's treachery, and I saw ye go nutso an' stab him. An' I knew ye'd be headin' for the boats - the nasty, accurs'd boats," he shuddered - "an' seein' as I had nae the stomach for 'em anyway, I did ye out of 'em an' satisfied meself doubly. So there's no goin' on, Mr. Frodo. Or should I say Mr. Mud."     "Sam, Sam," Frodo said, shifting mental gears and trying for supplication. "I had to do it. I had no choice. He was trying to stop me from going to Nurnenshire."     "And claimin' your estate," Sam sneered.     "Yes," Frodo answered, "and claiming my estate. Sam! I would have agreed to anything, if you could have helped me; but now the boats are smashed, and my hope is lost. I feared it was so. Damn it." And Frodo sat down heavily on the remains of one of the broken keels.     Sam looked at his master long and thoughtfully. "You'd've gone straight into Mordor?" he asked.     "Yes," Frodo answered. "Of course I would. Where the hell else would I go?"     "And you'd agree to anything t'get there?"     "Sure. Anything," Frodo said despondently. He played idly with a twisted oarlock.     Sam looked at him appraisingly. "So if I had a way to get you into Mordor, you'd go there willingly, and you'd agree to anything to be able t' do it?"     Something about Sam's tone made Frodo look up. "Sam? Is there another boat here or something?" he asked, rising to his feet. "If you're holding out on me-"     "Keep your hands away from th' sword!" Sam demanded, wielding the axe and producing a handful of deadly cutlery. "I'm only sayin' as I may be able to help you. To go to Mordor. But only on certain conditions."     "What conditions?" Frodo said desperately. "Name them!"     Sam leaned back, cheerfully. "We-ell," he said slowly, "for starters, I get a pay raise. Fifty percent. An' retroactive to the beginning of last year."     "Fifty per c-" Frodo started, then stopped himself. He could almost hear the rest of the Fellowship coming with bright keen Swords of Justice. "Oh, okay. All right. But only if we can leave right n-"     "And you has t' carry your half of the baggage," Sam continued, indicating the heavy packs lying next to one of the smashed boats.     "Oh, all right," Frodo replied. Under Sam's watchful gaze he shouldered one of the packs. It was astonishingly heavy. Frodo had never done menial labor before. "All right," he answered, trying to inhale. "All right. That's only fair, I supp-"     "AND you'll be doing half the cooking throughout the rest of the trip," Sam continued. "And the washing-up. And you'll stand half the watches. And give me the wake-up calls from now on."     "Ho-kay," Frodo gasped. He was concentrating on the pack.     "And before you go to Sauron to claim your little estate in Nurnenshire, ye'll write up a legal document that gives me complete ownership of Bag End," Sam added. "As a little bonus for years of long service. If you're profiting, I'm profiting too."     "Bag End! Oomph," Frodo said, trying to find his new center of gravity. How had Sam carried this thing for so long? "What do you want that for?... Well, all right, very well; I won't be needing it anyway."     "And just in case Boromir is right about the Ring," Sam added, "I don't want no Dark Baddies takin' over the Shire just when I'm about to come into my own. So ye'll be destroyin' the Ring before ye try to contact any officials or claim any Estate."     "Blackmail! Foul, tricky besotted blackm- Well, all right, I suppose; as long as it's on the way," Frodo answered, trying desperately to stay calm.     "And there won't be any more lickin' of fingers, or suckin' of toes or any other personal displays o' th' sort; an' if ye try it I'll cut your throat then and there, Mister Frodo. An' that's a fact," Sam added vehemently. "Swear to all that. Swear by the Deed."     "The Deed?" Frodo asked.     "Aye, the Deed," Sam answered. "By the Deed to Nurnenshire. Crooked as a three-dollar bill it may be, but it has a hold o' your soul, and ye'll never break that oath if ye want to enjoy your estate." Sam fairly spat out the last word, as though he had just avoided saying comeuppance instead.     "All right," Frodo answered. "I swear by the Deed to Nurnenshire that I shall go straight to Mordor, and to give you a fifty per cent pay raise retroactive to last year, and to carry half the baggage and do half the cooking and washing-up, and half the watches and wake-up calls, and give you a legal claim to Bag End before claiming the Estate, and destroy the Ring first, and not try to get you excited or suck on your fingers or toes or any other appendages. So help me Deed.     "Now, Sam," Frodo continued, as the pack straps dug painfully into his shoulders, "how do you propose we get across the River? Fly? Swim? Use that fourth boat you were keeping hidden in your mess-kit for later? Smelt some iron, forge a shovel and tunnel our way under?"     Sam smiled smugly. "We-ell, Mr. Frodo, I thought we'd walk a little bit farther South, and then walk across on that disused track for Boromir's ol' Monorail. See, it goes right across the water, there, straight over to Momin Lhaw."     "Sam! You're a genius!" Frodo laughed.     And soon later two little figures could just be made out walking across the narrow track towards the Eastern side of the River, one already starting to feel the weight of his great burden, and each with a hope in their hearts. For one of them went to Mordor hoping that the stories of Sauron's hatred and lust for vengeance upon Frodo would prove utterly false, and the other went hoping those same stories would prove satisfyingly true.     Time passed. The shadows moved slowly. Before long the sun reached its zenith.     "Aaaaiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaia ha ha ha hahahaaaaaaa!" The brush burst aside! A burst of deadly shuriken flew through the air, each cutting through the air of the clearing with a searing whine and embedding themselves into the trunks of trees. With a sudden flash of black leather a lithe figure leaped into the clearing, ronin-blade in one hand, sharpened darts in the other, keen-eyed, beautiful, confident and vicious. "Fear not!" the figure shouted. "Mighty Arwen, warrior-princess, is here!..."     After a moment the silence continued to greet her. She stopped. She paused. She looked at the sun. It was noon. It was noon! Where the hell was everyone? She looked about the empty clearing, angry, yet a desolation crept upon her heart. Did they leave early? Why would they do that? And where the hell were the Orcs?     Was she too late?     She checked the sun yet again. It must be noon! Must be. Maybe. Unless... unless they measured noon differently in southern climes. Or something. Anyway, why would they leave without her? Had they forgotten her? Those bastards!     There was some blood on the ground, trailing off towards Momin Hen. Probably Aragon had got another one of his nosebleeds. She'd told him high altitudes weren't good for him. There was some black stuff on the ground as well, a lot of it, which she might have identified as Orc-blood if she'd led a less sheltered life. Tree-sap, she thought to herself. Probably just some sort of tree-sap.     Arwen sat down dejectedly. She began idly throwing her silvered-steel darts at the picnic table. Every step she took went wrong. Every attempt to get more coverage in the movie seemed to backfire on her. She couldn't even get a mention in Chapter Seven. Dammit! What the hell was this? Some sort of conspiracy?     For a long moment the Elven-maid sat there, alone, her eyes unseeing.     Finally she stood. She pulled a few of the less-damaged shuriken back out of the trees where they had lodged. The throwing-darts she ignored. Gondor, she thought. They were going to Gondor. To Minas Tirith. Everyone was agreed. Well, I'll just follow them and meet them there. I shouldn't miss more than a chapter or two before I'm back with the others again. And Aragon had better have a damn good excuse for leaving me like this, the bastard.     With a final shrug Arwen picked up her pack, tied her hair back for practicality and left it there, and proceeded South, her feet tracking a perfect line straight towards Minas Tirith. She knew her way there, and she knew the others were going straight there as well. This time everything would work out. This time she was certain to be central to the plot. This time.
     "So you're going to go through with it, then," Gandalf the Wizard said slowly.     "I am," Bilbo replied. "I've been planning this for a long time. It'll give the Hobbits of the Shire something to talk about for the next nine days - or ninety-nine, more likely. Anyway, at least I'll have my little joke."     "Who will laugh, I wonder?" Gandalf mused aloud, scratching his beard idly.     For weeks carts and caravans were coming from all over Middle-earth to bring provisions for the Grand Old Party, as Bilbo referred to it. Wagons of food from the Dwarvish mines at Erebor, shiny rocks from the Sea-elves and fancy seductive packages from southern Mirkwood arrived daily, making the neighborhood generally more crowded and cluttering up avenues. Even those who hadn't said anything bad about Bilbo before were starting to show their annoyance. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is starting to get a mite annoying," old Gaffer Gamgee grumbled, standing outside the pub. "Queer goings-on, and no mistake. Why just yesterday a bunch o' pesky Wood-elves dragged their cart right acrost my yard and ruined my taters!"     "A bunch of Men from Bree came to my place yesterday and tried to sell me some aluminum siding," mused Old Noakes of Bywater. "They said it was because they had extra after building that horrible Quonset hut over the Party Tree, and they were trying to unload it. Strange folk hereabouts."     "Yes, but it's good for the economy," sneered Bill Ferny, the local banker. "A lot more money in circulation. Market's been doing well. Unionization is down because of all the entry-level service positions that are being created. Widening gap between the haves and have-nots, don't you think? Good to find work for idle hands."     "And you don't know nothin' about anythin', Ferny," Gaffer Gamgee snapped, echoing the popular community sentiment. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is a right bastard, as I've often said, and it's small wonder if trouble don't come of him and his imperialist ways. The Revolution's a'comin', and it's the likes o'you who'll be the first ag'inst the wall, so sayeth the Lord." And with that he spat a well-aimed beer-nut into Ferny's glass.     At last the day of the Big Party arrived. Everywhere there was too much to eat, and by midafternoon there were broken presents lying all over the Shire attesting to the low quality of their manufacture. Gandalf set off a series of fireworks later on in the day, including great skywriting missiles and little flaming butterflies who took to wing, sailed off into the Eastfarthing and burned all its trees to the ground.     The last firework sent up a great black smoke which took the shape of a giant mountain of fire. A flicker could be seen of a giant dragon sailing about its peak; after a moment the great dragon went sailing over the heads of the crowd, causing great panic and consternation and six outright heart attacks before imploding somewhere over the Sackville-Baggins' neighborhood, causing considerable property damage which was never properly repaired for generations afterward.     "That is the signal for supper!" Bilbo cried out to the survivors, who were only partly mollified.     Later on, in the specially-designed quonset hut which Bilbo had built especially for the occasion, all his friends and neighbors were helping themselves to their third helpings of macaroni and cheese and potato salad (the latter laced liberally with what Bilbo called the "traditional secret ingredient", which while not actually a narcotic still had unusual effects, the sum of which were still under scientific inquiry in some circles), Bilbo stood up and motioned for quiet. "A speech! A speech!" some of his neighbors cried out in fear.     My dear Hobbits! Bilbo began. There was much cheering at this, as Hobbits on the whole are a rather egocentric lot, and anyway the latest round of potato salad was beginning to kick in.     My dear Bagginses and Bracegirdles, Boffins and Borfledebees, Casmits and Cantankerums, Fassbinders and Fazoolas, Wombats and Wafflefoots. "WaffleFEET!" cried out an irate old man at the back, in fact the very man who had earned the name when Bilbo's nephew Frodo had accidentally dropped a hot waffle-iron on his feet some years ago. He had borne the Bagginses no ill-will, since the settlement was quite generous.     Wafflefoots, continued Bilbo, oblivious. This is my nine hundreth birthday! And though one million years is too short a time to have spent with you all...     There was some muffled conversation throughout the hall, which Bilbo took notice of. Well, on bad days it seems like a million years, he explained. Anyway, though ten billion years is long enough to endure from all of you, this is IT... I am GOING... I am leaving NOW... GoodBYE! And with that Bilbo leaped up, tore all his clothes off, scattering them about the astonished guests' heads, and ran from the great Hut screaming and flailing his arms.     Young Frodo looked on in bemusement, refusing to answer questions from the astonished crowd. Everyone knew, of course, that Bilbo was a big man in the community. But - and Frodo looked at the crowd, particularly noting the astonishment on old Lobelia's face - until now, nobody knew just how big.     "Well! That's done!" Bilbo laughed, emerging from the bedroom at Bag End freshly dressed. "You know, Gandalf, I've been wanting to do that for as long as I can remember. Now I think this would be an excellent time to leave the Shire, at least before they can all find their torches and axe-handles. Everything stays with Frodo, as we promised."     "Including the Ring?" Gandalf asked.     "Well, yes, I suppose so," Bilbo replied. He pulled the Ring out from under his cloak, where it hung on a fine golden chain Bilbo had stolen of old from the Brandybucks. "Still, though, I kind of hate to get rid of it."     "This seemed to me to be the only thing worthwhile about your whole stupid plan," Gandalf said uncharacteristically. "Put it on the mantel and walk away from it. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!"     "It's mine! And I shall keep it, I say!"     Gandalf raised himself up to his full height. Bilbo's hand reached quietly for the hilt of his sword. "It will be my turn to get angry soon," the wizard intoned. "Listen to me: you must give Frodo the Ring!"     Bilbo suddenly laughed. "Oh, that?" he grinned. "Well, of course I'm giving him the Ring! I thought you meant the chain." Slipping the Ring off the chain he set the circle of gold on the mantel without a second thought. Then he slipped the chain about his neck. "I love this chain. Stole it from old Matuseck Brandybuck back before he went senile. Wouldn't part with it for love nor money. No, I don't give two flies about the Ring. Nothing but trouble, that thing has been.     "Well, I'm off, Gandalf! I'm off on the road again, and not a moment too soon by the look of that crowd down there." And taking an old walking-stick from the stand by the door Bilbo went outside, taking a path around the back of the Hill so he could leave unobserved, and as he left he began singing a song quietly to himself:      While often by the door I lie      And look upon the mountains' feet      And think of rains and hikers' pains      And sleeping wetly in the sleet,      When darkness' cry does terrify      And wilderness encircles you,      And being food for goblins' brood      Is one choice, and starvation two;      Then staying home instead of roam      Will have a very great appeal!      Forego the Quest! And have a rest!      Let Dwarves and Elves and wizards squeal!      But since the Shire is filled with ire,      And all my neighbors fevers grip,      It's plain to see! I must agree!      The time has come to take a trip!     Hours later Frodo returned to Bag End, a little glad to have thrown off the pursuit at last. He started at first to discover someone waiting for him in the living-room, but sighed with relief when he saw it was only Gandalf.     "Did he get away?" Frodo asked.     "He did," Gandalf replied. "And just at the last, for they were getting ready to set after him with dogs. Luckily he doubled back at the Three-Farthing Stone, as I recommended, or there would be a special bonfire in Tuckborough tonight. Are you well?"     "Yes," Frodo replied. "I managed to convince everyone I was uninvolved with the Hay Incident."     "Good," Gandalf said. He lit his pipe with a nearby candle and looked at Frodo evenly. "He left things for you on the mantel. The deed to Bag End, a signed statement saying you were only an unwitting accomplice in the Bywater Incident, and-"     "The Ring!" Frodo said, looking at the mantel with astonishment. "Has he left me that?"     "He has," Gandalf replied, "though you'll have to find a new chain. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own - don't use it! Now or later! It may have other powers besides quick and easy seduction."     "I can't believe Bilbo left me the Ring," Frodo gasped. "He used to say that it and a bottle of Westfarthing Chinook was all you needed for the perfect weekend."     "Well, lock it up someplace and stay away from it," Gandalf intoned. "No Took-wives, no Elf-virgins, and no real estate deals. And no political aspirations! In the morning I'm off to see if I can learn more about it. In the meantime leave it unused until I return."     "I'll, uh, I'll think about that, all right," Frodo blurted, trying hard not to think about the Ring and young Cassiopiea Took.     The next morning Gandalf left, leaving Frodo with only his thoughts, his yearnings and a half-empty bottle of Westfarthing Chinook for company.
  The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. Indeed, thestory of Banger Baggins, who used to run around naked at night and ravishyoung maidens, became a favourite story, not least among those who could laya claim to belonging to that category. Frodo, however, remained wed tocelibacy. He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends,especially among the younger hobbits. His closest friends were PipsqueakTook and Moribund ("Morrie" or "the Mobster") Brandybuck, one of themfriendly and willing if somewhat pimply, the other as cold as ice and asruthless as a society hostess. Not for nothing were Morrie and his familyfeared throughout the Shire, even by the Shirriffs though those were all onthe Brandybuck paylist.  Frodo enjoyed being his own master and the Mr Baggins of Bag End. Helived on quietly, increasing his inherited fortune through wise investmentsand high-interest loans which earned him the nickname of "Sharkey", untilhis fiftieth birthday drew near. Then Gandalf turned up again. Frodowelcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard atone another.  "You are becoming grossly fat, Frodo," said Gandalf. "Luckily, I have somereally good exercise in store for you."  "You are too kind," murmured Frodo. "Please don't exert yourself on mybehalf."  "I'm afraid I have to," replied the wizard. "That ring of yours - do youstill have it?"  "Yes, of course," said Frodo. "I would gladly get rid of it; every timeI've tried it on I kept stumbling over my own invisible feet since I couldnot see them. I wish I had never accepted the pesky thing. Will you not takethe ring, Gandalf!"  "No!" cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. "That ring would bugger up myspells completely. No, no, I refuse! But I can give you some advice abouthow to get rid of it, if you want."  "What is that?" demanded Frodo.  "Take it to Mordor and drop it in the Cracks of Doom," said Gandalf. "Ifyou don't, Sauron will come and take it. And you don't want him to do that;he gets pissed off at people who have touched his precious ring." He lit acigar. "But if you put an end to the ring, you off Sauron too. The littledimwit infused so much of himself in the ring that his destruction with itis certain."  "But I remember how you once told me that Sauron thought the ring had beendestroyed."  "I did. He thought it had been thrown into the Cracks of Doom, as shouldhave happened. Now, however, he knows that it isn't so."  "But how can he have thought any such thing? If the ring had beendestroyed he wouldn't have been around; so he should have realized that thering had not been destroyed."  "As I told you, he is a dimwit. He really is incredibly stupid.All thesame, there was a scholarly article in The Minas Tirith Review about theRing yesterday, written by the learned Dr Faramir. Sauron must have readthat article; he subscribes to an excellent newscutting agency. Hisemissaries may be on their way to the Shire at this very moment."  "I had better leave at once," said Frodo.  "I agree," said Gandalf. Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo becameaware that all was very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to oneside of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust along arm out as if to catch somebody. Then his movement stopped. Hestraightened up and snorted.  "No one has been eavesdropping," he said. "Excellent. You'd better leaveas soon as possible, Frodo. Take that servant of yours, Sam, with you. Helooks like a sturdy lad and might come in useful."
  Despite Frodo's resolution to leave at once, he was in truth veryreluctant to start, now that it had come to the point.  One afternoontwo or three weeks after Gandalf's warning (or maybe four, or perhapsjust one; Frodo spent most of the days that followed drunk, and ratherlost track of time), Frodo went to the wizard for advice.  "Gandalf,"he asked, voice filled with concern, "I can't just vanish without atrace.  After Bilbo's farewell stunt, I'd never be able to look theold hobbit in the eye again if I didn't keep up the family tradition.Like father, like son, you know."  Gandalf, confused, said, "Father?  What are you talking about?Bilbo was your first and second cousin, once removed either way... Ishould know, I had to sit through two and a half hours of old GafferGamgee's genealogy lectures at the party.  Seating me next to him wasone of Bilbo's little jokes."  "Oh, well, you know," Frodo fumbled, "Bilbo did have the Ring andall, and my mother was quite comely when she was a lass... the wholething has been discussed before, though not generally in politecompany.  I'd rather not talk about it.  And anyway, this isn'tgetting me any closer to an excuse to leave."  "Don't worry, Frodo," replied Gandalf.  "I thought you might proveto be hesitant, so I've taken some steps of my own to provide for asuitably ignominious departure for you."  Just as Frodo gave Gandalf a sharp, suspicious look, a hammeringsound came down the hall from the front door.  "What in the heavens isthat?" cried Frodo.  "Unless I miss my guess," Gandalf explained, "those will be yourcreditors.  I took the liberty of closing your bank accounts andtaking out a number of short term loans in your name from some of yourcompetitors in the 'Sharkey' business.  As I recall, they come duetoday.  Incidentally, I've got to be off to, er, scout out the roadahead, so I'll just slip out and catch up with you later.  Look for mein Bree!"  And with that, the old wizard dashed off and was gone.  Frodo leapt out of his chair in a panic, as the hammering on thedoor became more insistent.  "What have you done with my money?" heyelled in the direction Gandalf had run, but he knew that chasing thewizard would only waste valuable escape time.  Fortunately, Pipsqueakand Morrie were visiting for the day, accompanied by Pipsqueak'sannoying younger brother Fatty, and Sam was back in the cellar doingsome unspecified repairs.  Quickly, Frodo rounded up his friends andexplained the situation.  "The Sackville-Baggins 'family' is here to take everything they canget their grubby hands on," Frodo explained, "and that includes me andall of my friends.  We'd better clear out in short order if we don'twant to end up at the bottom of Bywater Pool.  Quickly, now, runthrough the hole and grab everything valuable that isn't bolted down:the thought of the Sackville-Bagginses getting a hold of my thingsmakes me sick, and anyway, I'll be broke if we don't pile up some ofthis loot before we go."  Quickly the five hobbits scattered throughout the hole, filling oldpillow cases with whatever they could carry.  Frodo had a strong door,but now the pounding gave way to a repeated ramming sound; he knewthey didn't have much time.  He met Pipsqueak, Morrie, and Fatty inthe study as they had agreed: it was on the lefthand side of the hall(going in) like all the best rooms, for these were the only ones tohave windows large enough for a desperate hobbit to climb out in anemergency.  After a tense minute's delay, Frodo shouted back into thehole.  "Sam!" he called.  "Sam!  Time!"  "Coming, sir!" came the answer from far within, followed soon by Samhimself, wiping his mouth.  "I was just saying farewell to Rosi--um,the beer-barrel in the cellar."  Frodo looked down at Sam's hand.  "Give me that Ring," he snapped,as he yanked the ancient artifact off of Sam's finger.  With that,they all scrambled out of the window along with their bags of loot.Just at that moment, a great crash came from the hall as the doorfinally gave way.  "Sam," said Frodo once they were outside, "take this key to yourfather, and tell him to hold on to it.  We're going need it when wecome back for revenge.  Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick asyou can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows.  We are not goingthrough the village tonight.  Too many ears pricking and eyes prying."Sam ran off at full speed, while Frodo and the others loaded the cartthat Morrie had fortunately brought along that morning.  The sun went down.  Sad and frightening sounds came from within BagEnd in the dark, as the Sackville-Bagginses wrecked and looted theplace in their search for Frodo.  Once the cart had been hastilypacked, Frodo sent Morrie and Fatty with it on ahead.  Morrie was,as a rule, terrible company on a hike, and Fatty was a hundred timesworse.  "Sam and Pipsqueak and I will meet you at the safehouse inCrickhollow the day after tomorrow," he said, and they drove away asquietly yet quickly as they could.  Frodo looked back at the dark black windows of Bag End, some ofwhich were being smashed out as he watched.  One of the windows nearthe cellar seemed to have a ripped piece of a hobbit lass's dress tornand fluttering on a nail. He waved his hand to his long home."Good-bye!" he said, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he hadknown it) hurried after Pipsqueak down the garden path.  Taking themost secret route they knew, they jumped over the low place in thehedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the blessedconcealment of darkness like a cattle rustler into the grasses.  They met Sam at the gate, and proceeded along the deserted lane fora mile or two, at which point they cut off into the fields to throwoff pursuit.  After some time they crossed the Water, and made theirway toward the hilly country to the south.  "Well, I'll say this,"remarked Frodo as he looked back into the valley of Hobbiton and backto the Hill, where tiny flames had begun to rise from the vicinity ofBag End, "that was quite an exit.  I wonder if I'll ever be able toshow my face in that valley again?"  Sam and Pipsqueak were walking onahead exchanging dirty stories, and Frodo's question went unanswered.  The three friends walked on and on into the night.  Eventually, themoon set, and after Pipsqueak nearly fell into a deep streambed forthe third time, the hobbits agreed that they should stop where theywere and sleep for the night.  Of course, none of them had thought totake any bedding with them on the trip, so they all curled up on topof the tree roots nearby, ignoring the soft, comfortable bed offir-needles that covered the ground beyond the roots.  They set nowatch: they had drawn lots, but when Frodo and Sam noticed Pipsqueakcheating they all decided it was a lost cause and went to bed.  A few creatures came and looked at them as they slept.  A foxpassing through the wood on business of his own stopped severalminutes and sniffed.  "Hobbits!" he thought.  "And sleeping out ofdoors under a tree at that.  There's something mighty queer behindthis.  I'd better head off to tell my friends Bombadil, Gandalf, andEl Rond all about it in short order.  Good thing I can speak Westron."  The next morning came, pale and clammy.  The three friends went onwalking through the trees, and Frodo began to chant to himself in alow voice:     The Road goes ever on and on,     and on and on and on and on,     and on and on the Road has gone,     why did I let Morrie drive the cart?Sam and Pipsqueak stopped and gave Frodo an odd look, but when hedidn't respond they all went on their way, deeper into the wood.  The sun was beginning to get low and the hobbits had just passedinto a stand of beech trees when they heard hoofbeats on the roadbehind them.  "Quick!" whispered Frodo, staring back the way they hadcome.  "They must have found our tracks sooner than we thought.  Hidebehind the trees!"  He turned back around, and realized that hisfriends hadn't needed his advice: they had already run a good waysinto the wood and buried themselves under a pile of leaves.  Frodohimself only had time to duck behind a nearby statue of a Pukel-manwhen a tall black horse came into view.  On it sat a large black man, wearing a dark, dark grey cloak andhood.  When the horse reached the statue level with Frodo it stopped,and the black man started looking from side to side, breathingheavily.  A light breeze blew in Frodo's direction, and Frodo caught awhiff of a terrible smell like last Easter's missing egg.  He gagged,and the black man stared toward his hiding place and began to climboff of his horse.  But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song andlaughter.  The black man started to tap his foot, then hum along withthe music.  Finally, he started singing out loud, and then suddenlyrealized what he was doing.  He got an extremely sheepish look on hisface, leapt up on his horse, and rode away in utter embarrassment.  "Elves!" exclaimed Sam, coming with Pipsqueak to Frodo's side."Elves, sir!"  Frodo nodded, and as the voices drew nearer, their songbecame clearer:     O! What are we doing,     And where are we going?     We're soon barbecuing!     The river is flowing!       O! tra-la-la-lally         up out of the valley!     O! What are we seeking,     And where are we making?     The faggots are reeking!     The bannocks are baking!       O! tril-lil-lil-lolly         the vally was jolly,            ha! ha!Well, okay, not that much clearer, but Elves are like that.Nevertheless, Sam stood enchanted.  "Is it true, Mr. Frodo, that Elveshave drugs the like of which no mortal has ever known?  It certainlysounds like it."  Frodo answered, with awe but not without disappointment.  "Yes, Sam.These are, indeed, High Elves.  Sadly, they share not their preciousdrugs with outsiders.  Still, they can be good company, and they surethrow a great barbecue."  As the Elves drew near, Frodo stepped out into the path.  "Elen silalumenn' omentielvo!" he said in his most friendly tones.  The Elves appeared confused.  "What do you mean, Frodo, that yoursister has a wombat through her tea-time?"  Frodo cursed under hisbreath, and swore a silent oath to himself never to trust Bilbo'slanguage lessons again.  The Elf went on, "No matter.  You look wearyand hungry; would you like to come with us to dinner?"  "Certainly, good people," replied Frodo greatfully, for the dinnerinvitations of the High Elves are rare and prized indeed, "but how doyou know my name?"  "We have watched you long," they laughed, "and your father Bilbobefore you."  At this, Frodo winced, but they took no notice. "Youradventures with that young Cassiopiea Took were quite amusing, and asfor Bilbo, well..." Frodo was now blushing furiously, and the Elves(together with Sam and Pipsqueak) simply laughed again and said nomore.  They passed on into the night, until they came to a clearing inthe wood.  In the clearing, there stood a ring of great upright standingstones, connected from top to top with other great stone slabs allaround the circle.  "Welcome to Sto-wan-hensh, our hall of feasts,"said Gildor, the leader of the Elves.  "You are fortunate: it isalmost time for supper."  Even as Gildor spoke, an Elf sighting along two tall stones criedout, "The stars are now in place!  It's ten o'clock; soup's on!"Torches and bonfires leapt into life all around the stone circle, andsoon the entire company was happily eating barbecued fox and toastedcornbread.  A large flat stone in the center of the ring had beenscrubbed clean, and was surrounded by blazing fires that heated italmost until it glowed; an Elf was frying bacon on its top.  Thehobbits tried not to feel disappointed when the High Elves didn'toffer them any miruvor when it was passed around, but other thanthat the evening was perfect.  Frodo soon decided to share some of his fears and concerns withGildor as they ate.  "Gildor, what would a black man be doing in theShire?  We were pursued by one today, and he only left when he heardyour company approach."  "A black man?  In the Shire?" said Gildor doubtfully.  "I have neverheard of such a thing, not since the old days of the Kings and theirbattles with Angmar.  Just about everyone in this part of the world isCaucasian, and that's a fact."  "And yet," explained Frodo, "he was there, and I was frightened.I've never been comfortable around minorities."  From the background, Pipsqueak spoke up, "Be sure to tell him about thesmelling!  I'm sure it is very important!"  "Well," Frodo said to Gildor, "he did have this awful odor..."  Gildor cut Frodo off sharply.  "Hold it right there.  This story isracist enough as it is; we don't need any comments about 'BlackBreath' making it worse."  "Right.  We'll drop the subject," said Frodo.  "Nevertheless, I ampursued, even before I have left the Shire.  I am supposed to meetGandalf in Bree, but I don't know how I'll even make it that far, orwhat to do if he isn't there.  I'm at a loss, I'm frightened, and I'mbearing a terrible burden on which may rest the fate of allMiddle-earth.  Can you give me any advice?"  "No.  Yes." said Gildor.
	In the morning Frodo awoke refreshed.  He was lying in a bower made bya living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground;  his bedwas of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant.  The scentwas almost intoxicating and Frodo was dizzy with light-headedness.  Hejumped out and went down.	Sam was sitting in the grass near the edge of the wood quietly gigglingto himself.  Pipsqueak was standing studying the sky with open mouthedawe.  There was no sign of the Elves.	"They have left us some fruit and drink, and bread," said Pipsqueak. "Come and have your breakfast.  The bread tastes strange, butwonderful!  I didn't want to leave you any, but Sam thought it might doyou some good."  At this the hobbits laughed under their hands at Frodo.	Unperturbed, Frodo sat and sampled some of the Elves' bread.  It wasbrown and sweet and had an unusual peppery tang that he couldn'tidentify.  Sam came and sat by him as he broke fast.  "What's the planfor today?" asked Pipsqueak.	"To walk to Bucklebelt as quickly as possible," answered Frodo, andgave his attention to the food.  Odd as it was, it seemed to make himfeel better and better.	"Do you think we'll see those Riders?" asked Pipsqueak cheerfully. Under the Elven bread's spell, a whole troop of Black Riders did notseem so alarming to him.	"Yes, probably," said Frodo, "but I hope to get across the riverwithout their seeing us."	"Did you find out anything from Gildor?"	"No, not really."	"Did you ask about the smell?"	"We didn't discuss it," said Frodo with small embarassment.	"You should have. I am sure it's terribly important!"	The hobbits eyed Pipsqueak for a moment before they all broke out intopeals of laughter that they did not understand.	"My," gasped Frodo after regaining some control over his mirth, "thisis fine bread!"	They soon broke camp and started again their long trek.  After a while,Frodo called a halt and the Hobbits discovered that they had walked toofar to the south.  After some small debate, they made straight East intoa wood that offered some shelter against the coming rain.  As theymarched, Sam thought he caught a glint of steel in the distance andstopped short.  As he turned his head to look, Sam could have sworn hesaw an elf-maid heavily armed and camoflauged peering from behind a bushat him, but when he blinked, nothing was there.	"What's the matter, Sam?" asked Pipsqueak.	"What? Oh, nothing master Pipsqueak, sir.  Just the rain playing trickson me, I suppose.  I could use a rest for a bit, and that's a fact."	To this they all agreed and made for the shelter of a majestic Elm.	Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pipsqueak sat near, and they began to hum, and then to singsoftly:				Yo!  Ho!  Ho!  and a bottle of rum!		Fifteen men on a dead man's chest,		The cabin-boy and Cap'n, an outrage to some.		But me Parrot on me shoulder, he's the best.		An the scurvy dogs a lyin' in davy Jones' locker		Will rise at the latter day - oh what a shocker!Yo! Ho! Ho! they began again louder.  They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet.  A long-drawn wail came down the wind, likethe cry of some fell and lonely creature: (heh) (hehhehehheh) (snicker) (SLAP) (SPANK) (heh) (heheh) (heheheh) (snicker) (heh) (Bwwwaaaahahahahahahaa!) (heheheh) (..........heh)  It rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note.  Even as they stood, it was answered by another cry fainter and further off, but no less blood-chilling.	"What do you think that was?" asked Pipsqueak in a terrified voice. "That weren't no bird I ever heard."	"It wasn't any bird or beast," said Frodo, "There were words in thatcry, though I could not catch them." 	No more was said and the Hobbits quickly gathered their gear and movedon through the woods.  Very soon they came to a clearing and beyond tofields planted with poppy and a strange variety of mushroom.	"I know these fields!" cried Pipsqueak.  "We've wandered farther souththan we thought.  These are Michel Delving's fields."	"Who's that?" asked Sam.	"I'm sorry. You'd know him better as Farmer Maggot, I think."	"One trouble after another," said Frodo.  "I've been horribly afraidof Farmer Maggot ever since he caught me trying to steal some of hismushrooms as a lad.  He beat me and then showed me to his wood shed. 'See, lads,' he said, 'next time this varmint sets foot on my land, youcan eat him.  Now see him off!'  They chased me all the way to the ferryand I've never got over the fright!"	"Well, it's time you made it up, then, cousin," said Pipsqueak andheaded off across the fields.	"Don't you worry, master," said Sam, "I won't let no one beat you thistime, and that's a fact."  Frodo screwed up his courage and set afterthem, to what doom he knew not.	Suddenly, as they drew nearer to the farm-house, a terrific groaningand grating broke out, and a loud voice was shouting, "Twig!  Branch!Elm!  Come on, lads!"	The hobbits stopped dead and very soon the gate opened and three hugelogs came rolling out into the lane and dashed towards the travellers,barking fiercely.  They took no notice of Pipsqueak but two of themcornered Sam and looked at him in a way that can only be described aswoodenly.  The largest and fiercest of the logs halted in front ofFrodo, bristling and growling in a deep timbre.	Through the gate came the largest man any of the hobbits ever saw."Hallo!  Hallo!  And what may you be wanting?" he asked.	"Good afternoon, Mr Delving," said Pipsqueak.	The farmer looked at him closely. "That's Maggot to you, masterPipsqueak - Mr Paragraph Took, I should say!" he cried with relief. "It's been a long while since I saw you about these parts.  It's a goodthing I recognised you; I was about to set my logs on you after thequeer vistor I had this morning."	"Who would that be, Mr Maggot?" asked Frodo.	"You didn't see him?  He left not half an hour ago.  All dressed inBlack he was and as foul smelling a customer as you could hope to meet. Came riding right through my poppies, he did, and right up to my doorbold as you please. 'This path don't lead no where,' I said to him, 'yourbest way is straight back to the road.'	"'I'm looking for Baggins,' he hissed at me.  	"'Who are you?' says I.	"'Ummmmm.....'	"'Your name's "M"?'	"'Yeeeessss, that's right, my name's M.  Now will you tell me ifBaggins comes?  I will bring gold!' he said.	"'Oh no, you won't,' I said.  'You'll bugger off back the way you cameand double quick!  You can use the path this time.'  I set the logs ontohim but he struck a match and they shied away even as he stormed outright over my poppies again!  Now then, Pipsqueak, who're yourcompanions?"	"Well, this is Sam and that's Frodo Baggins," said Pipsqueak.	"Well, if that isn't queerer than ever.  You best come inside," saidMaggot and waved his arm for them to follow him.	Later, they all passed the news while waiting for Mrs Maggot to finishpreparing dinner.  Frodo and Sam learned much about Mr Maggot and hisdoings.  He told them that the guard logs were given to him by hisbrother who lived in the enchanted part of the old forest (or 100 acrewood as it is known in latter days) and told them also of his dealingswith the Elves and their lust for the distillation made from his poppiesknown as Morofeen that brought Mr Maggot most of his business thesedays.	"Haven't seen much of old Bombadil in a long time though," Maggot said,"lives in the old forest, too, he does.  Used to buy my mushrooms by thebushel-full, but now with all the ill news and all, I can hardly pushoff my special 'shrooms to the Hobbit teens down Bucklebelt way."	Then the table was set with all the hobbits could eat, and thecenterpiece was a large bowl of steamed mushrooms.	"I'm sure our master Frodo still has a liking for mushrooms, Idaresay," jibed Maggot.	"How did you..."	"Oh, I remember you all-right, Mr Baggins!"  A cough from Sam drewattention.	"I'm afraid Sam has heard about your beating me and is a little wary ofyou, Mr Maggot," put in Frodo quickly, secretly waving Sam into closinghis flick-knife.	"Well, I'm sorry I beat your master, Sam, but he oughtn't have thievedmy mushrooms.  Least of all those kind.  Only for special customers Igrow them.  Cost me a bundle, your Mr Frodo did, and right sick he wouldhave been, too, if he'd've eaten them.  No, these mushrooms are betterfor you and me!"  said Maggot digging another spoonful of butteryfungus onto his plate.	After a respite and a further dinnner and another respite, Mr Maggotoffered to take the travellers to the Bucklebelt ferry in his cart toavoid any strangers waiting to waylay them on the road.  When all wasprepared and the cart loaded, it was well after dark and Frodo worriedthey might miss the last ferry and Morrie both.  But his fears wereeased when after the hobbits climbed aboard the cart and were hiddenunder a tarpaulin, Mr Maggot lifted mightliy on the two levers and setoff at a great pace down the road.  They were bumped and bruised as thecart's single wheel endeavored to find every crack and rock in the road,or so it seemed to Frodo.	To break the agony of their journey, Frodo slipped on the ring andcalled in a cooing voice, "Ohhhhh Saaaammmm. Sammy SammySammm-Saammmm.."	"Now cut that out, Mister Frodo!  It not funny trying to get me all hotand bothered just so's you can laugh at me, and that's a fact!"  Samspat indignantly.	"Oh, Sam, I'm only having you on.  No need to be upset." said Frodo.	"Well as long as you're not trying to have it off with me, we'll getalong just fine, and that's a fact!"	"Do you end all your sentences with and that's a fact?" askedPipsqueak.	"I don't know what you mean, Mister Pipsqueak, and that - "  Thehobbits rolled with laughter for the rest of their trip.	An hour later they felt a sharp bump as Mr Maggot dropped his loadheavily.  They could hear him whispering to someone on the road.	"Don't you come a step nearer, missy!  Who are you and what do youwant?"  There were sounds of a struggle and then a sharp high-pitchedyell followed by the sound of something large being dropped into theriver.  Soon, Mr Maggot opened the make-shift cover concealing thehobbits and bade them get out.	"What happened, Mr Maggot?" asked a very worried Frodo.	"Well, there was this queer looking lady in the road holding up thebrightest sword ever I saw.  I went up to her and her face was paintedall green and brown like.  She's an elf if ever I saw one, but why shelooked so fearsome, I do not know.  Anyway, she takes a swing at me withher sword, but missed her mark, so I gave her a shove just to learn herwho her betters are, but I shoves too hard and wouldn't you know -straight over the side of the Bridge she drops right in the water.  Ilooked for her and thought of calling you all out to help me, but shedisappeared just as any frog might do.  No sign of her now, though."	As he was finishing his tale, the sound of hoof-beats approached andthey all were relieved to see Morrie riding up across the bridge tomeet them.	"There you are, Frodo!" he cried "I was worried when you didn'tarrive by nightfall, so I came looking for you.  Hallo, Mr Maggot!"	"Good Ev'nin to you, master Moribund!  Well, I'll leave you all now andget myself home.  I hope you'll stop travelling and settle down, MrFrodo, now you're here with us."	"Thank you," said Frodo, "and thanks for all your kindness."	"Well," he said after Maggot had gone a fair distance, "what are wewaiting for?  Let's get to the ferry."	"Begging your pardon, Mr Frodo, sir,"  said Sam, "It seems to me wecould cross just as well by this here bridge, if you take my meaning."The hobbits' blank expressions showed they clearly did not.  "Why can'twe just cross here the way Mr Morrie did and save ourselves some timeand maybe trouble of another sort?  We'd be a dead target for thatelf-maid - or whatever she was - us riding on the water, and that's a....."  Again Pipsqueak and Frodo howled with laughter, and Morrie ledthe way down the side of the bridge to where the ferry was tethered.
   "Well," said Morrie, as the laughter subsided, "we'd best be going ourselves.  I'm looking forward to a meal and a pint of ale."  Across the river the hobbits could see the cheerful glow of neon lights blinking in the windows of Brandy Hall.   Long ago, Gorhendad Oldbuck (Morrie's great-great-great-grandfather, his great-great-uncle, or his third cousin once removed, depending on which branch of the family tree you trace) was the town drunk of Bywater.  People called him all kinds of names -- Drunkenbuck, Alebuck, and the like -- but the name that stuck was Brandybuck.  Unfortunately for him, he lived at the time of the Shire's great experiment with prohibition.  Unhappy with the dry state of affairs, he moved across the Brandywine River and set up his own little country, where the alcohol flowed freely.  Pretty soon, the greater portion of the Shire's population was packed into a small strip of land between the River and the Forest.  The mayor of Michel Delving finally admitted defeat and repealed prohibition.  Most hobbit folk returned to the four farthings, but Brandybuck and his family had set up a nice home in Bucklebeltland, so they stayed behind.  To this day, Bucklebeltland is still known for it's cavalier attitude towards the Shire's laws (making it the perfect place for Frodo to hide out from tax laws and bill collectors), and also for the fine quality of its many pubs.   As the ferry-boat moved away from the shore, Sam peered uneasily at the darkly swirling water, convinced that an armed elf-princess would jump up and bonk him on the nose.  Knowing the Bucklebeltlanders' reputation, he wasn't sure that he liked the idea of taking a boat piloted by Morrie (after all, Frodo's parents Gordo and Primadonna had died in an accident involving drinking and boating).  "Um, about that bridge," he offered, "couldn't that Black Rider fellow just ride across and attack us on the other side?"   "Samwise, my butt," grumbled Morrie to himself, "Samfool is more like it."  Aloud he answered, "It's clearly posted that you have to take boats eastbound, and since this is the last boat, we'll be safe."   Peering into the murk, Sam could just make out a dark figure walking around on the west bank.  The figure moved towards the bridge, but noticing a sign it turned dejectedly and disappeared into the night.   "Here we are," declared Morrie as the ferry pulled into its slip.  "Coming, Sam?"  Looking around, Sam realized that Pipsqueak and Frodo had already scrambled ashore.  "C'mon, Sam, Crickhollow is just around the corner and Fatty's getting dinner on."   Entering Crickhollow, Frodo could tell that his friends had taken great pains to set it up just like his old home at Bag End.  All of his posters were already up on the walls, his fish were swimming happily in an aquarium set up in the corner, and they had even left a pile of his dirty laundry beside the T.V.  He felt ashamed that they'd gone to all of this work and he was going to have to leave them.   "Dinner smells great," said Pipsqueak to Fatty, who was just coming out of the kitchen, "but after sleeping under a tree last night I need to wash up first.  It's bath time."   "Which order shall we go in," said Frodo.  "Smartest first, or cutest first?  You'll be last either way, Master Pipsqueak."   "No fear!" said Merry, "There are two tubs back there.  You're left with the shower, though, Sam.  In a class-based society such as this you really can't expect a servant-boy like you to enjoy the same luxuries as your betters."   As the three travelers filed back to the washroom, Sam was muttering something about ". . . first one up against the wall when the revolution comes."  Soon, though, the sound of splashing and wallowing was mixed with the sound of Pipsqueak's favorite bathing song.   Rubber Ducky, you're the one,   You make bathtime lots of fun,   Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you;   (woh woh, bee doh!)   Rubber Ducky, joy of joys,   When I squeeze you, you make noise!   Rubber Ducky, you're my very best friend, it's true!   (doo doo doo doooo, doo doo)   Rubber Ducky, you're so fine   And I'm lucky that you're mine   Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fond of -   Rubber ducky, I'd like a whole pond of -   Rubber ducky I'm awfully fond of you!There was a terrific flush, and a shout of "Whoa!" from Sam as he was scalded in the shower.  It wasn't long before all three were drawn back to the dining room by the smell of Fatty's roasted mushrooms.   Now, if you've ever met a hobbit, you know that they love to eat.  For such little guys, they can pack away a lot of food, which is why you'd betterbe sure you've a well-stocked larder before inviting a hobbit home for the weekend.  Above all, though, hobbits loved mushrooms.  Hobbit gourmands had identified seven hundred and thirty eight varieties of edible mushrooms, and from the look of his waistline, you could tell that Fatty was familiar with them all.  He'd prepared a sumptuous six course feast based completely around fungus.  He started with a nice little appetizer of mushrooms stuffed with cheese, followed by a salad of morels, stir fried shitakes, grilled portabellos, and roasted truffles.  He ended it all with mushroom ice cream, but curiously everyone decided they were full at that point, and pulled their chairs around the fireplace to talk.   "Well, I'm not sure exactly how to say this . . ." started Frodo when Pipsqueak interrupted.   "Years from now," he began, "when someone writes the story of ouradventures, no one is going to want to dwell on this scene.  They'll want tomove ahead into the action, so let's not draw this out.  Let's just pretend that you already know that we know all about the Ring . . . "   "But how?" protested Frodo.   "Do you think we're idiots?" Morrie piped in.  "You'd never have a chance with Pipsqueak's cousin Cassiopiea without magical help.  You're myfriend, man, but I've got to say that you've got a face only a mother could love.  A blind mother."   "Anyway," continued Pipsqueak, "let's just pretend that we've alreadytold you we're going with you, you've protested, and we've insisted.  Sam's nice and all, but let's face it, he's a bit of a stick in the mud.  Adventures will be a lot more fun with Morrie and I along."   "You are a set of scoundrels!" cried Frodo.  "Bless you one and all." They all danced around Frodo (not that there's anything wrong with that) and Morrie and Pipsqueak started a song they'd apparently composed for the occasion.   Farewell we call to hearth and hall!   To hobbit lasses one and all.   To Cassiopiea, Mary Jane,   To Beth, and Ruth, and sweet Lorraine.   To the wafflefoot twins with kisses sweet,   To all the gals with those sexy bare furry feet.   Someday we'll return to this corner of the world,   And maybe even Sam will meet a nice hobbit girl.   For now we're off on a quest of sorts,   To meet the women found in exotic ports.   We might find elf-maids with pointy ears,   Or even kiss dwarf girls (after eight or nine beers).   We must be gone, we must be gone.   We leave before the crack of dawn!   "Actually, guys, if it's okay with you, could we wait until about nine or so?" asked Frodo.  "I'm exhausted."   "Well, of course we'll sleep in.  'Nine' just doesn't rhyme.  'We must be gone, we must be gone, we leave before the crack of nine'?  Old Bilbo would have never let me get by with a song like that," said Morrie.  "I've got it all set up.  We'll wake up at nine, Fatty will make up a nice breakfast of mushroom omelets, Sam will pack all of our bags while we have a nice leisurely smoke, and we'll be gone by noon.  Our route takes us hiking through the Old Forest."   Fatty suddenly went pale.  "Wait a minute!  No one told me anything about the Forest!  I can't go in there, I'm afraid of trees!"   "You're afraid of trees?  What kind of pansy are you?" demanded Frodo.  "If you can't handle a few trees, you're not going to do us much good on the road.  Maybe you should stay behind and tell Gandalf where to find us."   Fatty seemed relieved that everyone agreed to this plan.  After some final preparations, they all settled down to bed.   After tossing and turning for some time, Frodo finally settled down into an uneasy sleep.  Eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees.  When he turned away from the window to face the classroom, he noticed he wasn't wearing any clothes.  Just then, the teacher started to pass out an exam that he hadn't studied for.  In a panic, he woke up.
    Frodo woke suddenly.  It was still dark in the room, and hefelt almost as if he were falling.  A moment later he hit thefloor.  Blearily he looked up to see the light of a candle flameburning in the doorway.  "What?  What is it?" said Frodo, stillshaken and bewildered.    Out of the fire there spoke a voice. "What is it!" criedMorrie.  "I have been pounding on your door for five minutes.It's nearly ten, Fatty's eaten half your breakfast and we must beleaving soon.  You'll have to make do with the scraps while I getthe ponies ready."    It was, of course, not so bad as all that.  Fatty had preparedmore than enough for a hobbit twice Frodo's size and there wasplenty left.  So Frodo had a nice breakfast with eggs and sausageswhile the others finished preparations for the journey ahead.    Soon after twelve o'clock the five hobbits were ready tostart.  Frodo was still yawning.  Morrie went in front leading anoverburdened pony, and took his way along a path that went througha small grove behind the house, and then trampled across severalfields.    In a shed they found their ponies: four sturdy beasts of thekind loved by hobbits.  They mounted, and were soon riding alongunder the midday sun.  Ahead of them loomed the Hedge.    "How are you going to get through the Hedge?" asked Fatty.    "I will show you!" said Morrie.  He turned left along theHedge, and they came to a ramp leading down.  A passage had beendug into the earth and walled with brick, forming a tunnel leadingunder the Hedge and into the Forest on the far side.    Here Fatty stopped, quailing at the sight of the trees.  "Good-bye friends!" he said.  "I wish you were not going into theForest.  I'm afraid there won't be anyone to rescue you, but goodluck to you."    "Tell Gandalf to go along the East Road; we shall soon be backon it ourselves," said Frodo.  They waved and disappeared into thetunnel.    They passed a gate on the far side and Morrie locked it behindthem.    "Well!" said Morrie.  "We have left the Shire, and are now onthe edge of the Old Forest."    "Are the stories true?" asked Pipsqueak, casting a glance backto the tunnel.    "I don't know which stories you mean," answered Morrie.  "Idon't believe those old bogey stories such as Fatty's nurses usedto tell him.  Goblins and wolves and walking trees!  No, I don'tthink so, but the Forest is queer. Sometimes you'll feel someonewatching you, but when you look about there's no one there.  Thereare queer things living deep in the Forest, and in the downs on thefar side and someone makes tracks amongst the trees.  Not far fromthis tunnel there should be a path which will take us northeastthrough the Forest.  Due east would put us onto the Downs and southwould take us to the Witherwander River which starts out on theDowns and joins the Brandywine in the south of the Forest.  Nohobbit has ever charted its full course.  We don't want to go THATway!  The Witherwander valley is the worst part of the whole wood -full of bogs and swamps, sinking sands and unfriendly creatures."    The hobbits now left the Hedge and rode up another ramp to thefloor of the Forest.  The trees were thick about them almostimmediately, trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes:  straight orbent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled andbranched or branchless, clustered or scattered, tall, short,lightning scarred, intertwined, infested, bewebbed, mossy, dark,damp, shimmering, peeling, vine covered, young or old, flowering,deciduous, coniferous, fruit bearing, creaking, cracked, hollow,budding and dying, burned, slimy, shaggy, scaley, green, grey,brown, and, well, just a very lot of different kinds of trees.    They went on for some time, the ponies carefully picking theirway through the twisted and interlacing roots.  The ground rosesteadily, and as they went forward it seemed as if the trees becametaller, darker, thicker, danker, and a great many other ominousadverbs as well.  They could catch only occasional glimpses of theSun through the thick trees overhead, and each time they did theyseemed to have veered somewhat off course and would have to turnagain to the northeast.  After an hour or two the trees closedoverhead completely, wrapping them in a twilight gloom that leftthem guessing at their direction and able to do little more thanmove steadily forward.    The afternoon was wearing away when they stumbled into a deepfold in the ground.  It was so steep and overhung that it provedimpossible to climb out of, in either direction, without leavingtheir ponies behind.  As that would require carrying their ownfood, and rather alot of it at that, it was completely out of thequestion.  All they could do was to follow the fold - downwards.The ground grew soft, and in places boggy, and soon they foundthemselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through aweedy bed.    There was not yet any sign of a path, and the others began towonder if Morrie were not completely lost.  Pipsqueak suddenlyfelt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning letout a shout.  "Oi! Ai! Ee!" he cried.  No one was quite sure why."You don't have any idea where you are going, do you!"    Morrie shot him a venomous look, a glare that would havewarned any of his business associates against further words.  "Ishould not shout if I were you," said Morrie.    Pipsqueak, however, was undeterred.  "It has not taken you longto lose us!"  Morrie's face became grim and he nudged his ponyforward with blood in his eyes.  It might have gone badly forPipsqueak then, but just as Morrie was drawing close Sam let out awhistle and pointed ahead.    "Look, isn't that an opening up ahead?" asked Sam.    A short distance ahead the gully came to an end and led quitesuddenly out of the gloom.  The stream flowed down into a darkriver of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched overwith willows, blocked with fallen willows, flecked with thousandsof faded willow leaves, and otherwise heavily bewillowed.  The lateafternoon sun shone golden through the break in the trees,illuminating a faint footpath running along the bank of the river.    "Well, I know precisely where we are," said Morrie, speakingquickly before any more comments about his navigational abilitiesmight be made.  "This is the River Witherwander!  We have strayedjust a little from our path."  Pipsqueak looked about to protest,but Morrie spoke on unheeding.  "Perhaps there is some truth tothose old stories about the trees moving of their own accord afterall.  They could have cut off our path and herded us here.  Thatmust be it."    Seeing nothing else for it, the hobbits filed out and Morrieled them down to the riverside.  There they stopped to water theponies and take a brief rest.  The long ride had worn them down andthe soft grass beneath the willow trees was a welcome change ofseating as they refilled their own water bottles.  They yawned,lightly at first, weariness seeming to creep over them now thatthey could take a break at last.    Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod.  Off to his sideMorrie and Pipsqueak had wandered over to a great knotted oldwillow and were resting against it.  Sam had stopped, pretty muchwhere his pony had, and sat blinking stupidly about himself.    Frodo felt that some cool water might help revive him andwandered towards the riverbank, half in a daze.  He did not evenknow he had reached the riverbank until he tripped over a root ofthe old willow and fell headfirst into the water with a greatsplash.  He broke back to the surface a moment later, gasping andsputtering.  "Help!  Help!", he cried, as he attemptedineffectually to reach the shore.  As the slow current carried himaway Frodo could see his friends half stirring in response to hiscries, but then settling back into weary sleep.    Choking now and fearing he would follow his parents into awatery grave Frodo thought he dimly heard a voice as he drifted outof sight and conciousness: a deep glad voice, singing carelesslyand happily:            Hey doll!  merry doll!  ring a ding dial-O!            Ring a ding!  hop along!  follow the willow!            Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadildo!    With a last gasp of effort Frodo kicked himself to the surfaceof the water and cried out once more before sinking beneath thesurface.  He felt the cold darkness settle over him, and knew nomore.    Until a moment later when he was pulled coughing and sputteringfrom the water by strong hands.  He hung helplessly, spitting upwater and a tragically large portion of his breakfast, before hecould begin to breathe normally again and get his first clear lookat his rescuer.    It was a man, or so he seemed.  At any rate he was too largeand heavy for an ordinary hobbit, if not quite tall enough for oneof the Big People.  He had a long brown beard; his eyes were blueand bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple.  He wore yellowboots, a blue coat and a battered hat with a tall crown and a longblue feather stuck in the band.  In his free hand (Frodo wasdangling precariously from the other) he carried on a large leaf ason a tray a pile of white water-lilies and a small doll.  Frodofound himself noting that the doll looked much like the manhimself, save that its hat seemed to sport a peacock feather ratherthan a kingfisher.    "Whoa! steady there!" cried the old man, and Frodo stoppedsquirming as if he had been struck stiff.  "Now, my little fellow.Where be you a-going to, breathing like a fish?  What's the matterhere then?  Do you know who I am?  I'm Tom Bombadil."    "My friends and I were lost.  I fell in the water and they allwent to sleep.  I could have drowned!" cried Frodo breathlessly.    "What?" shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air and givingFrodo quite a jolt.  "Friends napping when help is being needed?Let's go and see this."  He set Frodo down and they made their wayback up the path to where the other hobbits were sleeping.    Tom let out a great laugh and sang a bit of his nonsense rhyme,though Frodo looked fit to boil.  The three hobbits woke and satup, rubbing thier eyes at this strange apparition.    "Frodo!" cried Sam, seeing his master all wet and bedraggled."What happened?"    "What happened?" yelled Frodo with some heat.  "I nearlydrowned while you three had a nice nap."    The three jumped up, all trying to explain at once:  "We werebespelled!", "The sleep...", "I just closed my eyes for a moment!","Why'd you go fall in the water anyway..."    Looking around Sam suddenly pointed at the great grey willowunder which they had all slept.  "That... that there willow, itmust be one of those walking trees.  I'd bet it put us all to sleepI would!"  The others gaped and then nodded quickly in agreement.    Tom regarded the hobbits with great amusement and laughedagain.  "Oh, the old 'willow-man' was it?  Well, that's as may be,but Tom Bombadil must be going.  You should all come home with me.The table is laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white breadand butter.  Goldberry is waiting.  You follow me as quick as youare able."  With that he gave a beckoning wave and went hopping anddancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly andnonsensically.      Hey!  Come merry doll!  daring doll!  My darling!      Hop along little friends, up the Witherwander.      Tom's going on ahead to get the ponies fodder.      Goldberry will make the beds and set the board,      With bread and honey and sweet delights, the River daughter.      Hey now!  merry doll!  We'll be waiting for you!    They all stared after him for a long moment, but the promise offood and good beds would draw any hobbit.  And so they startedafter him, still arguing amongst themselves:    "You know, now that I think of it... that willow root thattripped me DID seem to move of its own accord."    "I think he was an entwife," opined Pipsqueak.    "A what?"    "An entwife.  Old Bilbo told me a story about them... no, notone of THOSE stories."    Up ahead the trees parted and a house lay beneath the darkshapes of the Barrow-downs.  Golden light spilled out over thethreshold and they hurried forward.
     The four hobbits stepped over the threshold and stoodstill, gaping. In a chair sat a woman; she wore nothing morethan a bathrobe, her long yellow hair tangled in an unrulymess. It was obvious from her tired look that this lady hadlistened to more silly songs than was bearable. It was alsoobvious that Tom had good taste where women were concerned. The opposite wasn't certain at all.      When she saw them she shrieked. "Ahh! You didn't tellme you were bringing friends!" then promptly turned on heralluring smile. "Come in! Laugh and be merry!" she said.      Morrie gave her a humorless look. "Madam, I'm aBrandybuck. We don't do 'merry'."      Generally speaking, those with a problem distinguishingthe two pronunciations quickly found themselves facing much moreimportant problems indeed.      Frodo spoke. "Fair lady Goldberry! Now I know whatBombadil was talking about when he said that you'll makethe boards and make the beds." Then he stopped as herealised that may have not sounded as well as heintended.      Her smile faded. "Oh, he said that, didn't he? I knewI should have never left my mother. I admit her place wasrather watery, but this man..."      "Fair lady!" said Frodo quickly, knowing that in adomestic dispute the guests were also bound to suffer. "Tellme, if it hasn't been discussed over and over again, whois Tom Bombadil? Is he a Maia that went native? Is heperhaps an authorial self-insertion? Is he Eru, GodAlmighty?"      Goldberry snorted.      "Mainly, he's a very bad singer."      Before long they were all seated at the table, twohobbits on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry andTom (whose insistence at being called Master threatened tobring about a new domestic quarrel). The hobbits ate asonly famished hobbits can, and before the dinner's end,Pipsqueak had to wrestle with Sam over the remnants ofa cake. The guests became suddenly aware that they wereall shouting at the top of their lungs.      At last the table was cleared. Goldberry came andwished them a good night.      "Have peace now," she said, "until the morning! Andheed no nightly noises - especially if they are comingfrom our bedroom."      Tom sat on a while beside them in silence and atlast Frodo spoke:      "Did you hear me calling, To - eh.. Master, or wasit just chance that brought you at that moment?"      "Nay, I didn't hear. I was too busy singing. And I wastoo busy admiring this really beautiful doll of myself, sinceI'm really as self-centered and self-absorbed as can be."      With a glance at his friends, Frodo asked, "Tell us aboutthe willow-man. What is he? And how can it be I neverheard of him before?"      "No, don't!" said Morrie and Pipsqueak togetherthen looked embarassed. "I mean it will give poor Frodonightmares for sure," went on Morrie.      Tom laughed, and after a couple of accusatory looksamong the hobbits, they all went to bed.      Frodo dreamt that night of a pinnacle of stone ontop of which the figure of a man stood. Suddenly a shadowlike the shape of wings passed across the moon at whichthe man shouted "YOU ARE NOT A BALROG!"      Pipsqueak lay dreaming pleasantly, but suddenly hewoke - he still heard in the darkness the sound that haddisturbed his dream 'tip-tap, squeak'. Thinking someonewas calling his name, he stood up groggily. The noiseseemed to come from Bombadil and Goldberry's room.Tip-toeing he approached the half-open door and triedto take a peep inside: Goldberry was hitting Tom overthe head with his own miniature while Tom said thingslike "But, dearest--". Pipsqueak gave a grunt of disgustand went back to bed.      Goldberry looked up at the grunt. "Was he peepin'?"      Tom, glad at the small reprieve, rubbed his bruisedhead. "No, I think he was Pipsqueak."      It was the sound of Shirrifs coming that Morrie thoughthe heard while asleep. But then he seemed to hear or rememberhearing: "Nothing passes doors or windows without a properwarrant." He breathed deep and fell asleep again.      As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the nightin deep content, if logs that chased and then happily savagedtheir imperialistic masters are contented.      Next day Tom told them many remarkable stories,sometimes as if speaking the himself, sometimes lookingat them suddenly with a bright blue eye (the other eyehad been mysteriously blackened during the previousnight). Often his voice would turn to song, and thehobbits would simply shut their ears and pray it wouldpass.      After a couple of truly dull horror stories about the OldForest, suddenly Tom's talk left the wood and using aconvoluted course seemed to rest on the Downs. Tomtold them of the Barrow-wights who walked in the hollowplaces always happily ready to provide a side adventurefor tired travelers.      The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumourof the Barrow-wights and their liking for plotwise-insignificantside-adventures had been heard. The did not make a talethat any hobbit liked to listen to, since they mainly preferredfocused narratives. They (inevitably) lost the thread of histale.      When they caught his words again they found that hehad now wandered into strange places beyond theirmemory, waking thought or even their hallucinations,into times when the world was carried on the back of aturtle and the seas flowed straight down in an endlesswaterfall; and still Tom went singing out into such timesas only ancient myths described, when people left thedoors unlocked at night, and even further back, whenthose damn kids knew some proper respect for theirparents. Then suddenly he stopped, and they saw thathe nodded as if he had bored even himself to sleep.      "Who are you, Master?" Frodo asked, sudden fearin his voice.      "Gnnngshm..?" Tom seemed to mumble and hefinally fell asleep with a good thump.      After supper Goldberry once again hurried awayfrom the table, because Tom now seemed wide awakeagain and plied them with questions.      He appeared already to know more about them andall their families, which caused extreme embarrassmentto all of them, and not a little worry from Morrie. Tommade no secret that he owed his secret knowledge toFarmer Maggot whom he seemed to regard as a personof more importance than they had imagined: "He has abig bank account, and quite a few connections; and fromthe Entwives' aging wood, he made worthy logs." It wasalso clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves of Gildorwhich caused exclamations of sudden understanding fromall of the hobbits. "Before I saw him, I thought that the Elveswere High." said Sam and Frodo agreed.      Indeed so much did Tom know, that Frodo foundhimself describing in greater detail his escapades withCassiopeia Took than was generally considered polite.While Pipsqueak was hurriedly trying to take notes on hisnapkin, Tom's eyes glinted.      "Show me the precious Ring!" he said suddenly in themidst of the story; and to Frodo's astonishment Tomsimply reached his hand and painfully yanked the chainfrom Frodo's neck.      He juggled it from one hand to the other, while Frodotried ineffectually to stop him. In the end Tom spun theRing in the air and it vanished with a flash. Then Tomleaned forward and reached his hand behind Frodo'sear. "Here it is -- hey, where did it go?"      In the end the hobbits had to go and search the housefor it. They only found it five hours later, inside the hollowminiature of Tom's self. "Those magic rings - you can'ttrust the little rascals." Tom said with a laugh, and notwithout a hint of disappointment for the success of thesearch.      Tom gave them a lot of suggestions about how theyshould travel the next day: "Keep on the right of the road - and mind the traffic. Don't you speak with Barrow-wights or take rides with strangers." Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck meet a side-adventure.        Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadildo!        By water, wood and hill, by an armadillo        by fire, sun and moon, by the heat and frost        Come, Tom Bombadil, or we'll now be toast.When they had sung this, he clapped them each on theshoulder and taking candles led them back to their beds.
  That night they heard no noises.  But either in his dreams or out ofthem, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running inhis mind:  a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a greyrain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass andsilver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country openedbefore him under a swift sunrise.  The vision melted, and Frodo awoke feeling a rather depressing senseof predestination.  Everything is fixed, and you can't change it,echoed the ethereal chorus in his memory.  "You're a fool, Frodo Baggins," muttered Frodo, shaking his head andlooking about for some sign of breakfast.  Instead, Sam was immediatelyat his side, stroking Frodo's hand, kissing Frodo's hand, and suckingFrodo's fingers, as was his wont.  "Good boy, Sam," praised Frodo,tossing Sam a scooby-snack.  "How about some breakfast, then?"  After breakfast, the four Hobbits made ready to say farewell to theirhost.  Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, shimmying and shaggingrestlessly.  Tom came out of the house and waved his doll and dancedupon the doorstep, bidding the Hobbits to go speedily and reminding themto beware of the dread Barrow-wights that haunted the Downs at night."They're always after my lucky charms!" he explained.  Duly warned, the Hobbits thanked Tom for his advice and trotted theirpanting ponies away, in haste to be out of hearing range before Tomstarted singing again.  They rode off along a path that wound away frombehind the house, and went slanting up and over a high, green hill.They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the steep slope, whensuddenly Frodo stopped.  "Goldberry!" he cried.  "My fair lady, clad all in terrycloth!  Wehave never said farewell to her, nor seen her since that evening!"  Hewas so distressed that he turned back.  Morrie rolled his eyes.  "No wonder he's still a virgin," he muttered.  "What?" exclaimed Pipsqueak, looking sharply at Morrie.  "Am not," shot back Frodo.  "Are too," Morrie snidely insisted.  "Now see here--" began Sam, but Pipsqueak cut him off.  "Whatever do you mean, Morrie?  What about Cassiopiea,and...well...and...well, what about Cassiopiea?"  "For the love of Elbereth!" implored Frodo.  "Please, you two, justdrop it!"  "Yes, I hear you're quite adept at dropping it, cousin," sneeredMorrie.  He raised an eyebrow and glanced significantly at Pipsqueak.  Pipsqueak gasped.  "You mean--?"  He glanced at Frodo, who at themoment could easily have been mistaken for a poppy in Farmer Maggot'sfields, and grinned back at Morrie.  "Go on!" he said, laughing.  "It's true," said Morrie.  "'Limp as last night's noodles left out inthe rain,' is how your cousin Cassie put it."  "Well, then, whyever did she keep--ohhh, the power of the Ring, Isuppose."  "Yes, poor Cassie.  Apparently the Ring only bestows the power toseduce; the power to perform is up to the wearer."  "Enough!" cried Frodo, his face contorted in anguish.  "All right!  Iadmit it!  I can't--perform with a lass.  I don't know why; it's notthat I haven't tried.  Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to bethe only fifty-year-old virgin in all of Hobbiton?"  "The Shire."  "What!" snapped Frodo defensively.  "The Shire," Morrie drolly repeated, smirking.  "As far as I know,you're the only fifty-year-old virgin in the whole of the Shire."  "Including Bucklebeltland," suggested Pipsqueak helpfully.  "For that matter, Frodo, you're probably the only virgin over thirtyin all the Shire--"  "Including Buckle--"  "I take your point!"  Frodo stalked off up and over the hill.  "Now see what you've done," reproved Sam, jabbing a finger intoPipsqueak's chest.  "Sam, please," sniffed Morrie, swatting Sam's hand away fromPipsqueak.  "It's not proper to treat your betters in so familiar afashion."  "Never you mind 'proper,' Mr. Moribund, sir.  You and Mr. Paragraphhere made poor Mr. Frodo feel bad, and I'll not be standing for it, andthat's a fact!"  Morrie and Pipsqueak burst into laughter.  "Well, then," leeredMorrie, as Sam scowled and stamped his foot in protest, "why don't yougo find poor Mr. Frodo and make him feel gooood,Sammy-Sammy-Sam-Saaammmm?"  "Maybe I'll do just that," retorted Sam, who wouldn't recognizesubtext if it smacked him upside the head.  As if to further prove thepoint, he shouted, "Coming, Mr. Frodo!  Coming!" while Morrie andPipsqueak fell to the grass, rolling and laughing hysterically.  Damn the lot of them.  Frodo grinned to himself.  It sounded so fine, he said it aloud:"Damn the lot of them!"  (To say that Frodo was socially retardedwould be somewhat of an understatement.)  Damn them all.  He ought to cast them all to the dread Barrow-wightsand invite the beasts to have at their lucky charms.  Frodo imagined hisso-called friends lying dead and dismembered, while he himself escaped,alive and free.  Gandalf would admit there had been nothing else hecould do.  Just then a familiar, low voice interrupted his sadistic reverie:"Mr. Frodo, sir?"  Not Sam, amended Frodo.  Morrie and Pipsqueak, without a regret, butnot Sam.  "Yes, Sam," he said, turning and smiling fondly; for suddenlyit struck him that he was, indeed, very fond of the young Hobbit.  Sam blushed and lowered his gaze.  "Aw, Mr. Frodo, I was thinking,maybe, you could use a bit of cheering up."  He took Frodo's hand intohis own, held it up to his cheek.  "You always do like it when I holdyour hand," he said shyly.  "I do, indeed," said Frodo, caressing Sam's cheek with his fingertips."However did you get in the habit of doing it, anyway?"  "Oh, I don't know, sir."  Sam shrugged, and slipped his mouth over thenearest fingertip.  "Maybe it's just you have such beautiful hands."  A shadow fell over Frodo's face.  "Morrie said I'm ugly," he said,looking away. "You never were," protested Sam.  "Why, you're the fairest Hobbit inall the Shire, as beautiful as any Elf."  "Really?" Frodo glanced back doubtfully at Sam.  "Really and truly, sir.  Mr. Morrie's just jealous, on account that helooks like the wrong end of a pony with a bad case of the Bywaterblasts."  Frodo burst out laughing.  "You always could make me laugh, dear Sam,"he said, leaning against Sam.  "Aw."  Again the color rose in Sam's face.  "He just knows he can'thold a candle to you, and that's--"  He stopped short, suddenlyself-conscious.  "A fact?"  Frodo's eyes shone brightly at Sam.  Sam glanced up at him,and nodded.  "Fact is, sir, I always wondered how it was so handsome aHobbit never did wed--oh, I'm sorry, sir!" cried Sam, aghast.  Frodo winced, but patted Sam's hand reassuringly, bestowing a lightkiss upon it for good measure.  "It's all right, Sam," he said.  "I seemto be cursed, doomed by forces beyond my control never to know the blissof conjugal relations."  Sighing wistfully, Frodo lifted his eyes to thehills; whence would come his help?  "Well, come along, Sam."  Frodo looked back to Sam, and gave him ashadowed smile.  "I suppose we'd better find Morrie and Pipsqueak and beheading out of here before it gets dark.  They may be asses, but theyare my cousins, all the same."  "And they may prove useful yet, sir," added Sam, walking hand in handwith Frodo back over the hill to where they had left Morrie andPipsqueak.  Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and thescent of turf, lying a little too long after lunch to linger overbottles of elderberry wine, sucked drop by drop from slender fingers:these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened.  Howeverthat may be, the Hobbits woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleepthey never meant to take.  Extricating their entwined limbs, they sprangto their feet in alarm:  The setting sun throbbed crimson as it sankbelow the horizon.  Red sky at night, sailor's delight, hissed thewind, chilling the companions to their very bones.  In defiance of all principles of meteorology, known and unknown, athick fog rolled in from nowhere, quickly enshrouding the Hobbits andisolating them one from another.  "Sam?" called Frodo shakily.  "Sam?  Morrie?  Pipsqueak?"  He thought he heard a dim, answering call of Frodo but he could notbe sure.  "Sam?  Sam, where are you?  Morrie, Pipsqueak?  Please answerme!  Where are you?"  Blindly he stumbled through the fog and the dark,his curls plastered damply against his brow.  Hey sailorrrrr....  Frodo halted.  "Sam?" he queried in a quavering voice.  Hey, sailor, where are you going?  "Who are you?" demanded Frodo.  "And what have you done with Sam?"Falling silent, he waited, but there was no answer, only the slither ofthe wind beneath the fog.  "Sam!  Where are you?" Frodo cried out miserably.  There was no reply.  He was suddenly aware that it was getting verycold, and the wind was growing stronger, dispersing the mists asimprobably quickly as they had descended.  A glance showed him that hewas now standing on a high hilltop, which he must have climbed in hisfrantic chase, which would explain why his clothes and hair were soakedwith perspiration.  Out of the east a biting wind was blowing.  To hisright there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape.  Agreat barrow stood there.  "Where are you?" he cried again, both angry and afraid.  "Here!" said a voice deep and mellow and strangely seductive.  "I amwaiting for you!"  "No!" said Frodo; but he did not run away.  Trembling, he looked up tosee a tall, dark, and handsome figure silhouetted against the stars.  Itleaned over him, and Frodo felt his knees grow weak.  He thought he sawan appraising glimmer in the two pale eyes gazing intently down into hisown, and he stood transfixed, silently yearning for he knew not what.Then strong, manly hands seized him, and a body hard as iron boreagainst him, pressing him insistently to the ground, and he rememberedno more.  He awoke feeling curiously sticky, and, even more curiously, strangelysatiated.  He had no desire to move, but was content to lie as he foundhimself:  naked, on the ground, his clothes scattered around him, acrushed cigarette butt smoldering in a bare patch of dirt.  LanguidlyFrodo reached over and twisted the cigarette butt into the ground,snuffing it.  Hmm.  He'd never been one for smoking, but now he felt a sudden andpowerful craving for a good pipe full of weed.  Damn.  Frodo supposedthat he would have to bestir himself to find where his companions hadgot to; Sam alone could be counted on to pack half a year's crop of leafwhenever he undertook so much as a trip to the post office.  Hopefully,thought Frodo, he hadn't smoked it all by now.  Groaning, he stretched and sat up and set about reclothing himself,pausing to wipe off the curiously sticky night dew which had condensedupon certain regions of his skin.  He looked about in vain for his pony.Double-damn.  "Sam!  Morrie!  Pipsqueak!" called Frodo.  "Where are you?  Sam!Morrie!  Pipsqueak!  Hullo!  Rise and shine!  Here comes the sun, and Isay, it's all right!"  From the barrow emerged Sam, Morrie, and Pipsqueak, blinking, bemused,and naked as the day they were born.  "Mr. Frodo?" murmured Sam, gazingblearily in Frodo's direction.  "Mr. Frodo, I had the queerest dream."  "Hm.  So did I," said Frodo, straining to hold back a wide grin.  "Isay, Sam, you wouldn't happen to have any pipeweed about you, wouldyou?"  "Pipeweed?" repeated Sam.  "You, sir?  I mean, begging your pardon,sir, but no, it's in my pack, on the pony--"  Sam snapped to, lookedabout, as if only then becoming cognizant of their situation.  "Nowwhere in tarnation are those ponies, anyway?  And why am I standing herein my birthday suit--why, and Mr. Pipsqueak--and Mr. Morrie, too!"  "Don't fret, Sam; it suits you well," laughed Frodo.  Then Frodosuddenly blushed, and wondered why.  "Well, it doesn't suit me at all!" cried Pipsqueak indignantly.  "Wemust find our ponies, and our packs.  Either that or you must lend ussome of your clothing, Frodo."  "I haven't any to lend, except what I'm wearing," said Frodo.  "I amafraid my pony has likewise wandered, and with it my pack."  "Oh, this is terrible!" wailed Pipsqueak.  "We can't go walking toBree stark naked!"  "Hm," said Morrie, pointedly regarding Pipsqueak's nether regions."Those of us with a little more to show off have no reason to beembarrassed."  "Even I am not lacking in that respect," Frodo observed.  "Thank you very much, noble cousin."  Pipsqueak crossed his arms andsulked.  "Payback's a bitch," grunted Sam, thrusting his hips forward so tobetter show off his considerable assets.  "Now, Sam," chided Frodo teasingly, "there's no need to flaunt it.Anyway, none of this is helping us to find the ponies; I suppose we'llhave to call on Tom Bombadil again."  "Oh, no," groaned Pipsqueak.  "Here."  Frodo reached into his pocket and produced a handkerchief."Cover up," he said, handing it to Pipsqueak.  Pipsqueak glowered at him, but he took the handkerchief, all the same."Thank you," he sullenly muttered.  Meanwhile, Frodo cupped his handsabout his mouth and called out:       Ho!  Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!       The ground makes a cold bed, and stones a hard pillow!       Our ponies have wandered!  Bring your help near       So we can high-tail it out of here!  And, sure as deus ex machina is a fantasy writer's best friend, camethe answering call:       Old Tom Bombadil is a merry old fellow!       There's simply no end to the things he does know!       Come, ponies, and fly to your bareback riders!       Bring backpacks with breeches to cover backsiders!  Morrie and Pipsqueak exchanged erudite expressions of aesthetic angst,but Sam was simply delighted.  "Sheer poetry," he sighed, beamingblissfully.  Laughing and singing, Tom Bombadil greeted the Hobbits."Run naked in the grass, my merry friends, and let the light of day warmheart and limb!  Run naked, run naked, I say!  Cast away that thin rag,"he whipped the handkerchief from Pipsqueak's clutching hands, "and runnaked, I say!"  A rather curious thing to exhort of grown men, one would think, yetFrodo and Sam and Morrie and Pipsqueak followed Bombadil's directivewithout question.  Frodo again cast his clothing aside, running aboutnude with his friends under the morning sun because, we are given tounderstand, it is the natural thing for Hobbits to be so carefree andinnocent and unashamed, even though heretofore we have been led tobelieve that Shire Hobbits were quintessential starched-and-buttonedVictorian Brits who were as likely as Queen Victoria herself to be foundcavorting naked in the grass.  "And here are your ponies!" said Bombadil, as the ponies trotted gailyover the crest of the hill behind him, each running to its respectiverider.  The Hobbits opened their packs and clothed themselves, whileBombadil gave them directions to the road that would lead them to Bree."And in Bree you will find an old brothel called The Prancing Pony;Barliman Butterball is its worthy keeper, and his buxom wife Bella thefetching mistress of the house.  There you will find food and drink, anda warm fire, and a warm wench or two to keep you the night; and themorning will speed you on your way.  Be bold, but wary!  Keep gay yourhearts, and ride to meet your fortune!"  Then he turned and tossed uphis doll and caught it again, leaping and skipping and dancing away backover the hill whence he had come.  "Well, Mr. Frodo," remarked Sam, "I am sorry to take leave of MasterBombadil, but I won't deny I'll be glad to see this brothel he spoke of.I wonder if it'll be like the Green Dragon back home?  D'you supposethey have Hobbit wenches, or only wenches of the Big Folk?"  "There are Hobbits in Bree," said Morrie, "as well as Big Folk.  Takeyour pick!  I myself have partaken of both varieties, with perfectsatisfaction."  "Well, now, Mr. Frodo," Sam heartily exclaimed.  "This Prancing Ponymight just be the place to turn your luck for the better!  I daresayyou'll no longer be a virgin on the morrow."  "Be that as it may," Frodo sharply hissed, "please, please watchyour tongues, and remember not to mention that I have never known awoman in conjugal embrace!"  "Oh, no, of course not, Mr. Frodo.  Right, Mr. Morrie?  Mr.Pipsqueak?"  "Oh, certainly.  Of course."  They snickered, and began to sing ribaldsongs as they rode toward the soft, sultry red lights of Bree.
    Bree was the chief village of Bree-land, a small country a few milesbroad whose chief claim to fame was its aluminum siding industry.  TheMen of Bree were cheerful and independant: they belonged to nobody butthemselves.  In the lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers.The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and being unlettered hicks for themost part knew nothing of their origins.  They were believed to havestrange powers of sight and hearing, and so the Bree-folk thought thatthey were the ones who secretly ran the local psychic telephone hotline.When they appeared, they brought strange news from afar, but since theydidn't buy siding, the Bree-folk did not make friends of them.    There were also many families of Hobbits in Bree-land.  The Big 'Unsand the Little 'Uns (as they called one another) were on friendly terms,both regarding each other as necessary parts of the Bree-folk.  Nowhereelse was this peculiar (but politically correct) arrangement to befound.    The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not travel much.  Occasionally,the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Beltbuckleland or Eastfarting, thoughthe Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited.  An occasionalBeltbucklelander or adventurous Took would come out to buy some siding,but that was becoming less usual.    The village of Bree had some hundred houses of the Big 'Uns, all withaluminum siding, awnings and doors.  It was dark when Frodo and hiscompanions came to the West-gate and found it shut.  The gatekeeperjumped up and looked at them in surprise.    "Who the hell are you?" he asked gruffly.    "We are making for the inn," answered Frodo.  "We are journeying tothe east."    "Hobbits!  And from the Shire by their talk," the gatekeeper said tohimself.  He stared at them darkly, and then opened the gate.    "You'll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east ofBree!  What may your names be, might I ask?"    "Our names and our business are our own," said Frodo, not liking thenosiness of the man.    "No doubt," said the man, "But I'm supposed to ask questions afternightfall."    "We are Hobbits from Beltbuckleland, and we feel like staying at theinn here,"  said Morrie.  "I am Mr. Brandybuck.  And why don't you mindyour own damn business?"    "All right, all right!" said the man.  "I meant no offense, butthere's queer folk about, not that there's anything wrong with that."    Frodo wondered why the man was so suspicious, and wondered if anyonehad been asking about a party of Hobbits.  Could it be Gandalf, orperhaps his creditors? As soon as the gatekeeper's back was turned, adark figure climbed over the gate and into the shadows of the village.        The Hobbits rode on up a slope and drew together outside the inn.  Samstared up at the inn with its aluminum siding and felt his heart sank.He had imagined meeting terrifying creatures, but at the moment he wasfinding his first sight of Men and their aluminum houses to be quiteenough.  He pictured fierce, warlike elf-maidens peering out the out ofdark upper windows.    "We surely aren't going to stay here, are we?" he exclaimed.  "Maybewe could stay with some Hobbits.  It would be more homelike."    "What's wrong with it?" asked Frodo.  "Tom Bombadil recommended it.I expect it's homelike enough."     Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant home to familiareyes.  A sign above the door pictured a fat white pony rearing on itshind legs.  Over the door was painted the letters:  THE PRANCING PONY byBARLIMAN BUTTERBALL.  They climbed up the steps.  Frodo went forward andnearly bumped into a short, grossly overweight man with a bald head andsweaty red face.    "Can we --" began Frodo.    "Half a minute, if you please!"  shouted the man.  He dissapearedinto the tavern, and reemerged a moment later, wiping his hands on hisgreasy apron."    "Good evening, little master," he said, bending down.  Morrie andPipsqueak giggled and chortled at "little master", but Frodo glared atthem and they shut up.    "We'd like beds for four, and stabling for five ponies," Frodo said."Are you Mr. Butterball?"    "That's right," he said.  "Barliman Butterball at your service.You're from the Shire, eh?  Now what does that remind me of?  Might Iask your names, sir?"    "Mr. Took, and Mr. Brandybuck," said Frodo.  "This is Sam Gamgee,and I am Mr. Underhill."    "There now," said Butterball, "it's gone again!  Well, it'll comeback as soon as I have a chance to think."    Butterball showed them to their rooms and prepared them a dinner ina private parlor, which was served to them by his wife, Bella.  As hewas leaving, he invited them to join the company in the common room whenthey were finished.    They felt refreshed and encouraged after thier meal, and Frodo, Samand Pipsqueak decided to join the company.  Morrie, having learned longago the value of keeping a low profile, decided to stay behind, andperhaps go out later for soem fresh air.    The company was in the large common room of the inn.  It was large andmixed as Frodo discovered as his eyes adjusted to the light.  BarlimanButterball was talking to a group of dwarves near the fire.  On thebenches were various folk: the local drunks for the most part, but alsomore dwarves and other figures in the shadowy corners.    The local folk, having drunk a few pints already, cheered theShire-hobbits as they entered the room, but the strangers, especiallythe ones from the South, stared at them curiously.  Butterballintroduced them to the crowd.  The Men of Bree seemed to have strange,meaty names like Oscar-meyer, Hatfield, Weaver, Tyson, and Sandyman (notto mention Butterball).  However, the Hobbits had much more naturalnames, like Banks, Bigholes, Earthmovers, and Digger, many of which wereused in the Shire.  There even some Underhills, who immediately took toFrodo as a long-lost cousin.    Frodo said that he was interested in history and geography, but gotmany blank stares, as the Bree-folk were uneducated and such wordsweren't in their vocabulary.  The Hobbits went over to Pipsqueak andasked him all sorts of questions about the Shire, leaving Frodo to sitin the corner by himself.    The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking  of distant events.  Therewas trouble away in the South, and the Men who had come up the Greenwaywere on the move looking for lands were they could find peace.  TheBree-folk were sympathetic, but since poor refugees seldom have moneyfor siding and other home improvements, they didn't want them around.One traveller, a squint-eyed ill-favored fellow was foretelling thatmore people would be coming north in the near future.  He went on and onabout squatters' rights, and local folk were not pleased.    The hobbits were not as concerned, since Big 'Uns could hardly begfor lodgings in hobbit-holes.  They were more interested in Pipsqueakand Sam's tales of the Shire.  Pipsqueak roused a great deal of laughterwith an account of the collapse of the Town Holes in Michel Delving:Will Whitfoot, the mayor and fattest hobbit in the Shire, had beenburied in his hidden stash of cocaine, and came out looking like afloured dumpling.    Then Frodo noticed that a strange-looking flabby man sitting in theshadows was also listening intently to the Shire talk.    "Who is that?" Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr.Butterball.  "I don't think you introduced him."    "Him?" said the landlord.  "I don't really know.  He is one of thewandering folk -- Rangers we call them.  What his right name is I'venever heard, but he's known around here as Strider."    Frodo found that Strider was looking at him, and he beckoned forFrodo to come closer.    "I am called Strider," he said in a low voice.  I am pleased tomeet you,  Master Underhill.  If I were you, I would stop your youngfriends from talking too much."    Frodo noticed that Strider's attention was focused on Pipsqueak.  Tohis alarm, Frodo noticed that the ridiculous young Took was now talkingabout Bilbo's farewell.  He was giving a good imitation of the speech,and was now drawing close to the astonishing Appearance.    Frodo was annoyed.  It would bring the name of Baggins the minds ofthe locals, especially if there had been inquiries in Bree about thename.    Frodo fidgeted, unsure what to do.  Pipsqueak, unmindful of thedanger, finished the speech, then he jumped up on a table, tore off hisshirt, and started to gyrate his hips wildly.    "You'd better do something quick!" whispered Strider.    Frodo jumped up onto another table.  Some of the hobbits looked athim and laughed, thinking he had taken as much ale as was good for him.    He felt nervous, and began to fondle the things in his pockets as hedid when making a speech.  He felt the Ring on its chain, and quitesuddenly he felt a desire to slip it on and prove his manhood withBella.  It seemed to him, somehow, that the suggestion came to him fromsomeone or something in the room.   He resisted the temptation firmly.He spoke a few words, then hesitated and coughed.    Everyone was now looking at him.  "A song!" shouted one of thehobbits.  "A song, a song!" shouted all the others.  For a moment hehesitated, and then one of Bilbo's silly old songs came to mind:      Hey diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle,      The cow jumped over the moon.       The little dog cried to see such sport,      And the dish ran away with the spoon.Though since Westron had a lot more words than Modern English, the songwas quite a bit longer than that.    The applause was long and loud, and they called for an encore.   NowFrodo began to feel pleased with himself.  He danced on the table, andwhen he came to "the cow jumped over the moon" he leaped into the air.He slipped on a tray of mugs when he came down, and rolled off thetable.  The audience laughed when they saw his pants around his anklesexposing his flannel boxers with pink oliphaunts.    One swarthy Bree-lander looked at him with a mocking and knowingexpression, then slipped out the door with the squint-eyed southernerand the gatekeeper; they had been whispering together a great deal thatevening.    Frodo felt foolish.  Not knowing what to do, he pulled his pantsback up and took off the Ring.  How it came to be on his finger he couldnot tell.  He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.    "Well?"  said Strider.  "Why did you do that?  Worse than anythingyour friends could have said!  You have put your foot in it!  Or shouldI say your finger?  We better wait until the laughter dies down.  Then,if you please, Mr. _Baggins_, I should like a quiet word with you."    "Very well,"  said Frodo, "I'll talk to you later."      After the crowd left, Butterball came over to Frodo.  "I'm sorry if Icaused any trouble," Frodo said.  "It was quite unintentional.  We'll beleaving early tommorrow.  Could you have our ponies ready by eighto'clock?"    "Very good.  But before you go, I would like a word with you inprivate, Master Underhill.  Something has just come back to my mind thatI ought to tell you.  After I've seen to a thing or two, I'll come toyour room, if you're willing."    "Certainly," said Frodo, but his heart sank, wondering how manyprivate talks he has going to have before bed.  Were they against him?He even suspected fat Butterball's face of concealing dark designs.
     Frodo hurried the others ahead of him, anxious to get to thesafety of the parlour. Morrie had not yet arrived, but Frodolocked and barred the door anyway, worried about any creditorsthat might be seeking him. It was not until he had puffed up theembers of the fire that he discovered that Strider had somehowslipped ahead of them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair!     "You cannot escape me so easily," he said with a slow smile. "Youpromised to have a quiet talk with me, after all."     "What have you to say?" Frodo asked, alarmed.     "Several things," answered Strider. "But, of course, I have myprice." He looked at Frodo expectantly.     Several moments passed in silence.     "Well?" Strider said at last. "Will you not make me an offer?"     Frodo thought uncomfortably of his lost accounts. "I cannot," hesaid with reluctance. "All that I have now would hardly satisfy arogue, and I cannot spare any of it."     "Don't be ridiculous," Strider said. "You're a Baggins, no matterhow you try to pass yourself off as an Underhill. Everyone knowsthat you have plenty of money."     "Oh, indeed!" cried Frodo. "Well, that is no longer true. I amafraid that I have nothing to my name, save some small sparechange."     Strider laughed. "You are, of course, in jest."     "I am not."     Several more moments passed. Strider looked at the hobbits withnarrowed eyes.     "Are you serious?"     Frodo squirmed a little; but Pipsqueak answered readily. "Yes, heis!" he exclaimed. "Frodo has lost almost everything he owns,thanks to Gandalf."     Strider stared at them for a moment longer, then turned away indisgust. "This is NOT fair!" he shouted, glaring at the ceiling.     "Sorry," said a disembodied voice. "Take it up with the Heroes'Union."     "Don't think I won't," Strider muttered. "This is the fourthcharity case this year." He turned back to the hobbits and forceda smile on his face. "Very well, I will assist you for nothing."     "Who said we want your help?" blurted Sam. He did not the look ofthis pudgy, tall Man.     "You certainly need help from someone. That much is clear,"Strider answered. "Otherwise, you will never get out of Breealive, much less reach Rivendell. You are not my ideal choice oftravelling companions; but I see no other way to handle thematter. I hope we shall get to know one another better. When wedo, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of yoursong, Mr. Baggins. That little prank has made people notice you."     "It was sheer accident!" Frodo defended himself. "The Ringsomehow slipped onto my finger!"     "The Ring?" Strider said sharply. "You have not the Ring, Frodo.Why else did you fail to disappear?"     Frodo opened his mouth to protest, then shut it again. Striderwas right! The Ring should have made him invisible! He pulled thesmall circle of gold out of his pocket and examined it closely.It was a cheap imitation, not the real thing!     "Where is the Ring?" Strider demanded. "We cannot allow it to befound."     The hobbits looked at each other, then --     "Morrie!" they chorused.     "No wonder he slipped away!" Frodo exclaimed. "He has gone to usethe Ring himself."     "But Frodo's pants fell down," protested Pipsqueak. "Are you surethat wasn't the Ring's work?"     "Frodo is rather out of shape, is he not?" said Strider with acurl of his lip. "It is not surprising that his belt could nolonger bear to support his trousers."     "You're not in better shape yourself," Frodo retorted,embarrassed.     Strider looked down at his own ample middle and shrugged. "It isa disguise of sorts. No one expects the heir of Elendil to beoverweight."     "Who?"     "Elendil," Strider repeated. At the blank expression on thehobbits' faces, he tried again. "Isildur's eldest son? Lord ofthe Numenoreans? Come on, the kingdom of Arnor?"     Frodo shook his head. "Never heard of it," he said.     "Ridiculous! Haven't you even heard of the fabulous swords ofWesternesse?" Strider rummaged in his pack and withdrew severalsharp knives, long, shaped like the ears of an elf, and keen, ofmarvellous workmanship, damasked in red and gold. Each scabbardwas stamped in tiny black letters with the words, "MADE INFORNOST."     Frodo took one and turned it over in his hands, almost slicinghis palm open in the process. "They are beautiful blades," hesaid in wonder.     "Guaranteed to break undead wills, or your money back," saidStrider proudly. He paused in hope for a moment; but when thehobbits did not offer to pay, he sighed and leaned back in hischair.     "And Arwen wonders why I can't get any financial backing," hemuttered to himself. After a moment, he drew his hand across hisbrow. "Well, I have become accustomed to such treatment. So whatmust I do to convince you?"     "I don't know," Frodo admitted. "Why the disguise? Who are youreally? What do you know about the Ring, and how do you know it?"     Strider frowned. "Why should you believe my story, if you do nottrust me already? Still here it is --"     At that moment there was a knock on the door. The hobbits jumped at first, then realized it was only Butterball, bringing themcandles and cans of hot water. As Frodo opened the door, Striderwithdrew into a dark corner.     "I've come to bid you good night," Butterball began, his voicegrudging. Then, looking troubled, he withdrew a letter from hispocket. The parchment was crumpled and stained with jelly andhoney.     "I'm not a postman," he grumbled, "and Gandalf didn't offer memuch money to deliver this."     "Gandalf!" Frodo cried.     "Yes, Gandalf. Dratted old wizard! Still, I don't need himputting curses on his beer; I'm a busy man, with no time or moneyto spare for having hexes removed. So here, take this letter.Gandalf left it here yesterday morning for a Mr. Baggins."     "But I told you my name is Underhill," Frodo interrupted.     Butterball frowned. "Do you really think anyone was fooled?Everyone knows 'Sharkey' Baggins. And if I was you, Mr. Baggins,I'd be paying a tidy sum more for the chance of a peaceful nightwithout anyone bothering you, if you know what I mean."     Frodo did not bother to try to explain that he was currentlybroke. He snatched the letter out of Butterball's hands andhastily shoved him out the door.     "What do we do now?" Frodo asked wildly. "Butterball's threatsare clear enough, and I don't have any money to give him!"     "Start by reading the letter," Strider advised, coming out of his dark corner.     Frodo examined the letter. It was written in Gandalf's usualillegible scrawl.   Dear Frodo,   Bad news has reached me here about your secret bank account   in Isengard. I must go off at once, and cannot wait for you   any longer. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through   Bree; the landlord (Butterball) is not very trustworthy, but   he won't cheat you much. You may meet a friend of mine on the   Road: a Man, tall, a bit overweight, dark, by some called   Strider. He knows our business and will help you, if you pay   him enough. Make for Rivendell. El Rond will advise you.   Yours in haste   GANDALF.          P.S. Why didn't you give me your account number? It would have   made things much easier.      P.P.S. Don't use IT again, or you'll be leaving behind a trail   of outraged husbands that will make it too easy to track you.      P.P.P.S. Make sure it is the real Strider. There are many strange   men on the roads, and most of them are overweight. His true   name is Aragon.        While all that is gold does not glitter,          The wandering folk can get lost;        The loss of a kingdom is bitter,          Especially when out in the frost.        For an elf-maid his ardor will be woken,          For her sake he'll do anything;        He can't fight with blade that is broken,          But who knows? He just might be king!      Frodo reread the letter, stunned that Gandalf had discovered his secret bank account and that even that money would be lost."Things are going from bad to worse," he groaned.     As Frodo passed the letter to Pipsqueak, Morrie furtively slipped into the room. Strider pounced on him immediately and wrested the Ring from him.     "Take it back," he snapped at Frodo, tossing the Ring at him,"and this time, keep an eye on it!"     Frodo fumbled with the chain, then slipped the Ring back into his pocket. "Why did you do something so foolish?" he cried toMorrie. "And how did you use it?"     "I didn't do much," Morrie defended himself. "Well, I went outfor a stroll --"     "I'll just bet you did," snorted Pipsqueak, glancing up from theletter.     Morrie glared at him, then looked at Strider. "Who is this?"     "That's what I want to know," said Sam, who had fidgeted silentlybeside his master during the confrontation with Strider. "I don'ttrust him." He glared at Strider. "What say you to that?"     "That you are an idiot," answered Strider. "If I was not whoI say I am, I could have easily overpowered you already. You havejust seen how I willingly gave the Ring back to your master. Infact, if I wanted to kill you all, I could do it -- NOW!"     He stood up, and suddenly seemed to grow taller and well-muscled.In his eyes gleamed a light, keen and feral. Throwing back hiscloak, he laid his hand on the hilt of a long sword that had hungconcealed by his side. Sam stared at it, horrified.     "But I am the real Strider, fortunately," he said, lookingdown at them with a suddenly kinder eye. He smiled. "I am alreadybetrothed to an elf-maid, and I have no need for the power of theRing. I am Aragon son of Arathon; and if I can save you from yourown stupid mistakes, then I will."     There was a long silence. Pipsqueak and Morrie stared at Strider with new-found respect at this revelation of his state.     "I think we will have to trust you," Frodo said at last. "What do you think we should do?"     "Stay here, and do not go to your rooms!" said Strider."Butterball sells an excellent beer, but he will also surely sellinformation about you to the highest bidder; and the location ofthe hobbit rooms in this inn are well known. We will all remaintogether here instead."     "So much for a comfortable bed," Sam said gloomily. "I don't like this, and that's a --"     "Will you stop that!" shouted Pipsqueak. He thumped Sam solidlyon the head.     Muttering to himself, Sam slouched into the corner and preparedfor bed.     Strider remained sitting by the fire, warming his hands asthe hobbits dropped off to sleep one by one. Once he was sure theywere snoring loudly, Strider rose noiselessly from his chair:swiftly and silently he rummaged through their belongings.     "So they were telling the truth about not having any money," hemumbled disappointedly. "Elendil! It looks like I'll have to takethem with me to Rivendell for nothing, after all."     Moodily drawing a bottle from Frodo's hidden stash ofWestfarthing Chinook, Strider returned to his chair by the doorto await the coming of the Sun.
     It was a raw night back in the Shire. Howling winds and sudden gusts of rain led to an atmosphere worthy of any particularly bad detective novel. Fredegar Bolger sat quietly in the house in Crickhollow, nursing his ninth Southfarthing Malt and chewing his fingernails in dread. Then, suddenly yet predictably, he heard a noise from outside: a squick, squick coming down the path, as if from waterlogged boots. Terror seized Fredegar. A heavy knock came on the door.     "Open, in the name of Arwen!" rang out a female voice.     "No, sorry, not buying, no visitors after ten," Fredegar said instinctively. "My mom locked the door and lost the key. Lease says no visitors. Sorry."     "I'm looking for a lone Ranger," said the voice.     "Can't help you," Fredegar stammered, missing all the obvious punchlines.     "Come on!" said the voice. "Let me in. I just want to dry off. Look, I'm two thousand years old and I'm really sexy."     Fredegar's mind was too preoccupied with terror to consider this. "Go away!" he shouted. "I'm not in. Leave a message with the building manager and we'll call you back in five working days or your pizza's free."     "I'm just trying to increase the size of my part, damn you!" the woman howled out in earnest. "There's a movie coming. Open up!"     Fredegar said nothing. The mysterious woman continued hammering at the door for several minutes, cursing beautifully-rounded epithets, until finally she gave up and left. Fredegar heard the squick, squick of her boots as she headed back towards Crickhollow. Her departure, however, did not cure his terror. He continued looking around the quiet room, looking for some nameless horror he could not yet identify.     After a time he heard a commotion from the stables at Brandy Hall.                          No Witnesses!     Fredegar leanded over the wooden table, peering towards the wood-silled windows. All outside was black until a flash of lightning illuminated the countryside. He could just make out a lithe figure in camouflage riding away on a stout horse. Some of the local Hobbits were dashing out with bows and arrows. It seemed less terrifying outside, somehow. The Horn-call of Bucklebeltland, unheard for over a hundred years except on gramophone, rang out again.               G-Men! Shirriffs! A Hit! No Witnesses!     In a flash Fredegar realized the source of his terror. Wood table, wood sill, wood-planked walls, floor and ceiling. He was surrounded by wood! Like being surrounded by trees, only more cunning! So they domesticated themselves, the evil bastards! And now we rely on them! Only a matter of time till they kill us all. It all made sense, that perfect kind of sense that only comes with excessive drinking. A dawn of understanding came to Fredegar. Visions of a brick house, with a stucco ceiling and wrought-iron patio furniture, came to him as visions of peace. No longer would anyone have to fear slivers! In a flash his purpose was clear. His mind resolved, Fredegar Bolger stood and went to the closet. Inside behind the bowling balls and collections of pocket lint was the great Axe. With a grim chuckle he hefted the steel-handled Axe over his shoulder and walked towards the door. There could be no compromise. Deforestation was the only answer.     Bolger smashed open the wooden door and walked into the night.     Frodo awoke from a deep sleep. Something heavy and pointed had rammed him im the side. He looked up to see Strider standing over him, holding a finger over his lips and making a shushing noise. With quick precision Strider went to each of Frodo's three companions, kicking each in turn with his steel-tipped boots and motioning them to silence. When he reached Morrie and kicked him Morrie instinctively sensed the movement and pulled a knife, motioning to cut a throat which turned out to be Strider's ankle.     "Good instinct there," Strider whispered, examining the ankle of his boot. "That's the sort of instinct which will help you out in the Wild."     Silently they packed their few belongings, along with several of Butterball's towels and souvenir ashtrays. Strider urged them on, emphasizing the need for haste. When they were ready, however, he stopped and led them quickly to their own rooms. The hobbits gasped as they surveyed the wreckage: the beds cut and mangled, the table actually burned to ashes, piles of crockery broken and smashed. With a motion Strider reached down and picked up one of the many pieces of paper littering the floor.     "Nazdaq," he whispered solemly. "The Riders. It is as I feared! This is but one receipt of many; they have broken in during the night and run up a massive room-service tab. We must escape from Bree before they come to us with the hotel-bill. To the stables! Quickly!"     They went to the stables as quickly as they dared, being careful not to wake the greedy Butterball, or his servants, who would undoubtedly demand a gratuity. Once inside they went directly to their ponies. But disappointment held them fast again. Around each of the ponies' necks was a slender steel cable, attached to barrels of lead painted with the legend IMPOUNDED. Strider swore.     "Fie!" Strider cursed, "It is as I feared. They have taken them in lieu of a deposit. We Rangers travel light, and seldom carry bolt-cutters. I fear we must leave them behind."     "But how will we carry all our food, and these towels?" Pipsqueak whined.     "We'll have to improvise," Strider answered. He led them out through the back door of the stable and into the early dawn light. Four good ponies! he thought. They could have fetched a good price. And what have we got in exchange? Towels! One thing Arwen's not going to be glad to see me with, it's extra towels.     The tall Ranger led the puny Hobbits through Bree by many back-ways, helping them over the occasional fence, till he reached a particularly squalid house by the edge of town. Rusting appliances and tipsy sawhorses littered the yard. Motioning the others to wait, Strider snuck up to the barn and expertly picked the lock. In a flash he was inside. After a long moment he emerged leading a large donkey. "I don't think old Ferny will miss this," Strider whispered confidentially to the others. "He stole it himself from a Southerner only four days before." They placed their possessions onto the ass and led it quietly out of Bree. At the gates it seemed positively cheerful, as if happy to get out of the small rat-infested village.     "It seems to like gates," Sam said stupidly, and then named the ass Gates for no particularly clear reason.     After an hour Strider led them off onto a narrow side-trail. "It would be good for us to get off the Road," he said. "The Riders I fear, but not half so much now as the Bree law-enforcement. I fear it will go hard for any Ranger who strays into the Pony for some time."     The way was easy all that day. Whether by Strider's skills or sheer dumb luck the trail was quiet and pleasant, and the sun was out. At Pipsqueak's request Sam fished out the bottle of suntan lotion from his pack, and they passed it from hand to hand; even the tall Man took some for his neck and the bridge of his nose. When the bottle returned to Sam it was empty. "You should have brought two bottles, Sam," Frodo said gaily. "Or perhaps three! After all, the servant class should better anticipate the needs of its masters. Anyway, you'll just have to burn, and do without."     "Oh, I'm burnin', all right," Sam muttered quietly to himself.     That night they spent under the stars. As the others fell asleep Frodo condescended and offered to let Sam suck on his fingers for a time, but Sam declined. No point, Sam thought irritably. Nobody'll be likely to wake up and witness it. No witnesses, no blackmail. Where's the point in that? He rolled the other way, pulled a stolen inn-towel over himself and fell quickly asleep.     The proceeding days turned more difficult. Strider began taking them across rougher country, leading them through rocky vales and marshlands full of carnivorous insects. The ass Gates, while content and useful on easy and well-worn paths, became sluggish and uncooperative on any path that required effort. Often it would stop with a blue scream and refuse to budge forward until someone booted it. It began to fear the sight of Strider's heavy boots. "Couldn't you have stolen something more cooperative?" Frodo asked plaintively.      "I'd rather we had bought a good pony than taken this for free, even if we had to go into debt to do it," Pipsqueak laughed.     "Do not speak of such things!" Strider said quickly, and with surprising earnestness.     They journeyed on. Mosquitos the size of small ducks began to harass them. Gates continued going slower and slower, consuming their resources at an alarming rate. After a day or so Strider found a trail fenced by high hedges and trees. "Here is an ancient path of my people," he said. "It is cunningly hidden and well-protected. It will take us East towards Gambletop, where perhaps we may figure out what the hell we're doing."     "This feels like the country we were in a week or two ago," Morrie noted. "Are there Barrow-wights around here?"     "Not here," Strider answered, and Frodo felt oddly disappointed. "Though the Exiles from Atlantis once lived here. Upon Gambletop there was once a watch-tower, set as a defence against the Leech-king of old. Many generations it stood. It is said that Isildur himself once stood upon it, waiting for Gil-Gallamine, at the time of the Last Relaxing."     "Who was Gil-Gallamine?" Pipsqueak asked. After a moment a voice began quietly singing:             I dreamed I saw Gil-Gal-la-mine,             Alive as you or me.             'I thought they killed you, Gil,' I said,             Said Gil, 'I did not flee;'             Said Gil, 'I did not flee.'             'You went to Mor-dor, Gil,' I said,             'To fight mon-o-po-ly,             And kill the Rob-ber Bar-on there,             And end the Bour-geoi-sie;             And end the Bour-geoi-sie.'             'I went there, sure, and fought His greed;             I went there, sure,' said he.             'And with me went brave I-sil-dur             And wor-kers brave and free;             And wor-kers brave and free.'     The voice fell silent. Suddenly they realized the voice had been Sam's! "Don't stop there!" Pipsqueak said. "Keep going!"     "Uh, I don't think I should," Sam answered quickly. "You might not like the rest."     "I wonder what the song means by robber baron?" Frodo asked. "And workers brave and free. Honestly, the stuff they write into these old songs. They don't make any sense. Give me a nice simple tune about ale and fox-hunting any day, that's for me!"     Pipsqueak and Morrie mumbled agreement, and proceeded with Frodo down the path. Strider gave Sam a short and knowing glance before walking away, then left him and Gates to fend for themselves.     Travel was easier on the path. By morning of two days later they say Gambletop shortly ahead of them, a great rounded hill with a broken circle of old mortarwork upon its crown. Strider urged them on more quickly, wanting to get out of the long travel exposition as soon as possible.     They made it to the foot of the hill by midday, and by sunset were nearing its summit. Just short of the top they found a small dell, fenced round on three sides by rocky outcrops; there they left Sam to set up camp, gather some wood, light a fire, prepare the meals, air out their belongings, set a watch and tend to Gates while they went on to explore a bit.     At the hill-top they found the circle of broken stone. In the middle of it was the remains of a campfire, and a handful of fist-sized stones. Strider examined the remains of the fire expertly. "Someone else was camping here," he said, "and recently. I suspect it may have been Gandalf! This fire was started by burning old Racing Forms, as is often his way."     "You mean Gandalf was here in the last few days?" Frodo snapped. "And didn't even stay to wait for us? That cantankerous old bastard still has my money, too!"     "And lo!" Strider continued, lifting up one of the larger stones. A soggy note was beneath it. Pipsqueak reached for it, only to be hit by Strider with the rock. "A note on stationery stolen from the Prancing Pony," Strider continued, picking the note up himself. "It's Gandalf, I'd put money on it. If I had any."     Frodo craned in to look. "What does it say?" he asked.     Strider held the note up and squinted at it intently. "I can't make it out at all," he answered. "His scrawling was torturous in the best of times. He wrote this in a hurry, and it's all wet and smudgy. But here is the G-rune for Gandalf," he added, pointing at a particularly messy ink-smudge.     "This word near the middle of the letter could be trap," the Ranger continued slowly. "And this word just before it might be Gambletop. And I think this little bit here in the Feenamintian runes could be... uhm... nazdaq. Yes! Yes, that's it."     With a curious sinking feeling the four of them looked past the rim of the hill and out into the falling night. On the ground far away they could just make out three dark shapes some leagues distant, who seemed to be pointing straight at them and gesticulating wildly.     "I'm sure we're perfectly safe," Strider said confidently, back at the campfire. "They were a long way away. They'd never find their way up here until tomorrow afternoon at least, and by then we'll be long gone. Nope, way too hard for them to climb this hill in the dark. Yep, absolutely safe, I'm certain of it. No need to set a watch even. Absolutely, one hundred percent safe, without a doubt, no question." Reassured by Strider's optimism, the hobbits relaxed and roasted marshmallows and told ghost-stories as the night descended.     "Tell us more about old Gil-Gallamine," Pipsqueak said to Sam.     "Can't remember," Sam said curtly and evasively.     "Old Bilbo used to sing some of that stuff," Frodo said, "though he never explained it afterwards. As I remember it, Gil-Gallamine and Isildur, and his sons Elendil and Annarggion, got together a huge army to attack Mordor. And the siege lasted for nine years, and five hundred thousand Men were brutally murdered, and five hundred thousand Elves were brutally murdered, and Gil-Gallamine was brutally murdered, and Isildur was brutally murdered, and Annarggion was bru-"     "Uh, yeah, maybe we should just skip that tale for now," Strider cut in, looking quickly towards the edge of the dell. "It's time to all go to bed and dream of sugarplums and dancing cornflakes or something."     "But we want a tale of the Ancient Days!" Pipsqueak whined obnoxiously. "Do you know any tales of the Ancient Days, Strider?"     "All too many," Strider said wearily. "For I have lived in the house of El Rond, where one may hear them all endlessly and to one's great weariness. But I will tell you the tale of Trollopiel, in brief, and only if you all shut up afterward." And once they had all agreed to his terms, the tall Ranger sat up and began singing quietly:          In Dors-o-loch, in ancient time,            The luckless wand'ring Bluto lay;          His hands were smeared with blood and grime            From battles fought in wandering.          He came to Dos-o-loch that day            Though being there was held a crime;          In desperation sought his way            Though Elves said he was trespassing.          What evil luck, what evil fate            Had come upon his mortal name!          In Dors-o-loch he might abate            The headache he had simmering.          And so beneath the fence he came,            Not knowing that he'd find a mate          In Elvenhome's most lovely dame,            A lass of sexy quivering!          One night beneath the Moon he spies            Fair Lustianne upon a hill,          A sight too good for Mortal eyes,            And no clothes there a-covering.          With inhibitions running nil,            And Bluto's heart a-tantalize,          He calls out: Fair Trollopiel!            She shrieks, and runs for costuming.          Now blind and looking for that lass            He hunts for her for twenty days,          With mem'ry of that shapely ass            That set his hormones quivering.          And all that time inside she stays,            So frightened some would think her crass          For her nocturnal naughty ways            In quiet starlight shimmering.          But hormones call, as hormones will,            And out one night she goes again          To dash through Nature, wearing nil            But dew upon her, glistening.          And Bluto sees, and calls again!            Trollopiel! Trollopiel!          Though common sense tells her to run,            She stands there, naked, listening.          Then Bluto does, lust-shaking, walk            To Lustianne with gentle care,          For if by sudden move she balk,            Another month of wandering!          But Lustianne somehow will dare            To wait for him. And so they talk,          Then touch, then grope, then passion's flare            Consumes, and leaves them foundering.          Next morning naked they were found            By guards of old King Thinowilld.          (And Lustianne, by Bluto, bound!            The sergeants stood there sniggering.)          The mighty King is fury-filled.            A Man, have Lustianne ungowned!          His daughter, looking lust-fulfilled!            His rage is now a-triggering.          But Mirilou, the Queen, recalls            To him their courtship long before,          And how he chased her through the halls            And took her 'twixt the curtaining.          How nat'ral that their child adore            That lusty joy, that now appalls          The King! If now one oath he swore,            She says, a Royal Divorcing!          So Thinowilld is stuck at last,            And says to Bluto, mortal Man,          That now his anger is all past            And this new guest he's welcoming.          But also now he plots a plan            To rid him of this horny guest          who dares to take his Lustianne!            His thoughts are dark and troubling.Strider stopped for a long moment, wrapped in some inner lust. "That is but a part of a long tale," he said, "in an ancient Elvish mode which requires rhyming three syllables on every fourth line, for which rhyming dictionaries are bloody useless. It tells of the meeting of Bluto, son of Bearhand, one of the First Men to come out of the factory, and Lustianne, by far the sexiest and most kick-ass of the Elves. Her father Thinowilld gets all huffy and makes a barroom bet with Bluto that he can't steal a slipcast from the Iron Fist of Mordred. Bluto takes him up on it, and though Thinowilld locks up all of her clothes Lustianne goes with Bluto anyway. They have many adventures. I think there's a set of children's books about it. Anyway, after a long while they settled down and raised a family. Elysium the Mariner was of their kin, and El Rond and Earohed his children. El Rond you know of. Earohed was the first King of Atlantis, and from his lineage comes the great Sea-Kings, and Isildur, and the great and unfailing line of truly just and noble kings who rightfully should hold undying Godlike dominion over every little bit of Middle-earth by divine right."     The hobbits looked at Strider. There seemed to be a fiery light in his eyes and a nobility in his face and a power-mad tremble in his lip which they had never noticed, or at any rate had been able to somehow ignore, till now.     "Wow, must be about four in the morning," Morrie said, eager to change the subject. "Look: the Moon is setting. And there's three or four dark meanacing figures beginning to make their way into the dell."     Strider leaped to his feet. "Keep close to the fire!" he shouted. "Take out those cheap little swords I gave you, and stand ready! Oh, if I hadn't been reciting that damn poem I could have been on the other side of the Hill by now."     The dark shapes came closer. In them Frodo seemed to perceive a hatred of all living things, a darkness beyond darkness, a soulless Void without light, mercy or hope. Or maybe it was just dinner catching up with him. Morrie and Pipsqueak were collapsing into a blind terror, so horrified that they could barely laugh. Sam stood off to one side, his eyes wide, barely able to concentrate on the dishes. Strider alone stood bravely, holding a flaming stick in his right hand and pointing surreptitiously towards Frodo with the left. The horrific black shapes drew nearer and nearer.     And suddenly Frodo got the urge to put on the Ring. Not with any plan in mind, not to turn invisible and certainly not to seduce them, but just to put it on. The calling seemed to come from outside him. Perhaps it was a venomous, fell voice of Doom; perhaps it was the whisper of the wraiths, carried terrifyingly by the frail wind; perhaps it was just Sam whispering "Puuut the Rinnng onnnnn..." in a deceptive whisper. Frodo could not tell. Finally succumbing to his terror, he slipped on the Ring.     The world of light faded, and Frodo suddenly saw the black shapes for what they were: nightmarish victims of other Rings, their souls forever enslaved, and not just minorities after all. One of them wore a pale crown. Yet even as he saw them they surged forward.     The Ringwraiths pressed a small envelope into Frodo's hand, then stepped back. Frodo opened it, looked briefly at the page then fell back with a cry of despair. With his last strength he refolded the letter before blackness overtook him.
  When Frodo came to he was still clutching the folded letter desperately. His companions were stumbling around, feeling for him and cursing him quitevividly.  "Frodo? Fro-o-do?"  "Frodo! Frodo! Where is that addlepate?"  "Master Frodo! Master! Oh, Frodo, me dear, me dear! This is your Samcalling for you! You still owe me two weeks' wages, dammit!"  "You should have agreed to suck his fingers," mumbled Strider.  "You're a fine one to scold!" flared Sam, whose suspicions of Strider hadbeen amply confirmed. "Don't you think I realize you helped those Ridersfind us? Did they bribe you to do so?"  "Er... yes," said Stider. "I have to get money from somewhere, and youcheapskates are not directly assisting."  "Traitor!" shouted Frodo. They all turned towards the sound of his voice.  "All right, Frodo," said Morrie coldly. "You can take off the Ring now."  Frodo obliged and said accusingly to Strider: "I trusted you to take us toRivendell!"  "And I will," said Strider unconcernedly. "But you can't blame me if Iearn a bit of money on the way. Well, you can if you want to, but I couldn'tcare less. And now that they have given you that piece of paper I think theNazdaq will leave us alone for a while."  "Yes, the paper!" shouted Pipsqueak. "What is that piece of paper you holdin your hand? Tell us what that paper is! What's on that paper? Tell us,tell us, tell us!"  Frodo gave him a tired glance. "You're an even bigger nuisance than thathalf-brother of yours, Fatty Bolger," he said.  "Well, what is it, anyway?" asked Morrie.  Frodo ground his teeth. "It's a letter from a law firm called Goatleg,Goose &amp; Gander," he answered. "They inform me that my distant relative HippoBaggins has died and left me his estate by Lake Nurnen, and his title. (Hebelonged to a southern branch of hobbits.) He was terribly rich, being aracist slave-trader in Haradrim and Easterlings, and I am now Sir FrodoBaggins of Moneybags Hall, Nurnenshire."  "Well, what's so awful about that?" demanded Morrie. "A nice estate inMordor is nothing to turn up your nose at, particularly since you can't everreturn to the Shire. The creditors Gandalf got for you would tear you topieces."  "Of course I want the estate!" shouted Frodo. "But the paper says I mustappear in the local court in Mordor within two weeks after receiving thispaper, or else forfeit my inheritance! It will go to the state, that is tosay to Sauron, instead" He turned accusingly towards Strider. "That's whythe Black Riders really tried to get hold of me! They are working forSauron. AND YOU HELPED THEM!"  "For a consideration," said Strider calmly. "And for a consideration, I'llhelp you come into your inheritance."  "But I have to get to that court within two weeks!" stormed Frodo. "Andthere is no way I can do that, unless the Eagles carry me there." Hestopped, obviously struck by an idea. Then he said to Strider: "Would theEagles do that? Could you summon them -"  "No," said Strider decisively. "The eagles will NOT carry you to Mordor.They are not some kind of talking aircabs. But if you get to Rivendellwithin two weeks, El Rond, as a local magistrate, can grant you a defermentabout appearing at that court. I'll help you get to Rivendell in time, ifyou'll just sign this little IOU." He held forth a piece of paper. Frodotook it, read it and reeled backwards with a shout.  "Fifty thousand gold coins! You want fifty thousand gold coins to help meget there in time!"  "And it's legally binding for both of us," remarked Strider, studying hisfingernails. He gave Frodo a keen glance. "I really do not see how youwill be able to make it to Rivendell without my help. Or with me workingaginst you," he added with a light, jocular laugh which chilled the blood ofthe hobbits.  "OK, you blood-sucker," groaned Frodo. He signed the paper and tossed itback to Strider. "There!"  Strider looked carefully at the document before stowing it away. "We'llmove out now," he declared. "I think we have had enough of Gambletop."  "I want to know what the Black Riders looked like!" shouted Pipsqueak. Theothers looked at him in distaste.  "Oh, very well," said Frodo. "I'll tell you anything if you will just shutup after that. They were dressed all in black... black all the way. One ofthem seemed to be dressed in nothing except black lingerie."  "Yes," said Strider. "A couple of them are into crossdressing. One of themactually likes to disguise himself as Arwen, my fiancé. And he's quite goodat it; he won a contest for Arwen imitators some years ago."  "One of them had a pale crown."  "That would be the Leech-king. He went bald thousands of years ago, and henever walks under the sun, so of course his crown is pale."  "Well, I agree about getting off this hill," said Morrie. "I don't likethe wind. I think it's going to rain."  "Or snow," said Strider. "In that case we might see the Sand-Orcs throwsnowballs at each other. Some peope come here to watch it."  "Well, I don't," said Morrie.  "My point is that a day's march from here is the Forsaken Inn, whichcaters to the tourists. If we start now we might be there in time forsupper." Strider rubbed his stomach. "I'm so hungry!" he moaned. "I haven'teaten properly since we left the Prancing Pony."The evening saw them installed at the Forsaken Inn, which was run by achuckling, cold-eyed man called Benjamin Butterball, the brother of Barlimanat the Prancing Pony. Before they arrived there, Strider had warned themabout this fact and advised them not to flaunt the towels they had stolenfrom Barliman. After having paid in advance, they sat down to a meal offried Mûmak's ear with Gondorean fries and garlic butter, though Strider'sslobbering, greedy way of wolfing down his food made the others lose theirappetite.  "If you keep eating like that you'll be known as Waddler instead," Morriesaid to him. Strider glared at him and then defiantly ordered butteredmuffins with his after-dinner coffee.  "Why didn't the Nazdaq take the Ring from Frodo?" asked Pipsqueak. Sincethis was actually a quite clever question, nobody glared at him.  "Aparently, those three didn't know that Frodo carries the Ring. They areeven more stupid than their master, thank Eru," said Strider through a hugemouthful of muffins while melted butter dribbled down his chin. The sightwas so disgusting that the others left the able and went to bed.The following morning saw Strider complaining at the breakfast table aboutthe fact that the inn did not serve Choco-Frosted Sugar Bombs. For somereason, this made the others enjoy their toast and marmalade more than theymight possibly have done otherwise. Frodo improved his mood further bysmuggling Westfarthing Chinook into his coffee; when they once more hit theroad he was decidedly tipsy.  "Sam, why don't you recite a poem for us?" he burbled as he staggered lastin line down the road.  "Very well, Master Frodo," said Sam with a faint sneer. "I hope you likethis one." He began to sing to an old tune.            Squire, the fool, he sat on his stool,            counting his gains as a plutocrat's tool;                For many a year he had gnawed the poor,                    For gold was all he cared for.                        Cared for! Dared for!            In his house on the hill he dwelt alone,                    For gold was all he cared for.            Up came Tom with his big boots on.            Said he to the squire: "Pray, what is yon?                For it looks like the coins o' my nuncle Tim,                    Who belonged to the struggling masses,                        Classes! Asses!                This many a year has Tim been gone,                    Who belonged to the struggling masses."            "My lad," said Squire, "this gold I stole.            But what be bones that lie in a hole?                Thy nuncle owed me for food and rent,                   To pay for that his coins he spent.                        I lent! He went!            He can spare a share for a poor old mole,                For his money for better folks was meant."            Said Tom: "I don't see why the likes o' thee            Without axin' leave should go makin' free                With the money belongs to my father's kin:                    So hand the mazuma over!                        Rover! Trover!                Though dead he be, it belongs to me;                    So hand the mazuma over!"            "For a couple o' pins," says Squire, and grins,            "I'll flay thee too, and gnaw thy skins.                A bit o' fresh mint will go down sweet!                    I'll try my bailiff on thee now.                        See how! Cash cow!                I'm tired of gnawing old bones and skins;                    I've a mind to plunder thee now."            But just as he thought his profit was caught,            He found his hands had hold of naught.                Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind                    And gave him the boot to larn him.                        Warn him! Darn him!                A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thought,                    Would be the way to larn him.            The class-conscious prole took back what Squire stole            and hanged him and buried him in a hole.                We'll kick the toffs from their fancy homes,                    And give them the rope to still them.                        Kill them! Fill them!                Yes, we Reds will take back what the Squires stole,                    And give them the rope to still them.  "Well, that's a warning to us all!" laughed Morrie. "That will be the day,eh, Sam, lad?"  "It will indeed, and no mistake," said Sam darkly. They walked on insilence, Frodo hiccoughing.The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was nosign of any other travellers to be seen, but suddenly they heard a soundbehind them: a strange, rattling, coughing sound. While they hesitated, adilapidated old T-Ford came in sight. As it drew nearer they saw that a hugefrog was sitting behind the wheel. The car stopped and the frog got out.  "Haista paska!" it shouted. This is a vulgar term in an Elvish dialect androughly means: "Ah, you at last!"  "Haista paska yourself," answered Morrie. "And who may you be?"  "I'm Morton the Frog," declared the driver, "and I have been sent by ElRond to help you."  "Help us?" said Strider. "He sent a frog to help us?"  "Do not underestimate the green side of the frog," said Morton. "Kiss meand find out!"  Strider was about to answer something intemperate, but checked himself.Suddenly, a strange gleam lit in his eyes. To the amazement of the others,he strode (or possibly waddled) up to the frog, grasped it in his arms andkissed it. The frog turned into Arwen, the Elven princess.  They all stared at her in silence. When Arwen had been born, she had beena very beautiful maid, but that was thousands of years ago. With everymortal life span she laid to her age, she had also added the beauty of onemortal maid. To put it another way, she was by now very good-looking indeed.  The effect on the rest of the company was stunning, but Frodo was filledwith madness. For the first time he truly realized what sex was all about.Suddenly, as in a dream, he saw once more Cassiopeia Took's benippledglories in front of him, like two enchanted bombs of desire. There was aroar of passion in his ears; it was drowned by the piercing cries of hisblood as it carried him away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, and theroaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him. He heard and saw nomore.
     "So you're going to go through with it, then," Gandalf the Wizard said slowly.     "I am," Bilbo replied. "I've been planning this for a long time. It'll give the Hobbits of the Shire something to talk about for the next nine days - or ninety-nine, more likely. Anyway, at least I'll have my little joke."     "Who will laugh, I wonder?" Gandalf mused aloud, scratching his beard idly.     For weeks carts and caravans were coming from all over Middle-earth to bring provisions for the Grand Old Party, as Bilbo referred to it. Wagons of food from the Dwarvish mines at Erebor, shiny rocks from the Sea-elves and fancy seductive packages from southern Mirkwood arrived daily, making the neighborhood generally more crowded and cluttering up avenues. Even those who hadn't said anything bad about Bilbo before were starting to show their annoyance. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is starting to get a mite annoying," old Gaffer Gamgee grumbled, standing outside the pub. "Queer goings-on, and no mistake. Why just yesterday a bunch o' pesky Wood-elves dragged their cart right acrost my yard and ruined my taters!"     "A bunch of Men from Bree came to my place yesterday and tried to sell me some aluminum siding," mused Old Noakes of Bywater. "They said it was because they had extra after building that horrible Quonset hut over the Party Tree, and they were trying to unload it. Strange folk hereabouts."     "Yes, but it's good for the economy," sneered Bill Ferny, the local banker. "A lot more money in circulation. Market's been doing well. Unionization is down because of all the entry-level service positions that are being created. Widening gap between the haves and have-nots, don't you think? Good to find work for idle hands."     "And you don't know nothin' about anythin', Ferny," Gaffer Gamgee snapped, echoing the popular community sentiment. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is a right bastard, as I've often said, and it's small wonder if trouble don't come of him and his imperialist ways. The Revolution's a'comin', and it's the likes o'you who'll be the first ag'inst the wall, so sayeth the Lord." And with that he spat a well-aimed beer-nut into Ferny's glass.     At last the day of the Big Party arrived. Everywhere there was too much to eat, and by midafternoon there were broken presents lying all over the Shire attesting to the low quality of their manufacture. Gandalf set off a series of fireworks later on in the day, including great skywriting missiles and little flaming butterflies who took to wing, sailed off into the Eastfarthing and burned all its trees to the ground.     The last firework sent up a great black smoke which took the shape of a giant mountain of fire. A flicker could be seen of a giant dragon sailing about its peak; after a moment the great dragon went sailing over the heads of the crowd, causing great panic and consternation and six outright heart attacks before imploding somewhere over the Sackville-Baggins' neighborhood, causing considerable property damage which was never properly repaired for generations afterward.     "That is the signal for supper!" Bilbo cried out to the survivors, who were only partly mollified.     Later on, in the specially-designed quonset hut which Bilbo had built especially for the occasion, all his friends and neighbors were helping themselves to their third helpings of macaroni and cheese and potato salad (the latter laced liberally with what Bilbo called the "traditional secret ingredient", which while not actually a narcotic still had unusual effects, the sum of which were still under scientific inquiry in some circles), Bilbo stood up and motioned for quiet. "A speech! A speech!" some of his neighbors cried out in fear.     My dear Hobbits! Bilbo began. There was much cheering at this, as Hobbits on the whole are a rather egocentric lot, and anyway the latest round of potato salad was beginning to kick in.     My dear Bagginses and Bracegirdles, Boffins and Borfledebees, Casmits and Cantankerums, Fassbinders and Fazoolas, Wombats and Wafflefoots. "WaffleFEET!" cried out an irate old man at the back, in fact the very man who had earned the name when Bilbo's nephew Frodo had accidentally dropped a hot waffle-iron on his feet some years ago. He had borne the Bagginses no ill-will, since the settlement was quite generous.     Wafflefoots, continued Bilbo, oblivious. This is my nine hundreth birthday! And though one million years is too short a time to have spent with you all...     There was some muffled conversation throughout the hall, which Bilbo took notice of. Well, on bad days it seems like a million years, he explained. Anyway, though ten billion years is long enough to endure from all of you, this is IT... I am GOING... I am leaving NOW... GoodBYE! And with that Bilbo leaped up, tore all his clothes off, scattering them about the astonished guests' heads, and ran from the great Hut screaming and flailing his arms.     Young Frodo looked on in bemusement, refusing to answer questions from the astonished crowd. Everyone knew, of course, that Bilbo was a big man in the community. But - and Frodo looked at the crowd, particularly noting the astonishment on old Lobelia's face - until now, nobody knew just how big.     "Well! That's done!" Bilbo laughed, emerging from the bedroom at Bag End freshly dressed. "You know, Gandalf, I've been wanting to do that for as long as I can remember. Now I think this would be an excellent time to leave the Shire, at least before they can all find their torches and axe-handles. Everything stays with Frodo, as we promised."     "Including the Ring?" Gandalf asked.     "Well, yes, I suppose so," Bilbo replied. He pulled the Ring out from under his cloak, where it hung on a fine golden chain Bilbo had stolen of old from the Brandybucks. "Still, though, I kind of hate to get rid of it."     "This seemed to me to be the only thing worthwhile about your whole stupid plan," Gandalf said uncharacteristically. "Put it on the mantel and walk away from it. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!"     "It's mine! And I shall keep it, I say!"     Gandalf raised himself up to his full height. Bilbo's hand reached quietly for the hilt of his sword. "It will be my turn to get angry soon," the wizard intoned. "Listen to me: you must give Frodo the Ring!"     Bilbo suddenly laughed. "Oh, that?" he grinned. "Well, of course I'm giving him the Ring! I thought you meant the chain." Slipping the Ring off the chain he set the circle of gold on the mantel without a second thought. Then he slipped the chain about his neck. "I love this chain. Stole it from old Matuseck Brandybuck back before he went senile. Wouldn't part with it for love nor money. No, I don't give two flies about the Ring. Nothing but trouble, that thing has been.     "Well, I'm off, Gandalf! I'm off on the road again, and not a moment too soon by the look of that crowd down there." And taking an old walking-stick from the stand by the door Bilbo went outside, taking a path around the back of the Hill so he could leave unobserved, and as he left he began singing a song quietly to himself:      While often by the door I lie      And look upon the mountains' feet      And think of rains and hikers' pains      And sleeping wetly in the sleet,      When darkness' cry does terrify      And wilderness encircles you,      And being food for goblins' brood      Is one choice, and starvation two;      Then staying home instead of roam      Will have a very great appeal!      Forego the Quest! And have a rest!      Let Dwarves and Elves and wizards squeal!      But since the Shire is filled with ire,      And all my neighbors fevers grip,      It's plain to see! I must agree!      The time has come to take a trip!     Hours later Frodo returned to Bag End, a little glad to have thrown off the pursuit at last. He started at first to discover someone waiting for him in the living-room, but sighed with relief when he saw it was only Gandalf.     "Did he get away?" Frodo asked.     "He did," Gandalf replied. "And just at the last, for they were getting ready to set after him with dogs. Luckily he doubled back at the Three-Farthing Stone, as I recommended, or there would be a special bonfire in Tuckborough tonight. Are you well?"     "Yes," Frodo replied. "I managed to convince everyone I was uninvolved with the Hay Incident."     "Good," Gandalf said. He lit his pipe with a nearby candle and looked at Frodo evenly. "He left things for you on the mantel. The deed to Bag End, a signed statement saying you were only an unwitting accomplice in the Bywater Incident, and-"     "The Ring!" Frodo said, looking at the mantel with astonishment. "Has he left me that?"     "He has," Gandalf replied, "though you'll have to find a new chain. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own - don't use it! Now or later! It may have other powers besides quick and easy seduction."     "I can't believe Bilbo left me the Ring," Frodo gasped. "He used to say that it and a bottle of Westfarthing Chinook was all you needed for the perfect weekend."     "Well, lock it up someplace and stay away from it," Gandalf intoned. "No Took-wives, no Elf-virgins, and no real estate deals. And no political aspirations! In the morning I'm off to see if I can learn more about it. In the meantime leave it unused until I return."     "I'll, uh, I'll think about that, all right," Frodo blurted, trying hard not to think about the Ring and young Cassiopiea Took.     The next morning Gandalf left, leaving Frodo with only his thoughts, his yearnings and a half-empty bottle of Westfarthing Chinook for company.
        Sam roused himself painfully, but the less said about that,the better. Unable to proceed without falling into the chasm at hisfeet, he had stood around for a while in a rêverie, into which, notunnaturally, thoughts of wogah (specifically, of Spiegel) hadintruded. His earlier indifference to Spiegel's loss had been theresult of the shock of having been kidnapped, and confusion as towhether he was a true proletarian hobbit, or the heir of Isildur -- orboth. But now that the shock and confusion were past, his earlieraffection for Spiegel renewed itself within his heart.        "Who kens what indoctrinations and postmodern tortures she is nowbein' subjected tae!" thought Sam.  "She must be freed from Sauron'sgrip. Aye, I shall rescue Spiegel, and then tak the Ring to Mt.Viagra, or me name ain't Vladimir Ilyich Lenindil!" (Vladimir Ilyichwas his name in Westron; and he liked the name Lenindil, despite hisdoubts whether he was indeed, as Sauron claimed, the heir of Isildur.)        After he was done getting roused, another thought occurred tohim: while rescuing Spiegel, he could also get hold of Frodo and makethat little rat suffer for the "armchair revolutionary" insult - bymaking the oppressor an instrument of the Revolution.        Meanwhile, Gullible had moved a little out of earshot and taken awalkie-talkie out of his bag. "Agent 007 to Fat Lord," he said."Situation excellent, preciouss.  S has the R and is determined to dothe needful with it. Please alert our contactses.  Deliverance fromNassty is at hand.  Nassty will pay for calling us a narrativeirrelevancy, ssaddam.  Over and out."  He returned to Sam, and smiledin a suitably servile manner.  "Has hobbit decided what to do yet?" hegrovelled.        "Yes," said Sam.  "I must rescue Spiegel before destroying the Ring.But I have nae idea how to do either.  It doesn't look as we'll get nofurther."        "Before we fleeds, Don Giovanni heard nasties say something aboutgoing to the Tower of Cirith Undies.  To get there, we need to get toLithlad Station and take the Subway."                Sam gazed at the abyss at his feet.  In the background, in the lovelyersatz chalet of Cirith Iodel, he heard an exquisite soprano warbling:    DOR! A land, an Orkish land!    RHî! A crown for royal dude!    MIR! A jewel I hold in hand!    FA! I'd tell you, but it's rude!    SÛL! It's Sindarin for wind!    LANG! A cutlass or a sword!    Dî! A bride with Sauron sinned!    And that brings us to Mor-DOR, DOR ...A gunshot echoed in the mountains, and the song abruptly ceased. Andhard and cruel and bitter was the parking lot that met Sam's gaze.        "This is where the suburbanites leave their cars so they can usepublic transit ssysstem," explained the Don.  "Border between Mordorand Gondor heavily congessted with traffic, yes it is.  Lots ofpeople moving to Mordor; very chic, precious, very chic.  One day allpeoples will be inside, if we don't desstroy nassty Ring."        "Doesn't look very chic, with all this asphalt," said Sam.  "I reckonMordor is lowbrow after all."        "It'ss a parking lot," said Gullible.  "Were you expectingCorinthian, preciouss?"        "Weell, cultured or not, we've got to get down there somehow,"observed Sam brilliantly.  "I suppose this is where we use me rope?"        "No, let'ss ssave that for nassty ssarcasstic hobbit," said Gullible."We'll take elevator instead."        "What elevator?" inquired Sam.          "Follow uss," replied Gullible.        Gullible led Sam back into the alpine countryside. The hobbits cameto a stop at a linden tree; Gullible pulled one of the branches off,and a hidden door opened, through which the hobbits boarded theelevator.        "We'll go down to level C, and there we'll head south to LithladStation," said Gullible, pushing a button.  "A long walk, preciouss. Many carss.  Some grim and evilses, some noble and sssad.  Many proudand fair, with crown in their ssilver hoodses.  But all stinking, allrotten, all emitting carbon monoxide.  A fell gleam isss in theirheadlightsss.  Saddam.  We musst be very careful," he added, "ordrug lordss will shoot us.  Lucky thing hobbit met Don Giovanni, acosDon knowss drug lordses and can protect sstu... sensible hobbit."        The elevator stopped, and the hobbits got out.  Now began the worstpart of Sam's journey, compared to which the scaling of Mount Viagrawas as a picnic in Woody End Park in the Shire.  Cars upon carslowered before his horror-stricken gaze.  At first he looked withinterest at the licence plates and bumper stickers: "I Brake forWinged Balrogs", "I &lt;heart&gt; Minas Epcot", "If Rings of Power wereOutlawed, Only Outlaws would have Rings of Power", "It's a TrollThing; You Wouldn't Understand", "The White Council Is Racist", alongwith more refined sentiments, such as "Maria Khallas Kicks Tebaldi'sRear End", "Empower the Periphery through the Deconstruction of PowerStructures", and "Who Would Conquer the World, Must First Get the Ringof Wogah" -- to say nothing of totally obscure items like "The Natureof Being Is Psotting to TEUNC", "Bha, I Walays Tyope My Repeats","Bother, said Pooh. Some Stupid Halfwitt Has the Ring!", and "I Moofor Dwagins".  But after a while, the cold deadening monotony ofpassing car after car after car, in an asphalt desert where horses hadno names, almost overwhelmed him.  Nor did the eerie shapes he saw outof the corner of his eye contracting various illicit-looking deals andoccasionally shooting each other do anything to increase hisconfidence.        "Gullible," he said eventually, "are we mostways there yet?"        "We makess good progress," said Gullible.  "We have finished StraightLot.  Now we come to Winding Lot."        Sam was thoughtful for a moment. "When we get tae the Subway, they'llknow at once that we're no from around here," he said. "Maybe weshould have stopped at the Mall of Gorgoroth and bought us someOrc-gear like that toff Gorbush had.  As we're in Mordor, we'd betterdress in Mordor-fashion; and anyway there isn't nae choice."        "Don Giovanni came prepared for that, ssaddam," said Gullible. "Look!"        He took a bundle out of his pack and opened it.  Sam looked indisgust at the contents, but there was nothing for it: he had to putthe things on, or go naked, and even Kinko wasn't into exhibitionism. (Wlokay, he could have gone on wearing his own clothes, but he'd lostmost of them when the party was attacked, and his current outfitneeded a rendez-vous with a washing-machine -- badly.)  There werelong slacks of some unclean polyester-fell, and a vest of expensiveleather.  Over a white cotton tunic went a tie of stout ring-mail, toolong for Sam and heavy. The Don had also brought several Orc-helmets,that in the Black Speech were called fedoras.        Having disguised themselves as best they could, they set out again. The journey through the Winding Lot was much like that through theStraight Lot, except that their route sloped gradually downwards, in asort of spiral.  Finally, when Sam thought he would scream if he sawanother Mordcedes-Lurtz, Khadillak of Harad, Shevrolugbúrz,Orcsmobile, or Ford of Isen -- to say nothing of the Nazdas,Elfbusters, Torogas, Valaraukor, Gondas, Sangahyundaes, Orcuras, NastyGreen Slimy Beasties, Ancalagons, Smaug-guzzlers, Nissis, and ThÛbarus-- they came to an end of the cars, and beheld a glass wall, and aglass door in the midmost thereof, and over the door was carven theword: Subway.  And they rejoiced at the sight and were glad.        Three eras had passed in the history of Mordor's public transitsystem.  In the Dark Years during the Second Age, Sauron and Mini hadcreated an efficient Eagle Express system. But after the loss of theRing, the Eagles got uppity and services declined, so Sauron createdan underground railway system that was the wonder of the world, withfast and clean vehicles and sumptuously elegant stations. In thelatter years of the Third Age, however, budget cuts in transportationhad changed all this -- although there is no denying that some of theolder stations retained a dishevelled dryad loveliness. But the systemwas showing its age and tending to a certain greyish monotony, despiteSauron's attempts at inexpensive beautification through paintings andsculptures by various avant-garde artists.  The trains no longer ranas frequently as they had aforetime -- especially on weekends -- forbudget cuts had impaired services.  It didn't help matters that thestations near the Western border were the abode of drug-traffickersand other nasties, for the mind of Sauron was too often elsewhere inthese latter days (elsewhere being primarily various portions ofShelob's anatomy).        The hobbits mastered their fears and entered the station, taking aglass elevator downstairs to the main lobby, where they stood in linefor twenty minutes or so at the booth behind several snooty Orcs,mischievous Trolls, and fascinatingly witty Balrogs.  While theywaited, Gullible explained their route.        "We need to take ungwë train to 42nd Ssstreet, which the Orcs callMishkoltz, preciouss," he said. "Long ride and out of our way, but noother way to make the connection, because the Northeast-boundngwalmë doesn't run on weekends; doing nassty and inconvenientconsstruction work, the Orcses are.  Ungwë train takess uss to CanalStreet, at ssouthern corner of Lithlad Station. There we get onssilmë nuquerna, which goess to 161st Street, the northern corner ofLithlad.  There we need to get on quessë and take it to CirithUndies. Very crowded at Cirith Undies; lots of outdoor operaperformances there, yess lotss.  They hurts our ears, my poor littleears."        "Ye mean there are trains runnin' inside the train station?"blurted Sam, startled.        "Yes, ssaddam," replied Gullible. "Big station.  Orcses and stuffmusst gets through somehow.  This is the only way."        "But why is the station so huge?" asked Sam.        "Acos Sauron got carried away with his building craze and didn'tknow where to sstop, the basse masster of treachery... saddam." Gullible said nothing about the corrupt building schemes in whichSauron's evil twin Saurtre had been engaged, before he finally ran offand joined the narco-terrorists for a lark; for no one learned of thatuntil Mordor's secret archives were made available to historians inafter days.        "Wow, Gullible, ye really are an expert!" cried Sam.        "Comess with the job, precciouss," said Gullible, patting himself onthe back.At this point they finally found themselves at the head of the line.         "Where ya goin'?"  asked the guy in the booth.        "Cirith Undies," said Gullible.        "6 flokarinos," said the guy.  Gullible put his head close to thewindow-pane and whispered something that Sam couldn't hear; but theguard became almost polite and handed Gullible two tokens with wingedspeed. The hobbits passed through a turnstile to the platform, whereseveral surly Orcs and other denizens of the Land of Shadow and HighCulture, mostly in uniform, stood around, waiting for the dilatoryungwë to wend its way thither.        While waiting, Sam tried to listen to the locals, but couldn't hearmuch, as no one spoke above a whisper.  He did hear bits and pieceslike "situation in Ethelien's getting worse", "even in Dor Remi", "theBig Bosses, even the Biggest, can make mistakes", "something almostslipped", "too lax", and "curse the Gondorians!"  Even theLurtzafarians seemed to be rather down.        Finally the train arrived.  There is little to tell abouttheir journey, for monotonous is the public transit in the Land ofChiaroscuro Lighting Effects. They were in a land of darkness wherethe days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered wereforgotten too.  Oft and anon the trains would stop between stations,or would suddenly start going in the exact opposite direction to thatin which they were supposed to go.        "Come on, you miserable sluggard!"  growled Sam, after thequesse train had stalled for 45 minutes. "Now for it!"  Out westwardin the world it was drawing near noon upon the seventeenth day of Marchin the Shire-reckoning, and even now Gandalf was smothering (or almost)Paragraph Took, shooting Ariellë, pretending to murder Dr Faramir,and trasking and burning Denethor and Co.; Otto was incineratingMorrie (or so everyone thought, although it turned out later that theincinerator was really a transporter); I suppose we should be gladthat Sam didn't get liquidated and replaced by some colourless slobnamed Blotto; Aragon was bringing Boromir back to life and turninghim into the splitting image of the ancient king Wupdidu and killinghim again by accident; the indestructible Steward's heir was being brought back to life by Ariellë -- who withal was alteringArwen's sexual identity (but brief was that amour) -- and then killedagain by Gandalf and then coming back to life, revealed as a truetoon; El Rond was, very likely, being poisoned by a disgruntled chef;and I would not be surprised if some nasty little computer gremlinshad somehow annihilated all the Valar (come on, can I at least killoff Tolkas? I never liked the guy), and if Eru had brought them backfrom the dead with all deliberate speed.  At one point, tachyonparticles wiped out all life, but fortunately Captain Picard saved theday by going back in time, etc., etc., etc.. Yet amid all their caresand fear and premature deaths and resurrections, the thoughts of theirfriends (and enemies) turned constantly to Frodo and Sam (andoccasionally to Gullible).  They were not forgotten. But they wereconveniently beyond aid, and no thought could bring any help toSamwise, Hamfast's son and Don Giovanni Tenorio the Gullible; theywere utterly alone.  For their purpose was to serve as fall guys, sothat Gandalf and the leaders of the West could maintain a plausibledeniability, if the mission went agley.  (Although Gandalf'sdeniability was getting less plausible with each enormity hecommitted.)        As they waited for the train to get moving again, Sam mulledover the events of the last few days.  "I'm sair confuzzled, andthat's a fact," he thought. "It's me eternally self-doubting sidea-comin' oot again." He recalled Google Junction: the billboards andone-hour motels uncounted, the gas wars, the commercialism, theremakes of Flipper and Mr. Ed, the boring conferences; heremembered the neon glitz of Shelob's nightclub. And yet, Sauron hadsubjected the hobbits to opera and other classical music stuff in anappallingly ornamental setting; and had, moreover, conveyed a certaindeconstructionishness. Was it possible that more than one culturallevel existed in the Black Land, that everything in it was not of oneboring, stereotypical, cartoon-evil piece?  To get an idea of whatMordorian culture was like, Sam looked at the ads that embellished thetrain's interior. Obviously, this question was much more importantthan the boringly practical one of how he was supposed to get to MountViagra and destroy the Ring without being killed.  But it was not easyto get an answer.  Much poetry he beheld, most of it by Gorbush, thevery same who had wogahed Spiegel from his arms. A fairly typical oneread:     gondor narconasties     wouldn't you know it?     losers!And another:     lady hobbit she's really sexy     wogah wogah did you say? yep     ~&amp;~But right next to this somewhat arcane stuff, Sam saw an advertisementfor Koorsthak Lite, and next to that, a painting of a can ofKampbelghurghak's Soup by Andy Orchol, provocatively captioned "Is ItArt?" Thereafter came a painting of giant watches by Salvad-dÛr Dalrog...Sam's eyes began to glaze over, barely taking in the ad forHustler that followed.  As he pondered the matter, Sam came to afearful realization: In the postmodern bizarrerie of the Mordoraesthetic, pop kitsch and highbrow avant-gardism went hand in hand. (Meanwhile, Gullible was engrossed in Spying for Dummies.)        Finally they escaped from the toils of Mordor's public transitsystem. They found themselves in the Cirith Undies district, an area sopostmodern that even Derrida was shocked. Strange shapes they saw,which resembled bits of molten lava that had cooled and lay liketwisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented earth. As he lookedmore closely, Sam saw that these weird shapes were actually some kindof rarefied metal sculpture.  "By Lugnardo da Vinyamar, the pomoNazdaq sculptor, ssaddam," hissed Gullible. From somewhere to theirleft came the sound of singing and orchestral music, wherein Samrecognized the vile evil of opera, which The Badguy Formerly Known AsGandalf had once called "an abomination so loathsome that the veryheavens seem to plug their ears in horror".  (That purple passage waspresumably ghost-written.)        To the right, Mount Viagra and Barad-dÛr lowered in the distance.As he gazed upon Barad-dÛr Sam groaned at the bad jokes that issued forththerefrom, and took no comfort whatsoever in the fact that they werecultured bad jokes, such as "how many sopranos does it take to screwin a light-bulb", and several very nasty jokes about tenors andviolists. He barely listened as Gullible explained the postmodern(absence-of-)significance of the enormous dinner-forks that adornedthe battlements of Barad-dÛr, and of the gum that it metonymicallychewed and popped ("that was scary, and that's a fact," as Sam laterrecalled), how they (re)"present"ed the hypertextuality of being,etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.   Multipurposed and polyvalent wasSauron's stronghold, the ironic and clever dinner forksmise-en-questioning the buttresses of knife-edged iron, walls ofimpenetrable stone, doors of heavy adamant all marked "ENTRANCE ONLY,"and interminable window offices, which in turn gave this monument tohighbrowdom the appearance of a movie set for some film noir -- animpression that could not quite dispel the drollery conveyed by theminiature busts of Orc-composers that stood over each entrance, northe erotic appeal of the posters of Shelob that adorned the doors.        Further off Sam and Gullible beheld the terrible mountain, thedread goal of their quest.  Ever and anon the furnaces far below itsuplifted head would grow hot, and with a great surging and throbbingpoured forth a river of some disgusting fluid or other from chasms inits sides, blazing towards Barad-dÛr down great channels of strangelyFreudian aspect, while purple flames soared heavenwards.        "We are not going that way yet, if hobbit insists on ssilly resscueplan," ssnorted Gullible. "We musst go left if we are to get to CirithUndies.  Unfortunately, it will not be easy.  We'll ssee, precious, ohyess, we'll ssee."        "Hobbit does insist on silly rescue plan," said Sam.  "Let's go!"        The hobbits bore to their left, where they found themselves firstin a kind of park, whose shrubbery was trimmed into shapes of shockingindecency (at least by Shire standards: "No sex please; we'rehobbits!" was the Shire's motto). Some giant roaches had organized atap-dancing party in a piazza. Here peace still reigned, if a watchfulone.  Sam and Guillible heard a soprano singing a duet with a barelyaudible alto over a chorus of bassi. Before long, they arrived at acrowded outdoor amphitheatre full of Orcs, Trolls, Rogs,jack-o'-lanterns, and other aliens, all dressed to the nines andgaping at a stage within a kind of band shell.  Sam looked, and wasfilled with horror at what he saw: Orcs lighting bonfires and toastingmarshmallows by having slaves hold them in the fire with their barehands, while a woman knelt on the floor and sang some aria ofheartbreaking beauty. A small figure in an elaborate costume wastrying to sing alto, but all that came out was an annoying squeal. The supratitles didn't help much, for the sentence In 3010, thepotatoes triumphed conveyed little meaning to Sam's mind.        Enraged at this treatment of the slaves, Sam cried out: "Iend this exploitation! Why do ye allow your oppressors tae inflict thisindignity upon ye?  Rise, for ye have nowt tae lose but your chains --and that's a fact!"        "Ssssh! Ssstupid hobbit!" hissed Gullible.        "Cannot you see that this is great art?" sniffed an Orc in theaudience nearby, whom Sam recognized as Gorbush.        "I find the interruption very apt," said a Nazdaq, sitting nextto Gorbush. "It is a metaphor for aesthetic aperture.  There is noclosure or finality to the artistic work, but it is imminent withinbeing."  Naturally, the Nazdaq sent shivers of dread and despair downSam's spine, and all that.        "I see your point, Lugnardo ..." began Gorbush, but before hecould reply, another Orc yelled at the would-be alto (who was,unfortunately, now partially audible), "Ho la!  You there, youdunghill rat! Do you call that a high B-flat?  Stop your squeaking, orI'll come and deal with you.  D'you hear?" Annoyed, Lugnardo cast aparalysis spell on the complaining Orc; thereafter, the audience wasmore or less quiet until the intermission.        During the intermission, Sam, accompanied by Gullible, corneredGorbush and asked what the Utumno was gaein' on. (Gorbush easily sawthrough their pitiful Orc-disguises in any case.)        "This is a performance of Verdishnakh's Uglucco," explainedGorbush.  "A brilliant, radical production by Lugnardo the Nazdaqsculptor.  (Not as radical as Petér Sellárz's production of DonCeleborno; Sauron nixed that and the director as well.)"  He loweredhis voice, and whispered, "Lugnardo is also charged with protectingFrodo. We have to be extra careful, since he's making his operaticdebut today, under the pseudonym Andrea Bocelli." Gullible stretchedand yawned in facetitious boredom.        "Sae that's who the wee runt was, who couldnae sing," said Sam.Gorbush nodded. "And where are he and Spiegel being kept?" continuedSam. "And are they bein' weel treated?"        "Yes, they're being well treated," replied Gorbush in a whisper,"but we cannot discuss that further now. Even here, the Fat Lord hasspies. After the performance I will take you backstage to meet yourcompanions, and we shall see. For now, I will explain the opera toyou." Gorbush proceeded to do so, at length, for the rest of theintermission.  Sam remembered very little, except that the very lovelysoprano's name was Nazwaz, Easterling for "Flashing Lotus."  Gulliblehissed and muttered under his breath: "Who careses? Wasste time,ssaddam.  Need to desstroy curssed thingy. Gandalf will not bepleassed, precciouss, no he won't.  Beer iss too expenssive, ssaddam,ssaddam..."        When the intermission ended, Sam (having nothing better to do)sat through the rest of the opera, and actually found himself liking it(except for Frodo's performance, which stank), in spite of constantlyrepeating to himself in an undertone, "Opera is evil, and that's afact; opera is evil, and that's a fact; opera is evil, and that's afact..."  Gullible plugged his ears.        As they left the performance, Sam and Gullible found Gorbushin the middle of a heated argument with another Orc.        "Then you must go deliver my critique to Lugburz," he was saying."I must go backstage anyway.  But I'm hurt.  The Black Pits take thatfilthy hidebound traditionalist Ralfpat!" Gorbush's voice trailed offinto a string of politically charged epithets.  "I gave him betterthan I got, but he flamed me, the reactionary, before I killfiled him.You must go, or I'll get you demoted. News must get through toLugburz, or we'll both be for the Black Pits.  Yes, you will too.  Youwon't escape by skulking up here."        "I'm not going down those stairs again," growled Lurtz, "be you poetlaureate or no.  Nar! Keep your hands off your mouse, or I'll put avirus in your laptop's guts.  You won't be poet laureate long whenthey hear all about these goings-on.  I've fought  for the Toweragainst those stinking UNM-rats, but a nice mess you precious criticshave made of things, fighting over the new cabinet position."        "I have nae idea what the bloody UdÛn ye lads are talkin' aboot,"interrupted Sam.  "Nor do I care.  I just want to be taken to whereFrodo and Spiegel are, an' I'm no wantin' tae bide my time aboot it."        "Sssss! Wasste time! Very sstupid, yess, very dumb, yess verymoronic!" grumbled Don Giovanni.        "My apologies," said Gorbush to Lurtz.  "Hobbits don't understandthe finer points of Orc-etiquette, like Never interrupt a debate onaesthetics."  Turning to Sam and Gullible, he said, "This is Lurtz,Frodo's trainer in the martial arts, and my assistant." Turning backto Lurtz, he said, "I have to go now.  We will speak of this morelater.  Deliver the critique, and come back to the Tower after that,or I'll make you listen to Gondorian rap."  Lurtz shuddered andleft, muttering under his breath.        "Very well; since you are so eager to see your employer, let us beoff," said Gorbush to Sam and Gullible. "Excuse me, but I will have toblindfold you."        "Gettin' used tae it, by noo," muttered Sam, as the Orc placedspecial mauve-tinted glasses over his eyes.        "If you remove the glasses, an explosive will detonate," saidGorbush, as he prepared to put another pair of glasses over Gullible'seyes.        "Ssssss! We're friendsses! You can't seriously mean to blindfold DonGiovanni!" hissed Gullible.        "You're not on the list of persons with security clearance; so yes,I do seriously mean to blindfold Don Giovanni," replied Gorbush, doingit.        "Cruel! Tricksy! False!" whinged Gullible; but under his breath hesneered, "Trusst not in ssikrit wayses; we have long spied out thisrealm, yess preciousss, hee hee!"        They went on a longish trip, taking several elevators, an escalatoror two, and the odd secret passage.  When Gorbush finally removedtheir blindfolds, they found themselves in a modern art gallery filledwith Dalrogs, Van Gorgoroghs, Myrchs, Mordnets, Pollorks, and otherhorrors. "Frodo and Spiegel are in the Pikassoblug," whisperedGorbush.  He revealed that a somewhat distorted female portrait was infact a panel in the wall leading to Frodo's and Spiegel's secretlodgings.  As they entered the hidden apartment, the realization thatFrodo was near filled Sam with revolutionary rage, and he sang in aloud voice:     In Western lands beneath the boss,     the banners rise in Spring,     the workers march, the peasants cuss,     the merry Wobblies sing.     Or maybe Rosie calls a strike     and swaying beeches bear     placards and posters, red on white     amid her branching hair.     Though here at journey's end I lie,     in pomo buried deep,     beyond all corporate towers high,     beyond all prices steep,     the workers' flag is scarlet bright     for blood our martyrs shed:     I will not sell my life for lite,     until the boss is dead.        "Oh dear, I left Spiegel's... erh... thing behind," saidGorbush in a worried voice.  "I'll be right back.  Don't move until Ireturn."  He darted out the hidden entrance. Sam and Gullible lookedaround the luxuriously appointed room in wonder, admiring itselaborate bookcases, filled with tomes with titles like MovablePeripheries: The Exiled Margin Rewrites Itself: A Study in EasterlingMÛmakisms.  As he stared uncomprehendingly at these books, Sam heardSpiegel moaning in a room nearby, and rushed in.  Sam trembled withdesire, and could not speak. Spiegel seemed slightly taken aback.        "Am I still dreaming?" she murmured.  "There was an Orc withmy... erh... thing in his hand, and it turns into Sam!  Then I wasn'tdreaming when I heard you singing just now, and tried to cover myears?  Was that you?"        "It was indeed, Spiegel," sighed Sam. "I'd given up hope, almost.I couldn't find you. But I have now, Spiegel, dear Spiegel."  He layback in Spiegel's gentle arms, like a child at rest when night fearsare chased away by some loved voice or hand.  Spiegel held him a bitawkwardly, as far away from her body as possible.        "Something hit me, didn't it?" mused Spiegel.  "And I fell intodarkness and erotic dreams, and woke and found that waking was evenmore erotic.  Orcs were all around me. Or rather, one was, but he washot enough for a thousand."  The enticing vision had seemed so real toher, half bemused as she still was with her desire for Gorbush.  Samhad changed before her very eyes into an Orc again, leering and pawingat her, a passionate creature with groping hands and a slobberingmouth.  But now the vision had passed. The creature was still leeringand pawing and groping and slobbering, but it was only a grubby littlehobbit.        And as Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on him buthanging on a chain from his neck, he felt enlarged, as if he wererobed in a huge distorted shadow of himself.  He felt that he had fromnow on only two choices: to forbear the Ring, though it might tormenthim, and challenge the Power that sat in its dark hold beyond thevalley of shadows; or to claim it, and seduce Spiegel.  Already theRing tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason.  Wild fantasiesarose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, striding with aflaming sword across Spiegel's fruited plain.  Then Pinko gained theascendancy over Kinko, and he saw himself once again as VladimirIlyich Lenindil, Hero of the Proletariat, and armies of workers andpeasants flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of theSauronite dictatorship. And then all the clouds rolled away, and athis command the Barad-dÛr Opera House etc. became a Kremlin andbrought forth Politburos.  He had only to destroy the Ring -- or so hethought -- and all this could be.   And after he became commissar,he'd have plenty of women to wogah -- a harem swollen to a realm; hisown hands to use, not the hands of others to command.        At this point, to Spiegel's relief, the door opened and Frodoentered. To say that he and Sam had a merry meeting would be stretchingit, but at least they didn't try to beat each other up.        "Your operatic debut was interestin'," deadpanned Sam. Frodo seemedpreoccupied, and merely grunted in reply.        "Ssstupid hobbitses waste time, messs up quesst," muttered Gulliblefor the twentieth time; but no one paid even the slightest attentionto him.        Frodo was accompanied by Jîvz, his Balrog valet, and Deeanna Troll,his counsellor. This last smiled at Sam and Gullible and said, "You'rehiding something!" before sashaying out of the the room in aprovocative gait.        "Bah, she was no very relevant to the plot, nohow," said Sam, aftershe had left.        "Please don't be so meta," said Spiegel.  "I can't stand it. Let'sstay in character, shall we?"        Frodo, meanwhile, was muttering to himself,  "The economy of beingis simply the unbecoming of unbeing ... rather like Elbereth'sperfume, that wafts into allergenicity. .. Why is this stuff sohard and BORING?  Why won't Sauron just give me the estate?"        "Ha!" said Sam.  "So the estate was a fake all along! Now we kenSauron's evil."        "I don't know if he's good or evil," replied Frodo.  "But he sureis strict.  I might even say: a fierce will, unknowing of mercy. He makesme get up every day at 5:30 a.m., read theory, swim, then afterbreakfast I have to take a quiz, talk with Sauron ... Then he lets mehave one hour of recreation, but after that I have to study the BlackSpeech for two hours; after lunch -- which consists mostly of tofu --I practice fencing with Lurtz, then religious instruction withCounsellor Deeanna Troll, then complete rest in the dark, then voicelessons with Gorbush, then I have to read more theory (GermaíneGrír, bgheeeahkhgh!!). After dinner, I take another quiz, religiousservice, talk to Sauron, bed ... Whenever I ask about my estate, hesays I'm not worthy yet.  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!  Ifeared that it was so."        "By the way," asked Sam, hastily changing the subject, "how did yeknow the way to Mordor earlier? Ye'd never been there before."        "Oh, Sauron gave Frodo and me homing devices while you were in thebathroom," replied Spiegel. "On coming to the asphalt parking lot, wealmost wondered if Sauron were indeed evil ...  Sauron laughed when Itold him that. He's sexeeeeeee! And ever since he took away that nastyphial, Frodo has been almost bearable, though he still has relapseswhen one wants to strangle him."        [Here the MS. contains an interpolation in a suspiciously roggy hand:"Sauron is as pure as the driven snow.  Since I'm the narrator, thismust be true.  And Sauron's Diary is canonical.  And I am taking overthe e-text, mwahahahhahahahhahahaha!!!"]        "I believe it is time for you to read Textual Sex and Sexual Tests,sih," interposed Jîvz unctuously.        "Shut up, Jîvz," said Frodo.  "This is a greater matter than youknow."        "Please it your Highness to remember ..." murmured Jîvz        "It pleases my Highness principally to be obeyed, old mutterer. Nowgo!"  Jîvz bowed and left the room.        Sam scowled on observing Frodo's only too familiar treatment of hisservants.  Nevertheless, mindful that he still needed Frodo's help(whether freely given or forced), Sam restrained himself from killingthe git, and instead asked, "Would ye like tae aid us on a leetlequest?  A mere trifle, we just need tae destroy the Ring and free theWestern Lands from evil.  You'll still get your estate, I'm sure. Indeed, I'll warrant ye'll hae a better time governing it as your ownmaister than as a subject of Sauron.  But first, we need tae get ridof the Ring, and that's a fact."        "You've got it?" gasped Frodo.  "You've got it here?  Give it to me!"he cried out, standing up, holding out a trembling four-fingered andgloved hand.  "Give it me at once!  You can't have it!"  He panted,staring at Sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity.        "Nay, ye avaricious bastard -- I mean, auspicious mastard. We mustdestroy yon evil engine of sorcery."        "You won't give it back, you say? Curse you, Sam, you little maggot!If you think I'm so damaged from my operatic debut and postmodernreading load that it's safe to flout me, you're mistaken.  Come here,and I'll sing falsetto in your ear.  And when some new lads come, I'lldeal with you: I'll send you to Bergzum-ishi's Wozzeck."        "I'll no give it back, not before you're dead anyway," answered Samsurlily.  "I've told you twice that we need to destroy it."        "So that's it, is it?" yelled Frodo.  "You'll do this, and you'llnot do that?  And after stealing the Ring, you'll bolt and leave me. No, you won't!  I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly first."        "Frodo, you're not helping," interrupted Spiegel.  "Why don't youleave this to me?"  She gave Frodo one of her persuasive looks, and henodded.        "I'll give you fifteen minutes to change the little Bolshevik'smind," he said.  "Meanwhile, I'll try to read some of this textual sexstuff, though reading it has practically cured me of any sexual desireI might have once had: I can't even fantasize about fishes anymore,without being reminded of incredibly boring highbrow lit crit." Withthat he stomped off.        Sam and Spiegel looked at each other in silence for a few minutes,remembering the happy and golden days of Book IV, when they had rompedin Disgiliath in innocent joy, laughing through their tears (mostly atFrodo).  Then, as Sam's thought returned to the mission at hand, Sam'sface darkened.        "So," he said, "are ye with me or against me?"        "My destiny is here," said Spiegel. "I must stay in Mordor andraise the consciousness of its people.  They need it so much, for an evilcorruption is seeping its way into the realm from the northwest."  Shesighed. "Please don't destroy the Ring, Sam," she implored. "Can't yousee that we were wrong about Mordor?  That Orcs are not all evil?"        "Nay, we must annihilate it," said Sam.  "If we don't, the Sauroniteswill take over, and their tyranny will be far worse than that of thecurrent Imperialist and Global Capitalist hegemonists."        "Sauron has brought peace to many realms," said Spiegel. "Toreadorand Cuspidor rejoice together; the topless beaches of the Southronkingdom of Rîô are in harmony with the gaming establishments of MinasVegas ..."        "His aggression shall not stand!" cried Sam.        "Why are you so sure that destroying the Ring is the right thing todo?" rejoined Spiegel.  "Because Gandalf says so?  Doesn't sound likethe Sam I know, believing something just on the authority of some fatmountebank in a pointed hat. And Gandalf is evil.  I haveexperienced the subtle -- or not so subtle -- psychological torture hedispenses in the name of advice.  And if Gandalf is so good, how doexplain the Barbie and Ken incident?   I suppose since Barbie was anEasterling and Ken an Orc, Gandalf was perfectly in the right when heturned them into plastic dolls and merchandised them."        "Tae crooked eyes truth may wear a wry face," intoned Sam.        "Indeed your eyes are almost blind," said Spiegel.  "Blinded withhatred for your Master.  You cannot see beyond your personal and classhatred.  If you did, you would realize that destroying entire races ofpeople through the annihilation of the Ring is wrong."        "Entire races?" echoed Sam.  "Aye, I forgot ye're an Orc-lover."        "Ah, so that's what's changed you," said Spiegel.  "Jealousy illbecomes you.  There is more at stake here than our personal feelings.What will happen if the West conquers?  The Orcs will be wiped out. Ordoes your belief in equality not extend to Orcs?  Because mine does!Ah, Sam, in the name of our friendship, please try to understand ..." Sam began to say something, then stopped, gazing upon Spiegel's faceintently.  His expression lost some of its harshness, and a furtivetear trickled down his cheek.        "Don't lissten to her!" screamed Gullible.  "Hobbit-witch lies,yess she doess.  She cheats us with Orcses, betrays us to them, preciouss. We musst desstroy the Ring! We musst!  Gandalf says so, and he's thegoodguy!  Sauron's the villain! SSSADDAM!!!!"        Sam continued to waver.  But at just that moment Frodo returned,still holding his Textual Sex book.  "I happened to hear the lastpart of your conversation," he remarked.  "It seems to me that evenSam ought to be able to understand that the metaphysics underlyingSauron's social democratic centralized decentralizm is nothing lessthan the modalization of being through the trajectory of its owneros."        "Bourgeois radical chic flummery!" retorted Sam, in whom hatredfor Frodo now stifled all other feelings, even his affection for Spiegeland his revolutionary ideals.  "I have made up me mind.  The Ring mustbe annihilated, to avenge your tyranny, ye effete decadent armchairfascist!".        "I end all this!" cried Frodo, suddenly seizing the Ring.        "No, no!" yelled Gullible, snatching the Ring back from Frodo'swhite-gloved, oddly cartoonish hands.  "No you won't, you thief!"        But at that moment, Deeanna Troll rushed into the room with cinematicabruptness and seized Frodo, covering the hobbit's mouth; but Spiegelwas still free and cried out, "Treachery!"        In ran Jîvz from the sauna room. "I cannot allow this to continue,"he said, brandishing his elegant Second-Age whip.        But Gullible was ready.  "Thiss iss sset to kill, ssaddam," hehissed.        "Bah, you can't kill ..." began Jîvz, before his sentence was cutshort by Gullible's devastating aim.        "Maybe not, but at leasst we can ssstuns you," sneered Gullible, asthe Balrog valet collapsed.        "GUARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" screamed Frodo as he struggled to freehimself from Deeanna's grip, but in vain.        "They've gone fishing, sih," Jîvz reminded him, as the Balrogregained consciousness..        "At my orders," said Deanna Troll.  "This country wants setting torights, and Gandalf is the one to do it.  Enough of this week-kneedhigh culture crap.  With that ring destroyed, we can make this an evilempire to be proud of... You see," she said with a sneer, "I'vebeen hiding something."        Meanwhile Sam and Gullible hastened to the door, exited throughthe Pikassoblug painting, and fled through the art gallery.  Even as heran, Sam wept.  Curiously, all the museum guards seemed to believetheir explanation that they were performance artists, even though theperformance had the unusual title, "Fat Lord's Orders."  Away into thenight they sped.  From the bowels of the outdoor opera theatre issueda high and dreadful wail.  Far up above in the darkness it wasanswered.  Out of the sky there came dropping like a bolt a wingedshape, rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek.  A jet-propelledBalrog it was, bearing a Nazdaq on what Sam supposed to be some vilemission of evil, possibly involving ballet.        "They've taken everything, Spiegel," said Frodo.  "EverythingI had.  Do you understand?  Everything!"  He cowered on the flooragain with bowed head, as his own words brought home to him thefullness of the disaster, and despair overwhelmed him.  "The questhas failed, Spiegel.  Even though he's an idiot and his magic tricksare transparent, we can't escape Gandalf's dominion.  Only 'Rogs canescape.  Away, away, out of Middle-earth, with winged speed, far awayover the Sea.  If even that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out."        "I still have hope," said Spiegel.  "I will not give up yet."        "Now I'll never get my estate!" whined Frodo. "I feared thatit was so."        "Is that all you can think about?" said Spiegel indignantly. "There's much more at stake than that! Entire races of people couldbecome extinct!  Come! We must inform Sauron at once."        "Yes," admitted Frodo. "We must tell Sauron what that slimylittle footpad and his 'Revolutionary' lackey have done."        So it was that when Gorbush finally returned, he found Samand Gullibe gone, and Frodo and Spiegel in the videoconference room.Lugnardo and Jîvz were also there, hanging their heads with shame;but Deeanna Troll was gone. Sauron was on the screen, and he did notlook happy. He sighed and murmured, "I was a fool! A fool! Ah!"
   Sam had just wits enough left to seize the phaser from Gullible andthrust it back into his breast.  "Run, Gullible!" he cried.  "No, notthat way!  There's a sheer drop over the wall. Follow me!"  Down theroad from the gate they fled.  In fifty paces, with a swift bend rounda jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of the line of firefrom the Tower.  They had escaped the hue and cry of the Balrogservants for the moment.  Cowering back against the rock they drewbreath, and then they clutched at their hearts.  "Chin oop, SamwiseGamgee!  Ye hae come tae fer tae be broot doon bae a wee bit o' hairtatteck noo..." muttered Sam.  Perching now on the wall beside theruined gate a Nazdaq sent out an alluring yet morbid aria.  All thecliffs echoed.  In terror they stumbled on.  Soon the road bentsharply eastward again and exposed them for a dreadful moment to asearch beam from the Tower.   A scintillating red point appeared on the back of Sam's head scantmilliseconds before Gullible staggered into him and they both tumbledto the ground.  A puff of dust several meters beyond heralded theimpact of thousands of steel flechettes hurled from a rifle mountedat the top of one of the battlements.  As they flitted across thekilling field they glanced back and saw a great chrome-steel shapeupon it, manlike in shape yet taller; then they plunged down betweenhigh rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join theMorgul-road.  They came to the way-meeting.  There was still no signof orcs, nor of an answer to the song of the Nazdaq; but they knewthat the silence would not last long, in Mordor's places of highculture.  At any moment now the coherent photonic beam bombardmentwould begin.   "This will nae do, Gullible," said Sam.  "If we were real orcs, weshould be walking aroond in sweats, with backpacks on oor shouldersand books under oor arms, not roonin' away as if being sniped at wi'laser-sighted ordinance.  The first enemy we meet'll ken we are naeorcs.  We must get oof this road somehoo."   "But we can't," said Gullible, "not without wingses, precious!"Sam shuddered at the thought of Sauron's jet-propelled Balrogsstreaming forth from the tower and its six outbuildings.Even as he mused in dread, a tall Man appeared not twenty pacesdistant.  Sam and Gullible started and faced him in wonder, as theyhardly ever missed the onset of one of the Big Folk, howeverstealthy.  The man was dressed in very worn traveling leathers andwore a distinctive-looking sword and a silvery guitar.  For a momentSam feared that Maglor was back to cause more trouble, but then hesaw that the man had no ears.  He must have grimaced in pity, forthe man chuckled and said, "Don't worry, they'll grow back.  I'velost my eyes before, so I know.  Now let's get out of sight.  Followme."   As Sam and Gullible trailed the man warily, the sky above beganto turn overcast rapidly.  Shortly the sun peeked out from behind acloud... then another sun, then another.  Sam whirled in amaze andsaw that the Tower had vanished and all of Sauron's buildings alongwith it.  "Who be ye, and where be ye takin' us?" he demanded.   "Good questions, though the full answer would take longer than weare alloted, Master Samwise, or should I say Lenindil?  That isn'treally your name, you know."   "How come ye tae noo my name, or, er, what isn't my name...?"sputtered Sam.   "I know many things about you, for you have followed me into battle,and fought for me, and against me, and died for me, and by my hand.I will answer your first question and perhaps the rest will becomeclearer.  I go by many names, few of them yet known in Muddle-earth,but someday at least a few of you shall have heard of Corbin ofEmber."   "Corbin of Ember?  Well, who th--" began Sam, but Corbin hadalready begun to walk into the east.  Sam and Gullible had to hurryto catch up.   As they walked, Corbin listened carefully to Sam's tale of the quest as it had transpired from his point of view, pausing it brieflyto ask questions and comment.  When they all stopped to rest and takewhat few morsels of food Corbin could spare them, Sam managed to foolGullible into dropping the Ring by shouting that it was on fire - which,as he expected, worked flawlessly.  Soon they moved on, with Corbindeftly leading the pair across a landscape that changed rapidly.   Meanwhile, at Sauron's tower, chaos had erupted, not for the firsttime this morning.  Frodo was taking a coffee break - a much-neededone, he muttered fitfully to himself - when a sudden commotion causedhim to dash to the stair to see what was going on.  Suddenly he sightedthree reavers, dressed in furs and outrageous-looking armor, bashingJîvz and the many other orcish servants with the flats of their swords.Frodo realized suddently that they had come for him!  As ran for hislife, the leader seized Gorbush's head in one great hand and bashedit against Lugnardo's.  A hollow crack! rang out as Spiegel, wailingin alarm and rage, leaped forward and was caught deftly by the secondreaver.  The third made a quick grab and Frodo, too, was trapped.Both Spiegel and Frodo now wrigged in undignified and highly agitatedpostures atop the shoulders of two tall warriors, while the middle oneinspected the unconscious butlers and poets.   "We had best make haste," he averred, looking at the inordinatelylarge and ominously empty pots of espresso strewn everywhere.  "Thereis evil here that does not sleep!"   The sky, having cycled through shades of graphite and snow as well asruby, strawberry, tangerine, lime, sage, blueberry, indigo, and grapehues, was now dim and unremarkably empty, a single westering yellowsun hidden from view.   "And here we shall part ways.  Here comes my associate with your'master' and that strange hobbit woman, Spiegel."   A hulk of a Man was herding a bedraggled and miserable-looking Frodoand an even more miserable-looking Spiegel along.  His clothingwas scant and he wore fur-lined boots and bore a gigantic two-handedsword.   "What ho, Cimmerian?" cried Corbin.  "What is best in life?"   "Crush da enemy, see dem driven before me, and listen to dalamentations of dere women!" grinned the barbarian.   "How--?  HOW did he get that - TRAITOR - out of Sauron's grip?"shouted a flabbergasted Sam.   "Let us ask him," suggested Corbin amiably.  "How did you rescuethem, my friend?"   "I had some... help," the huge man replied, his grin widening.   Suddenly, and with only a whisper of sound, a huge bronze dragonmaterialized between the parties.  Astride it sat a proud warrior,only vaguely human-looking, with a silver hand.  Behind him wasseated an albino personage of regal bearing and unreadablecountenance.  His eyes held a chilling intelligence as he regardedSam and Gullible wryly.  Strapped to the man's waist was a verylarge black runesword that reminded Sam of Dagnabit, the incrediblytalkative blade of Turin that had driven him, ironically, to fallupon it in order to smother its incessant babbling.  The bronzedragon belched flames unhurriedly and spat out a brownish,sweet-smelling substance on the ground.   "Very good!" exclaimed Corbin enthusiastically.  "That's betterthan I thought.  Did you complete the extraction without any hassles?"   "A little collateral damage," admitted the barbarian, nodding atthe first prince, who shifted his position to reveal a bound andgagged Gorbush, and Spiegel, whose thin ankles were bound withorcish rope.  The latter sniveled and burst into fresh tears."Thug, C'rum, we hates it forever, enron, enron!" she hissed,distraught.   Corbin spoke decisively.  "That's enough, Konan.  Why don't youuntie them now?"  The barbarian complied silently as Corbin mused,"How would the two of you like to come with me to a place wherethere are many orcs, well-treated and free from the domination ofsuch a one as yon Sauron?"  Gorbush continued to snore obliviously.   At this Spiegel perked up.  She mustered her dignity and looked atCorbin levelly, no mean feat considering their difference in height.   "Come.  We are needed.  There is much that you can do."   Corbin bent low to Sam, Gullible, and Frodo, whom the Cimmerianwar chief had shoved into the reunited group.  "Remember - trust noone.  The truth is... out there.  And the next time you meet a strange girl who escaped from some lab, don't be so surprised if shecan beat the crap out of you."  Corbin winked conspiratorially andstood.  "It's time to go," he called to the royal dragon-riders and thebarbarian, who followed a newly resolute-looking Spiegel as she strodealongside the bronze.  "To Britannica first, and thence... to Draino!"cried Corbin.  Together the party of six strode into the distance andvanished.   Scant seconds had passed when another man with no ears, dressed insilver and black, carrying a silver harp and an eerily similar blade,staggered into view.  His hair was dark but seemed unnaturally reddishat the roots.  Sam, Gullible, and Frodo pointed in unison.  "Nextshade over!"   Sam quickly took charge of the reunited group, over the expectedgrumblings of Frodo and the unexpected consternation of Gullible,who now seemed sullen and withdrawn.  Sam rallied both to march on.At length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against aboulder.  All were sweating.  Frodo tried to eat a few handfuls ofthe artificial snow and realized that it had no effect on histhirst.  "If Sauron himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'dshake his hand," he gasped.   "Don't say such things, ye traitor, or I'll cut ye throot!" snarledSam.  Then he stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spokeno more for a while.  At last with a struggle he got up again.  Ashe expected, Frodo was fast asleep.  "Wake up, pig!" he said.  "Comeon, ye soft slob!  You've hardly walked in days."   Sam kicked Frodo in the ribs and elbowed Gullible for good measure,though the latter was wide awake.  "MOVE out, lazy asses, or I'llkick ye all the way to the Mountain, and that's a fact!  DOUBLETIME!"  He now led the way, northward as near as he could guess,among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of thegreat ravine.   Frodo continued to whine until Sam relented and handed over hiscloak, which Frodo swapped with his heavier orc jacket.  "That'sbetter!" sighed Frodo.  "I feel much cooler.  I can go on now.But this campus is really depressing.  As I read theory in Sauron'slibrary, Sam, I tried to remember the Brandywine Bar, Woody's End,and The Water - any of the fine pubs in Hobbiton.  But I can't seethem now."   "Will you stop talking of water!" cried Sam.   "If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to her: 'Youimperialist oppressor, all we want is light and water: just cleanwater and plain flashlights, not this bottled phosphorescent oozethat's probably irradiating us all.'"  He hauled the Phial, nowglowing with its own faint green light, out of its lead-lined bagand shook it at a cringing Gullible and Frodo.  "But it's a longway to Lorien and that crazy--" Sam sighed and gesticulatedwildly towards the heights of the Ethel Duwap, now only to beguessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.   As Frodo, Sam, and Gullible stood and gazed, the rim of lightspread all along the line of the Ethel Duwap, and then they saw twoshapes, moving at a great speed out of the West, at first only apair of specks against the glimmering strip above the mountain-tops,but growing, until they plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy andpassed high above them.  As they zipped along, bobbing in thebreeze, the disembodied voice of a Nazdaq sent out a song in along, reverberating baritone; but this tune no longer held anyterror for them: it was the song of the washed-up, ill tidingsfor the Dark Tower.  The Leech-king had met Ms. Eowynifred ofEdoras City, Edoras, and her significant ohtar.   Sam's quick spirits sank again almost at once.  Even nestled inhis pocket, the burden of the Ring felt like an awful weight strappedto his waist - like the millstone of Sandyman's oppression!  Helooked at Frodo suspiciously, wondering if he realized the effecthis words were having.  Making a quick decision, he hauled Frodoaside, out of Gullible's view, surreptitiously slipping the ringfrom its chain and holding it at the base of his thumb.  "You lookpale, Frodo," he observed with mock concern.  "I've got onething I wanted: a phaser.  Enough to help us, though I guess it'sdangerous too.  Try a bit further, and then have a rest.  But takea morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves' food; it may hearten you."Pulling a twinkie from his pack and unfolding the forlorn leaffrom it, he jammed his thumb into it quickly, then divided it intothree pieces and handed one each to Gullible and Frodo.  Swallowingthe sweet, spongy cake as best they could with their parchedmouths, they plodded on as Sam strode with a smug grin that neitherof the others noticed.   The light grew no stronger, for Mount Viagra was still belchingforth a tremendous blue fume that, beaten upwards by the opposingairs, mounted higher and higher, until it reached a region abovethe wind and spread in an immeasurable roof, whose central pillarrose out of the shadows beyond their view.  They had trudged formore than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to ahalt.  Unbelievable, but unmistakable.  Water trickling.  Out ofa little gully, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the groundhad been generated by some low-grade terraforming software, watercame dripping down: the last remains, maybe, of some sweet raingathered from far distant seas, but ill-fated to fall at last uponthe walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless through the UNMcampus.  Here it came out of the rock in a little silver creek,and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly tobe lost among the dead stones.   Sam sprang towards the banks eagerly.  "If ever I see the Ladyagain, I will tell her!" he cried.  "THIS is potable water, notthat two-in-one watch dial paint she gave us!"  Then he stopped."You drink first, Frodo," he said.   "All right, but there's room enough for two."   "I didn't mean that," said Sam.  "I mean: if it's poisonous, orsomething that will show its badness quick, well, Master Bilbowas always going on about noblesse oblige, if you understand me."   "I do, you worthless scum.  But I think we'll trust our lucktogether, Sam; or our blessing.  Still, be careful now, if it'svery cold!"  Frodo's tongue was still numb from the touch of themagical sparkling snow.   The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste,like that of carbonated water laced with caffeine and brominatedvegetable oil, or so they would have said at home.  Here it seemedbeyond all praise, or indeed any aversion to caffeine overdose. They drank their fill, and Sam replenished his water-bottle.  Afterthat Frodo felt easier, and they went on for several blocks, untilthe broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall alongits edge warned them that they were drawing near to another campusbuilding.   "This is where we turn aside, Gullible," muttered Sam distractedly."Now, according to the folding map that came with the Deed, we mustturn east."  He sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across thevalley.  "I have just about enough strength left to get up to theCollege of Law there.  And then I've got to get some sleep."   The river-bed was now some way below the path. "You go to sleepfirst, Frodo," he said.  "It's getting dark again.  I reckon thisday is nearly over."  Frodo was, of course, asleep before the wordswere fully spoken.  Sam struggled with his own weariness, expectingFrodo to attack him for the Ring, but not daring to reveal hissubterfuge; and there he sat silent till deep night fell.  Then atlast, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place andlooked out.  The land seemed full of legal briefs being shuffledand books being unshelved and sly noises, but there was no othersound.   They woke together, hand in hand in hand.  All withdrew their handsin shock and looked at each other warily.  Sam was almost fresh, readyfor another day; but Frodo sighed.  His sleep had been uneasy, filledwith dreams of being impaled upon a Tree of Pain by an aristocratic-looking fellow whom everyone called "Count", and waking brought him nocomfort. Still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: hewas stronger, more able to stagger along through the huge campus.Strangely enough there was no mass transit here, though LithladStation had been a hotbed of activity.  They did not know the time,nor how long they had slept; but after a little wandering and searchthey found a covered walkway that took them partway across the UpperQuad.   Against his earlier expectation, Sam now hoped that Frodo mightsurvive until they could get back to Hobbiton - who there would believethat Frodo had willingly signed over Bag End to him?   "Since you've got the map," he asked casually, "have you any notionhow far there is still to go?"   "Uh, see, it's like this," Frodo answered.  "You know how Sauronkept sending me to those World Cultures and Geopolitics lectures?"   "Yes, and--?"   "Well, they kept impressing upon us how the political boundariesof Mordor, internal and external, were changing all the time,and the geography was in upheaval, too, what with it straddlingthe thrust fault zone that Mount V--"   "You threw away the map, DIDN'T YOU!  AAAAAARGH!"  In a fit ofrage Sam tackled to Frodo the ground and raised his fist to pummelthe hapless hobbit to a bloody pulp.  Before his hand descended,however, it occurred to Sam that killing Frodo would not helphim recover any information.  Instead he yanked the Phial ofGaladriel out of Frodo's jacket again and pressed it to Frodo'sforehead.  A cold sweat beaded across it instantly as Frodo squirmedto get away from the highly radioactive solution of radium andphosphorus isotopes.  Within moments he stopped writhing and beggingand became lucid.   "All right, here's what I remember from El Rond's maps inRivendell - bear in mind, this was made when Sauron was still inDon Guldur and so it's subject to change, and the elevation is stillnot as accurate as lat-long, but it's better than the propagandisticmaps on the Deed and the jammed GPS surveys that Jîvz showed me.I remember clearest that there was a place in the north where thewestern range and the northern range send out spurs that nearlymeet.  That must be over sixty miles from the bridge back by theTower.  It might be a good point at which to cross.  But ofcourse, if we get there, we shall be further than we were fromthe Mountain, about the same distance as from the bridge I shouldthink.  I guess that we have gone about thirty miles north fromthe bridge now, twenty-five to the outskirts of campus and eightyor so blocks cross-town through campus itself and over the highstreet before the tents.  Even if all goes well, we could hardlyreach the Mountain in a week.  I am afraid, Sam, that the burdenwill get very heavy, and you shall go still slower as we getnearer."   "You let me worry about that," answered Sam, withdrawing thePhial and carefully replacing it in the lead-lined pouch.  He'd haveto remember the Phial as a way of making people talk; perhaps theLady had done him a favor after all.  "Well, to say nothing ofwater, we've got to eat less, or else move a bit quicker, at anyrate while we're still in this valley.  One more bite and all thefood's ended, save the Elves' breakfast cakes."   "Come on then! Let's start another march!" said Sam for whatseemed the hundreth time.   "I'll try and be a bit quicker, Master," said Frodo, stillsupine, drawing a deep breath and shuddering in relief.   The trek continued interminably.  Still far away, forty miles atleast, they saw Mount Viagra, its feet founded in ashen ruin, itshuge cone rising to an artificially-maintained height, where itscaldera was swathed in cloud.  Its fires were now dimmed, and itstood in smouldering slumber, as threatening and dangerous as ahobbit's appetite between lunch and tea.  Behind it there hung avast shadow, ominous as a thesis defense, the veils of Barad-dur.The Dark Power had returned to this stronghold and was now deep inthought, and the Eye turned inward, pondering a high-resolutionvideoteleconferencing system: a bright sword, and a still-overweightbut now dignified face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great campus, gate on gate, and buildingon building, was wrapped in a brooding gloom.   It was not yet quite dark again.  They plodded along, on into thenight.  The hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few briefhalts as Frodo complained of a burning sensation on his temples.Sam looked at the "burns" and concluded that Frodo's hypochondria wasgetting the best of him.  At the first hint of grey light under theskirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in a darkhollow under an overhanging stone.   He gave Frodo water and an additional twinkie, and he made apillow of his jacket to squelch Frodo's incessant claims ofa splitting headache.  Sam did not bother to tell Frodo that hehad drunk the last drop of their water, and eaten Sam's share ofthe food as well as his own.  He expected as much gratitude fromhis former master as he did from Gandalf. When Frodo was asleep Sambent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face.With surprise he noted that Frodo's thick hair had begun to fallout in clumps, and that even the light fuzz on the backs of his feetwas thinning.   "Well, if he croaked, it would serve him right!"Sam muttered to himself.  "But I'll not have it on my head.  Waterwe must have, or he'll die of thirst before anything else does himin."   Sam, Frodo, and Gullible gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder onthis hateful land.  Between them and the smoking mountain, and aboutit north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned andchoked.  They wondered how the Lord of this realm maintained and fedhis research and teaching assistants.  Yet students he had.  As faras their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the Morgai and awaysouthward, there were camps of brightly-colored tents, some orderedlike small towns.  One of the largest of these was right below them.Barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest ofinsects, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drabbuildings.  At the western margin, a roundish green one made fromElvish-looking canvas read PUHJAFOONI/TELEFON.  About it the groundwas busy with folk going to and fro with a strange spring in theirsteps; a wide road ran from it south-west to join theMorgul-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes werehurrying.   "I don't like the look of things at all," said Sam.  "Prettyhopeless, I call it, saving that where there's such a lot of folkthere must be wells or water, not to mention food.  And these areMen, not Orcs, or my eyes are all wrong... wait, is that a BALROGdown there singing?"   Truth to tell, the trio could see the camp teeming with Men,Elves, dragons, and even a few Ents and Hobbits.  Neither he nor Frodoknew anything of the duchy of Nurn away south in this wide realm,full of graduate students toiling in the fields by the dark sad watersof Lake Nurnenshire, nor of the great roads that ran away east andsouth to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower broughtlong waggon-trains of chocolate and booty and new dwellers in the camp.Here in the northward regions were the mines and forges, and themusterings of a long-planned conspiracy; and here the Dark Power,moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathering themtogether.  Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, hadbeen checked upon its western line, southward and northward.  Forthe moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing themabout Cirith Goofy for an avenging stroke.  And if it had also beenits purpose to defend the Mountain against all approach, it couldscarcely have done more.   Frodo squatted upon the outer marge of this strange and wondrouscommune, or so it seemed to him.  He sat thus while long hourswere measured by the wheeling clouds above him, noticing onlybelatedly, when his stomach began to growl, that Sam and Gulliblehad beaten a hasty retreat.  The hills echoed with his plaintivewails.   Meanwhile, more than half a league away, Sam and Gullible hadhardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud theyheard orc-voices.  Quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brownand stunted bush.  The voices drew nearer.  Presently five orcscame into view.  Four were clad in all-weather parkas of the kindFrodo had just thrown away; they were small, slack jawed andsharp-eyed, with wide nostrils at which they picked with the handsthat were not holding their short bows: evidently trackers of somekind.  The other was a large bearded orc, like those of Lugnardo'scompany, bearing the token of the Eye upon a great white apron.He wore a tall, bouffant hat and carried a short blade in one handand a pronged weapon in his other.  As usual they were quarrelling,and being of different nationalities they used the Common Speechinstead of the tongues of their old countries or the cant of theirrespective character classes.   Hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orcsstopped.  "Screw you guys!" the plumpest one snarled.  "I'm goinghome."  It pointed across the valley to the orc-hold.  "I'm not gonnawear my nose out on stones any more.  There's not a trace left, man.I've lost the scent thanks to your body odors.  They went up into thehills, not along the valley, I tell you."   "Not much use are you, big fat ass?" said one of the other trackers,wearing a blue and red helmet adorned with the Lidless Eye.   "Yeah, snot-nose!" chimed another, wearing a light greenishleather helm.   The last of the trackers, zipped tightly into his hooded orangeparka, mumbled an unintelligible phrase that Sam suspected wasobscene.   "Oh, yah?" snarled the first tracker.  "Up yours!  You don't evenknow what we're looking for!"   "It's not our fault we got bad information!" shouted the secondtracker.   "Yeah, you heard the Nazdaq!  He said there were nine people anda dragon we were after: two dragon-riders; a barbarian; fourhalflings, one woman and three men; an orc; and an Emberite. What aload of BS!" concluded the third.   "Yeah, those guys are on crack!" agreed the second.   "You idiots!" said the first tracker.  "YOU'RE on crack!  TheEmberite probably isn't even IN this shade anymore, and I've seenonly three sets of tracks, so he probably took the dragon and fiveof the people with him!"   "What do YOU know, big fat ass?!" shouted the second tracker.   "Yeah," added the third.  "Maybe the dragon took to the air andis carrying the rest."  At this the fourth tracker mumbled hisassent.   "Respect my authoritah, or ah'm gonna report you!"   "Who to?  Not to your precious Lugnardo!  He's the first onethose dragon-riders knocked senseless on their way in to get thehalflings!" laughed the third tracker.   "Whassa matter, fat ass, can't take the heat?" mocked the second.   The other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage."Ah... hate you gahs... SO MUCH..." he choked as he drew his bow.Suddenly he pointed it at the other three and released. The firsttwo dodged swiftly, but the arrow struck the last tracker squarelyin the torso.  Black blood began to stain his parka as he slumpedsoundlessly to the ground.   "Lord of Darkness!  He killed Snaga!" cried the second orc.   "You bastard!" shouted the third.   "Kids, kids!" cried the big orc.  "It's all right... you know,hunting the forces of light reminds me of a song that HE taught usto sing, all the way back in the First Age..."     You say you serve the Master...     But who's the boss of you?     Not just any old bastard     Vampire or Balrog, fool!     You gotta know who owns your soul     And if you done forget his name     He'll throw you in a bottomless hole     'Cause baby, he's the King of PAAAAAAAAIIIIN!     Tell me who's your Dark Lord, baaaaaby?     Don't give me no ifs, buts, or maaaybes!     He'll show you why hate is fun     'Cause he's the King of the Night     Drown Manwe, Varda and the sun!     And he's sexy like a barrow wiiiiight!     Now don't he look smooth like an evil god...     Time to make sweet looooove and a little pod!"Oops, sorry, children," muttered the singer abstractedly.   At this, Sam and Gullible snapped out of their trancelikestupor.  For a while they had sat in silence, listening with amixture of wonderment, shock, disgust, and bemusement, unable toturn away.  Now, Gullible stirred.  "Pods!  Who would have thoughtit, eh, saddam?   If this nice friendlinesss would spread aboutin Mordor, half our trouble would be over."   But the large orc was not finished.  "Ladies and gentleorcs, Mr.Elton John!" he cried, still oblivious to any onlookers exceptthe trackers.   "Quickly, Gullible," Sam whispered.  "There may be others about!"The hobbits took their leave while the leaving was good.   As they trudged on, Sam continued: "We have evidently had a verynarrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than weguessed.  I feared it was so.  But that is the spirit of Mordor,Gullible; and it has spread to every corner of it.  Orcs have alwaysbehaved like that, or so all the stereotypes say, when they are ontheir own.  But you can't get much hope out of it.  They hate ourquaint agrarian and semi-pastoral culture far more than they lovetheir strange mix of high- and low-brow entertainment.  If thosefive had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel untilwe were back in Sauron's grip.  This is what I came to understandat Sauron's retreat."   There was another long silence.  Sam broke it again, but with awhisper this time.  "Did you hear what they said about 'three malehalflings'?  But that means..." and they both turned in unison asif to look at Frodo, who was now so far behind them that theycould hardly spot even a speck on the horizon.   "I feared it was so," said Sam uncharacteristically, "I tellyou, when I think of that Frodo I get so hot I could disintegratehim right on the spot!"   Slowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been.A strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor fromthe upper airs.  Before long the hobbits could make out the shape ofthe land for some miles about them.  The trough between themountains and the Morgai had steadily dwindled as it climbedupwards, and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf in thesteep faces of the Ethel Duwap; but to the east it fell as sheerlyas ever down into the south parking lot of the Mall.  Ahead thewater-course came to an end in broken steps of rock; for out fromthe main range there sprang a high barren spur, thrusting eastwardlike a wall.  To meet it there stretched out from the grey and mistynorthern range of Ered Lithography a long jutting mass of stoneshaped like a giant beak: Carach Malden.  Between the ends there wasa narrow gap: the Orthancmouthe, beyond which lay the deep dale ofUfat.  In that dale behind the Morononn were the tunnels and deeparmouries that the servants of Mordor had made for the defence of theBlack Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was gathering inhaste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the West.Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, andwatch-fires burned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had beenraised, and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by asingle bridge.   A few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spurbranched away from the main range, Sam and Gullible quaked at thesign of doom that stood before them: the old castle ofWolfenstein, now one of the many orc-holds that clusteredabout the dale of Ufat.  A road, already visible in the growinglight, came winding down from it, until only a mile or two fromwhere the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cutin the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and onto the Orthancmouthe.   To the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journeynorth had been for nothing.  The plain to their right was filledwith flames, and they could see there neither camps nor troopsmoving; but all that region was under the vigilance of the fortsof Carach Malden.   "We have come to a dead end, Gullible," said Sam.  "If we go on,we shall only come up to that orc-castle, but the only road totake is that road that comes down from it - unless we fight ourway through, level by level.  I was never any good at those 3-Dfirst-person shooters."   Gullible crept out wearily, and flitting from stone to stonewith more than hobbit-care, he went down to the water-course, andthen followed it for some way as it climbed north, until he cameto the rock-steps where long ago, no doubt, its spring had comegushing down in a little waterfall.  All now seemed dry andsilent; but not wanting to go back and listen to Sam's disturbednightmare-mumblings, he stooped and listened, and to his relief hecaught the sound of trickling.  Clambering a few steps up hespotted Frodo standing over a tiny stream of dark water that cameout from the hill-side, and realized with some annoyance what sourceof the sound was.   When Frodo had finished defiling the water, Gullible clambered afew yards further upstream and tasted it, and it seemed good enough.Then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back.   "Well, luck did not let uss down," he muttered, "but that was anear thing!  Isn't it enough to have orcses by the thousand AND thepeople of Gondor on their way without that idiot hovering about,saddam?  If we catches him again, I'll have to kill him myself, orhe'll give uss away, or even the Fat Lord, saddam!"  He sat down bySam and did not rouse him, for fear that he'd have to listen to anall-night bleating, griping, whimpering, so-you-can't-sleep moan-fest.Proletarian or bourgeois, these Hobbiton types were all alike...stark raving insane.  But the wretch did not dare to go to sleephimself.  At last, when he felt his eyes closing and knew that hisstruggle to keep awake could not go on much longer, he wakened Sam,cringing.   "That Frodo is back again, Mr. Samwise," he said.  "If it wasn't him,then there iss two of him - ach, ss! - forget we said that, preciouss!"   "What?!  You mean he was here?  But he could have killed me,Gullible!" cried Sam.  "Why didn't you track him down and stun him withmy phaser?  He could have given our position to the orcs!  You'll gladlystrangle your own kind with or without the Ring, but a murdering sneakthief, noooo, those are your kind of people, or should I say yourILK--" Sam spat.   Gullible shook his head.  "Plus ca change, plus c'est le meme chose,"he muttered, an aphorism he had learned while in Sauron's keeping.   Some twelve miles further they halted, resting at a bend in theroad. They had hardly started on their way again when suddenly in thestillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they hadsecretly dreaded: the noise of singing. It was still some way behindthem, but even without looking back at the torch-bearing line, theycould hear voices, some droning monotonically, some chanting out ofkey, all in rapid onset.   "I feared it, Gullible," said Sam, receiving a dirty look in return."We've trusted to luck, and it has failed us.  We're trapped at last!"he said.  He sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and fingeredthe safety catch of his phaser.  Gullible sat down wearily beside him.   They did not have to wait long.  The orcs were going at a greatpace.  This group, short and squat, seemed to have skin with alight blue tinge and the maws of the soldiers gaped to animpossible size.  Those in the foremost files bore torches.  Onthey came, red flames in the dark, swiftly growing.  Now Sam toobowed his head and covered their feet with backpacks, hoping thatit would hide their appearance when the singers reached them; butat length he realized that it was impossible to blend into thiscrowd.   "If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tiredstudents alone and pass on!" he thought.   And so it seemed that they would.  The leading orcs came lopingalong, panting, holding their heads down.  They were a gang ofthe smaller half-Toon breeds being driven unwilling to theirDark Lord's wars; all they cared for was to get the march overand be able to stop singing.     We don't want to look like Toons today     But the Animé Lords say "Nay, nay, nay!"     We're gonna sing all day, all day, all day!     Where there's some Dip there's a way!Beside them, hovering up and down the line, went two of the largefierce daleks, flicking wet brushes at the feet of the orcsand muttering "DIS-IN-TE-GRATE!".  File after file passed, and thetell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead.  Sam held his breath.Now more than half the line had gone by.  Then suddenly one of theslave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side.  He flicked abrush at them and yelled: "GET-UP!"  They did not answer, andwith a monotonic whistle he halted the whole company.   "REBELS OF MORDOR, THIS IS YOUR LAST OFFER - OUR FINAL WARNING.LEAVE YOUR RESTING PLACE.  JOIN THE WAR-MARCH.  YOU WILL BE FED ANDWATERED.  WORK IS NEEDED FROM YOU - BUT THE DALEK-HAI OFFER YOULIFE.  DESERT YOUR POST AND THE DALEK-HAI WILL DIP YOU ANDOBLITERATE YOUR INKS COMPLETELY.  YOU WILL DIE.  TRACKERS,SOLDIERS, PODS.  THE DALEK-HAI OFFER YOU LIFE!!!"   Feeling a strange animosity in response to the use of all-caps andmultiple exclamation points, they struggled to their feet, andkeeping bent, limping like footsore soldiers, they shuffled backtowards the rear of the line.  "NO-NO, NOT-AT-THE-REAR!!" theslave-driver shouted.  "RANK-THREE, FILE-TWO-AND-THREE!"  He senthis long Dip-impregnated brush whistling over their heads and theyfeigned fear; then with another long tone he started the company offagain at a brisk trot.   It was hard enough for poor Sam, who had painted the doors in BagEnd without adequate ventilation on many a summer evening; but forGullible it was a torment, and soon a nightmare.  He set his teeth,trying to stop his head from spinning at the fumes, and hestruggled on.  The stench of both inks and solvent dripping fromthe singing orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp andcough.  On, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw hisbreath and to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil endhe toiled and endured he did not dare to think.  There was no hopeof falling out unseen: Now and again the orc-driver fell back andbeeped at them.   "DIS-IN-TE-GRATE!" he jeered, flicking the brush at their legs."KEEP-SINGING!  WHERE THERE'S SOME DIP THERE'S A WAY!"  The voiceof the dalek held nearly no modulation.   They had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down along slope into the plain, when Gullible's strength began to give outand his will wavered.  He lurched and stumbled.  Desperately, Samtried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himselfhardly stay the pace much longer.  At any moment now he knew that theend would come: the weakling would faint or fall, and all would bediscovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain.  "I'll have that bigslave-driving monstrosity with this phaser, anyway," he thought.   Then just as he was putting his hand to the handle of the phasepistol, there came an unexpected relief.  They were out on the plainnow and drawing near the entrance to Ufat.  Some way in front of it,before the gate at the bridge-end, the road from the west convergedwith others coming from the south, and from Barad-dur.  Along all theroads troops were moving; for the Captains of the West wereadvancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his forces north.  So itchanced that several companies - Toons, half-Toons, and full-bloodedorcs - came together at the road-meeting, in the dark beyond thelight of the watch-fires on the wall.  At once there was greatjostling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gateand the ending of their songs.  Though the drivers yelled and pliedtheir dips (or whips), scuffles broke out and some gun arms weredeployed.  A troop of heavily-studded daleks from Barad-dur chargedinto the Durthang line and threw them into confusion.   Dazed as he was with the awful mind-numbing singing, Sam woke up,grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground,dragging Gullible down with him.  As they fell, one of the toon orcsbehind them was blasted by an enemy dalek gun and went spinninginto oblivion.  Slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away outof the escalating melee, until at last unnoticed they dropped overthe further edge of the road.  It had a magnetized guardrail bywhich even the headless troop-leaders could guide themselves, andit was banked up some feet above the level of the open land.   They lay still for a while.  It was too dark to seek for cover, ifindeed there was any to find; but Sam felt that they ought at least toget further away from the highways and out of the range of dalekbiosensors.   "Come on, ye git!" he whispered.  "One more crawl, and then you canlie still."   With a last despairing effort Gullible raised himself on his hands,and struggled on for maybe twenty yards.  Then he pitched down intoa shallow pit that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he laylike a dead thing.
  As the grey light of morning came again to Mordor, Sam woke and lookedabout the hollow where he and Gulible had taken refuge the previousnight.  A foul sump of oily water ringed with lurid algae lay at itsbottom, and as he slept Sam had slid down nearly to its edge.  Guliblewas nowhere to be seen.  Unwilling yet to move, Sam thought through the whirlwind of eventsthat had landed him in this unhappy place.  Affection, revenge, andsimple inertia had carried him this far, but weariness at last led himto frankly consider the task that lay ahead.  "Was this the job I was hired to do when I started?" Sam askedhimself.  "To help Mr. Frodo into his inheritance and then die withhim?  Well, that is my job, but I'm nowt but a ninnyhammer if I gothrough with it.  I would dearly like to see Bywater again, with Rosieleading the Revolution at my side.  Much as I'd like to see Mr. Frododraw his last breath, this quest is useless; it's high time I cut mylosses and head home.  "Still," he thought, "I can't think somehow that Gandalf and Elrondwould have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there hadn't a' been anyhope of his coming back with more money for them to take.  What do Ihave to show for all the work I've done these past months?  A deedsigned over that nobody will believe, Mr. Frodo gone so I can't bringhim back to the Shire to set off the Revolution, and a lot o' wastedblackmail that won't do no good either way.  If I'm to get anythingout of this at all, the Ring must go into the Fire and Frodo's got tolive through it... for a little while.  Why am I left all alone tomake up my mind?"  At that thought, Sam began to wonder where Gulible had gone.  Hebent his knees to stand, only to find that his feet had dipped downnear the water in the night and were now covered by a thin layer ofruby red growth, moist and sparkling in the growing daylight.  With acry he scraped the algae away as best he could, using dirt and gravelto scour it off.  Eventually the worst was gone, and all that was leftwas a light silvery sheen that persisted for days.  Sam walked up out of the hollow.  The land all about was dreary,flat, and drab-hued: a sparsly populated urban wasteland strugling tomaintain a meager existence between the inhabited regions of Mordor.Wide and featureless vacant lots, some dry and barren, some filledwith tall brown grasses, were interspersed with occasional buildings:broken and tumbled remnants of failed restaurants, motels, andconvenience marts lined the roads.  A few miles to the north-west, apair of long-abandoned apartment buildings stood like sombre greyghosts, for few would tolerate the long commute.  South-eastward, faroff like an erect sapphire tower, rose the Mountain.  Strange smokesspilled forth from its peak and rolled down its sides to the plainsbelow.  Nothing was moving in the direction of the crossroads where they hadmade their escape, but Sam thought he saw a distant hint of motion tothe east.  A great thoroughfare led that way: the road that led to theDark Tower itself.  Its golden cobblestones were worn and dirty withthe passage of many feet, but it remained in good repair, and takingcare not to be seen Sam nevertheless moved quickly.  Soon a small figure came in view, dancing wildly in the middle of thepath.  Sam crept forward stealthily, until finally he peered out frombehind a crumbling wall only to see that the flailing form was that ofGulible, who was not just dancing but singing as well.  He marvelledthat anyone other than Tom Bombadil could spout such nonsense.  Buthis amusement soon turned to alarm, for Sam heard far off a noise oftramping feet and harsh voices: Orcs were coming up the road fromBarad-dur, and soon Gulible's crazed behavior would mean discovery andtorture for them both.  Sam leapt from his hiding place and shoved the loony off the path,tackling him to the ground on the far side where they were hidden bythe tall growth.  As the maniac lay on the grass, Sam held his mouthclosed to keep him silent.  At first, Gulible struggled to break free,but as the Orcs drew nearer he went silent and limp.  Intent on theirdestination, the Orcs passed swiftly without so much as a glance toeither side.  Their voices receded into the distance, and Sam finallyremoved his hand allowed Gulible to speak.  "Ach, thanks," he said.  "We was thirsty, yess, and we sipped fromthe water where we slept."  At this, Sam realized that what he hadtaken for dirt on Gulible's face was in fact a residue of dull brownishmold.  "We thinks just a few sipses couldn't hurt, saddam, but onewas enough.  It tickled our throat, yes, and burned our brain intodust.  Dusst!  We didn't come to our senses until you knocked us down,no, saddam."  "Well," said Sam, "I've been thinking a bit, and I reckon that goingon to the Mountain will be the end of us, like as not.  Maybe we'dbest be getting away while there's a chance, and leave this drearyland to Sauron and Mr. Frodo."  "It mustn't say such things!" exclaimed Gulible with unexpectedforce. "The Precious must go into the Fire, yess, or else we'll neverbe normal again, no, saddam.  It gnaws at our mind all the time,saddam, near or far, filling us with longings and lusst.  If thePrecious goes we'll have a healthy brain again, yes, and p'raps otherrewards, too."  "But see here, Gulible: I want to get home again, and that's a fact.Throwing the Ring into the Mountain won't help much if we don't liveto enjoy it.  How can we get back once it's gone?"  "We'll tell you," he croaked, looking sidelong at Sam with a glintin his eyes.  "We has a plan, yes, a way back when the Precious isgone. All arranged in advance it is, yes, very secret, but we knows it.Let Don Giovanni show you!"  "A way back!" said Sam doubtfully, looking down at Gulible withsearching eyes.  "Why didn't you tell me about this, or Mr. Frodo?"  "You didn't ask, saddam.  But now you say: let's go home.  So DonGiovanni is very afraid.  He wants to be rid of the Precious, andwe're so close, yes, never have the chance again.  So Don Giovanniwill share his secret, saddam, when times is right."  "Gulible," Sam said, "I don't like trusting you, but it don't seemas I've got much choice, if I'm t' get any good out of this quest atall. We need to move quickly, so let's trust to luck again and followthe road.  We're off to seek the Mountain!"  The two travellers returnedto the path, heading east into darkness.  Days passed as the companions walked mile after bitter mile towardSauron's fortress.  Their provisions dwindled quickly, until they wereleft with no food but the twinkies of the Elves.  They did notsatisfy desire, or for that matter do much to keep the wanderers ontheir feet at all.  And yet as they relied on it alone, this waybreadof the Elves gained a potency that the travellers did not suspect, fortheir bodies were filled with preservatives, so that even after deaththeir corpses would endure beyond the measure of mortal kind.  More pressing was their need for water.  "Water, water!" mutteredSam, much to the frustration of Gulible who was trying to ignore his owngrowing thirst.  Neither of them were willing any longer to touch thefew dubious pools of standing water that lingered in scattered basinsbeside the road.  They had last filled their bottles at a fast foodFrench restaurant a day ago, but the exorbitant price of bottled waterin this harsh place had cost them their last penny; there was no hopeof any more.  Eventually, the road drew even with their goal: looming above theruins of an old motel on their right, the blue-tinged tower of MountViagra gleamed in the fading light.  Fumes and smokes began to taintthe air, adding to their thirst.  They sought shelter for the night inthe abandoned motel, but sleep long evaded them.  Dream and wakingmingled uneasily, a sure sign that their all-twinkie diet wasgetting the best of them.  As the night grew old, they were awakened by noises like the pitifulcries of a tortured thing.  Creeping through the ruins, they came upona wimpering creature dressed in Orcish garb lying stiff on the ground,its hands clenched into fists.  Tears seeped from its closed eyes, andit began to chant as if to itself: "I'd be tender, I'd be gentle, andawful sentimental regarding Orcish art!  I'd be friends with thebarrows and the Orcs who shoot the arrows if you wouldn't break myheart!  Just because you're presumin' that I am some kind-a-human, youwent and broke my heart!"  "Spiegel?!" exclaimed Sam.  "Who--Sam?" she replied, confused as she woke from her own uneasysleep.  Her voice still seemed full of the pain that had filled herdreams.  "What are you doing here?"  "That's what I was just going t' ask you," he said, holding Gulibleback.  A long, lingering hug from Don Giovanni seemed to be the lastthing she would need in her current state.  "We're off to theMountain.  But I thought you'd gone off with Corbin, and Gorbush."  "Corbin did just as he promised," she said, sitting up andstraightening the Orcish cloak around her shoulders.  "He took us to aworld where the Orcs were truly happy, where they could be their ownmasters, free from the hatred of foe and overlord alike that surroundsthem here.  Gorbush and I looked on that world with joy, but myhappiness was short-lived.  For the first time, Gorbush was among Orcswho were not slaves at heart: Orcish women with the same independentspirit that drew him to me.  The last I saw, he was chasing after someOrc-hussy named Lartip.  He never even said goodbye.  "When Corbin stopped by to visit, he offered to bring me back here.I just haven't had the heart to move yet; I feel all hollow and emptyinside.  I just want to sleep."  Wrapping her cloak tightly aroundher, Spiegel curled into a protective little ball on the floor.  Samand Gulible lay back down nearby, and they all tried to get such restas they could before the dawn.  The light of morning slowly filtered through the haze thatsurrounded the Mountain, and a dim semblance of daylight grew aboutthem. Gulible packed up their things, leaving behind some old blanketsand cooking supplies that they no longer needed.  Sam stood besideSpiegel, who was once again lying stiff and immobile on the ground."Wake up, Spiegel!" he said.  "Time for another journey."  She opened her eyes, but did not rise.  "I can't manage it, Sam,"she said.  "It is so hard to go on alone, so hard."  Sam knew before he spoke that such words might do more harm thangood, but his feelings for the girl were still strong and he could notkeep silent.  "Then come with us for a bit, Spiegel," he said.  "Youknow we'd welcome you, and gladly.  Where else would you go?"  "I wasn't sure," she replied.  "I thought at first that I might joinback with Sauron so that I could work to make the Orcs' lives betterhere; that's why Corbin dropped me off here near his tower.  But thenI thought of the happiness of the Orcs I had seen living free of hisdomination, and I couldn't bear to go back to him.  I don't know whatto do.  It's hard to make choices with a broken heart."  Sam nodded.  "It is," he said.  "But I've been thinking, maybe yourbroken heart could be healed by doing a good deed, by bringing freedomto all the Orcs in Sauron's realm.  Isn't helping them what you'vereally wanted all this time?"  "Yes," she said tentatively, "yes it is.  I don't need to be an Orcto help the Orcs!  I can love all the Orcish people even if my heartdoesn't belong to any of them."  She paused.  "Even if it belonged tosomeone else."  As if roused by a sudden bell, Spiegel rose quickly, and stood upand looked away southwards.  She threw off her black cloak, her heavybelt, and even her dress: all gifts from Gorbush.  She stood therelithe and beautiful, clad only in her undergarments, and her red hairand green eyes glinted in the dim light.  "There, I'll be an Orc nomore," she cried.  "Let him hate me, if he will.  We're off to seekthe Mountain!"  At last the three companions turned their faces to Mount Viagra andset out.  Their spirits were higher than could be expected from theirpoor night's sleep.  It helped that Spiegel had a little water toshare, the last of what was left for her by Corbin.  Even a mouthfulhelped tremendously, and the Mountain's fumes did not hurt theirthroats quite as much as they had the previous day.  In fact, Sam andGulible found that the tainted air seemed somehow to stiffen theirresolve, helping them rise to the challenge that lay before them.Spiegel felt no such inspiration, but she was not as weary as theywere, and drew fresh strength from her recovering spirits.  The land was rough and hostile, and yet they made much progress, andever the Mountain drew nearer.  No buildings were to be found here,far from the road, and the fields were overgrown and untended.  Latein the afternoon they walked through a field of poppies, and Sam wassurprised to find himself making a mental note to tell Morrie aboutthe prospects for opium exports here.  Now the bulk of Mount Viagraloomed vast before them: a huge mass of ash and slag wreathed inbluish fumes, out of which a sheer-sided shaft stabbed skyward intothe clouds.  All too soon the light began to fail, and the renewed hope andstrength that had carried them through the day began to falter in thegrowing dark.  Sam and Spiegel trudged slower and slower, and Guliblebegan to stagger as the harsh air and long march finally took theirtoll.  At the base of the Mountain, he sank down and said: "I'mthirsty, Sam," and did not speak again.  Sam gave him a mouthful oftheir precious water, and Gulible quickly fell into a deep sleep, hisbreath rattling in his chest.  Sam and Spiegel tried to rest as well, but all the doubts that theyhad set aside in the light of day came back to haunt them that night.As they both tossed and turned, Sam's spirits sank lower than they hadin days.  Tears welled in his eyes at the thought that he might neversee his Rosie again.  Desperate to focus on a pleasant thought, hespoke quietly to Spiegel: "Do you remember our time in the hot towerin Disgiliath, the day we met the eagle?"  For several slow heartbeats, Spiegel was silent.  "I know that suchthings happened," she finally said, "but it seems so very long ago.Since Gorbush left me, no taste of food, no feel of water, no memoryof tree or grass or flower have any meaning for me."  She paused for amoment, and then two.  "I am naked in the dark, Sam."  The seconds passing in the night seemed endless, timeless.  At lasthe groped for Spiegel's hand.  It was cold and trembling.  She wasshivering.  "I didn't ought to have left my blanket behind," muttered Sam; andlying down he tried to comfort Spiegel with his arms and body.  Sleeptook them, and the dim light of the last day of their quest found themside by side, as slowly the light of the unseen Sun filtered down intothe shadows where the three hobbits lay.  "Wake up, wake up!  Wake up, sleepies!" Gulible croaked, clawing atSam and Spiegel where they lay.  "No time to lose.  We must go, yes,we must go at once.  No time to lose!"  Spiegel sat up suddenly andseized him by the arm, and then pulled herself to her feet.  Samgroaned, but with a great effort of will he staggered up as well.  Asense of urgency which he did not understand came to him, and he sawthat the others also seemed to have felt the call.  "We sees something," Gulible whispered nervously, "something movingaround the base of the Mountain, saddam.  Don Giovanni tries tofollow, saddam, but it was tricksy, yes, and it slipped away."  "Could it have been Mr. Frodo?" Sam asked.  "Frodo?" asked Spiegel.  "I assumed he had gone back to study withSauron.  What would he be doing here?"  "He got distracted, yes, went off on his own," answered Gulible."Maybe he wants to help destroy the Precious."  Turning to Sam, hesaid, "P'raps it was him, yes, but it looked too big.  More like awraith, saddam, tall and pale, or some other nasty thing.  Maybeeven the Dark Lord himself, saddam."  With Gulible's warning, they all began to peer nervously from side toside.  "Frodo and Sauron an wraiths, oh my!" Spiegel exclaimed, andthose fears drove them to press on.  The three companions began to ascend the base of the Mountain.  Therewhere it met the plain, the air was full of fumes, making breathingpainful and difficult.  Sam and Gulible found that the enhanced vigorthat had sustained them the previous day had given way overnight to apainful tension with no hope of release, and Spiegel began to choke onthe foul air.  As they went on, one by one they slipped to the groundand crawled on their hands and knees, until at last their wills coulddrive them no further and their limbs gave way.  They lay together on the slope, panting for breath.  They soonrealized that they had climbed more than half way up the Mountain'sbase, and had risen above the worst of the reeks that coiled anddrifted down below.  Their strength gradually returned.  After a fewminutes, Gulible asked, "How far iss there to go?"  "I don't know," said Sam, "because I don't know where we're going."  Slowly, Gulible and Spiegel turned to face Sam, as the disbelief ontheir faces changed to raw anger.  "You WHAT?" yelled Spiegel.  Hersudden fury seemed to bring her new strength.  "You DON'T KNOW?  Youbrought us all the way here to destroy the Ring without knowing whatto do when we got here?  Were you going to mention this at some point,or did you plan to wait until we'd climbed to the very top of thisblasted slagheap?"  "I thought it would be obvious!" Sam answered.  "I mean, how hardcould it be to find the Cracks of Doom once we got here?"  The othersjust stared.  "Frodo was the one who learned all the maps!"  "Well he's not here now," said Spiegel.  "Yes, he is," said a voice.  Turning, they saw a shocking sight:before them stood Frodo, but grotesquely changed.  Whatever strangeand dreadful paths he had trodden, driven by a devouring desire, theyhad left grievous marks on him.  Fully six feet tall he stood, thinand haggard, all bones and tight-drawn skin.  There was no hair to beseen anywhere on his body, and there were open sores on his forehead.He wore nothing but a scrap of cloth wrapped about his loins, and hissparkling white stone dangled on a chain about his neck.  A wild, madlight flamed in his eyes.  "Give me the Ring!  Once it is gone, theNurnenshire estate will be mine!  Give it to me!"  "Frodo, what happened?" asked Sam.  "What in Middle-earth hashappened to you?"  The overgrown hobbit paid no attention.  Towering over Sam he cried,"It is mine, I say!  Give me the Ring, NOW!"  "I don't have it," said Sam, as calmly as he could manage.  "You WHAT?" yelled Spiegel and Gulible together, staring at him ineven greater amazement than before.  "Then where is it?  Tell me!" demanded Frodo.  "I'm really not sure," said Sam, relishing his old master'sfrustration.  "But I know for a fact that either you have it, orGulible does."  Gulible yelped with surprise and fear as the gigantic Frodo whirledto face him.  "No, no, saddam, we doesn't have it, we doesn't."  Frodo was not appeased.  "Now, now!" he gasped, clutching at Gulible'sbreast.  "Now, you creeping thing, give me the Ring!  You cannotbetray me now!"  So strange was the tableau that it seemed to Sam that he saw thesetwo rivals with some bizarre other vision.  A crouching shape, scarcelymore than a shadow of his younger self, a creature now wholly raggedand dejected, yet filled with great confusion and fear; and before itstood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure hairless and white, butfrom deep in its gut there came a resounding growl.  Out of the growlthere spoke a commanding voice.  "Hand over the Ring, and trouble me no more!  If you touch it everagain, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom."  The crouching shape shrank away, terror in its blinking eyes, when anew figure came in view.  It was Spiegel, and she reached up high andslapped Frodo squarely on the cheek.  "Shame on you!" she scolded,staring up at him with her hands on her hips.  "What did you do that for?  I didn't hurt him," said Frodo, beginningto cry.  "You didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nosebleeding?"  "Well, of course not.  What a fuss you're making!  When you goaround picking on people weaker than you are... why, you're nothing buta great big coward!"  "I know," he sobbed, "I know.  I've felt so odd lately... I feel allthin, sort of stretched.  And my head is always hurting, and I'vebeen hounded by foul-mouthed Orcs, and I haven't slept in days... andnow you've all gotten so short and you're keeping the Ring from me andI'll never get my estate need to destroy it before I get the estateI'm thirsty very thirsty hungry all being so cruel don't know what todo..."  He fell flat upon the ground and whimpered.  "It's because of the Precious," guessed Gulible.  "He's like thisbecause of the nasty Ring, yes, and the sooner we get rid of it, thesooner he'll rest, saddam.  Now where iss it?" he asked, turning toSam.  "I fed it to one of you in a twinkie," Sam admitted.  "I don't knowwhich.  But I figure you're right: destroying the Ring will probablybe good for him.  Not that I'd mind if it wasn't!"  Sam looked at Frodo.  "Oh, curse you, you imperialist pig!"  hemuttered to himself.  Out loud, he asked, "Can you take us to theCracks of Doom?  Do you know the way?"  Frodo lifted his head, with only a trace of hope in his eyes.  Hespoke quietly, almost in a whisper.  "Yes, I will come.  There's apath not far up the slope from here; it will take us where we need togo."  They helped him to his feet, and as they all began to climbagain, Frodo gazed up and ahead.  "We're off to seek the Mountain!" hesaid.  They soon reached the path that Frodo had spoken of.  They did notknow it, but it was in fact the tail end of Sauron's Road fromBarad-dur, the same gold-paved road that they had followed before,eastward from Ufat toward the Dark Tower.  The four of them walkedslowly but with confidence up that climbing road, winding back andforth up the mountainside.  With a last eastward bend, it passed in acutting along the face of the shaft and came to the dark door in theMountain's side.  Facing that door across the intervening miles, the pinnacle ofBarad-dur seemed to gaze directly on the hobbits.  The hobbits paidlittle attention, focusing instead on the terrible door.  For a momentthey stood at the gaping mouth, their hearts beating with nervousfear, and then they plunged in, giving no thought to the Freudianimplications of that act.  Fearfully, they took a few uncertain steps into the dark, and thenall at once there came a flash of purple: vivid red fires leaped upwardand smote the high blue roof.  As the light flashed, a deep voice sangas if from nowhere and echoed about the cavern:    "DOOM!  The Cracks... of DOOM!"They all spun around, this way and that, but no trace of a singercould be seen.  When a few moments had passed without further musicalaccompaniment, they all relaxed.  "This is a mighty strange place,"said Sam, "and that's a fact."  In the flash, they had seen that theywere in a long tunnel that bored straight into the Mountain's hotcenter.  Only a short way ahead, its floor and the walls on eitherside were split by a great fissure, out of which the purple glarecame, now leaping up, now dying down exhausted; and all the while farbelow there was a continuous groaning noise as of great enginesthrobbing and laboring.  They walked to the brink of the chasm, to the very Crack of Doom,and just as they reached the edge the light sprang up again, and thedeep ringing voice returned to its ominous song:    "The Chambers of Fire... the Fires of DOOM.""That could get a bit annoying," said Sam.  Frodo, his unnaturally tall body silhouetted against the pulsatinglight, now spoke in a compelling voice.  "Who now is the bearer of theRing?  The wearer of the Ring?"  The others hung their heads, but saidnothing: they were filled with thoughts of darkness and despair, andthey had no answer for him.  "Beware!  Its mighty power has yet to beshown!"  Frodo turned to them in madness and anger, ready to take theRing from its bearer by force if need be.  He lunged forward, but hadno chance to act, for at that moment many things happened.  A great rush of wind came from outside, a sound like the beating ofvast wings.  At the same time, something struck Sam violently in theback, a huge ball that bowled all four of them to the ground.  It slidwith terrible speed toward the fissure, and slipped in... only tobecome lodged in the crack by virtue of its considerable girth.Slowly, arms and legs reached out and grasped for purchase on thenearby rocks.  Then, the obese man raised his head.  It was Gandalf.  "Fat Lord!" said Gulible, "I've brought them here, yes, just asI was told.  The Precious, too, and we're ready to throw it in,saddam.  Only..."  The wizard tried to pull himself up out of the crack, but the samebulk that had saved him remained caught on the jagged rock at itsedge.  Gulible ran forward and began to help pull him to safety.  AsGandalf twisted and Gulible tugged, a sudden tearing sound was heard,followed by the sound of a balloon quickly deflating.  Gandalfstruggled up into the tunnel with his robes now hanging loose abouthim and a great punctured inner tube drooping below them to theground.  "Only what?"  he asked.  "Only the nasty hobbit put it in our food, saddam!" said Gulible,getting the words out in a rush.  Gandalf surveyed the situation, consternation on his face.  Thenwith a suddenness that startled them all he started laughing!  "Eatme to be tall!" he cried.  "Of course, of course!"  With an evil lightin his eye, he jumped on Frodo and tried to drag him into the fissure.  Sam and Spiegel lay on the floor of the tunnel in shock, still dazedfrom their fall and the strange events that had followed.  Whatfollowed transpired so quickly that they had no chance to act, butcould only watch in awe and horror.  Frodo on the edge of the abysswas fighting like a mad thing with his murderous foe.  Gandalf pressedhim hard, but Frodo's newfound size gave strength to his desperationand he began to make progress, fighting his way away from the Fire.  Suddenly, Gulible leapt into the fray, grabbing Frodo's knees andtripping him.  The three combatants swayed to and fro, so near thebrink that they almost tumbled in, and then they all fell to theground.  Gandalf landed on top of Frodo, and as Frodo struggled torise Gandalf tried to keep him down.  He grabbed hold of the chainaround Frodo's neck and choked the hobbit to the floor, but with asharp twist the chain snapped and came loose in Gandalf's hand.However, the wizard did not lose his grip, but caught hold of Frodo'sshoulders and pinned him to the ground.  They were locked in astalemate: Frodo could not rise, but Gandalf could not budge himtoward the Fire.  But they had forgotten Gulible!  As Gandalf pinned Frodo's shouldersand prevented his escape, Gulible clawed at his belly.  Suddenly Samsaw Gulible's hands spread apart; his white teeth gleamed, and thensnapped as they bit.  Frodo began to scream in horror and agony, forGulible continued gnawing into Frodo's gut, searching for the Ring.The screaming went on and on, and then Gulible leapt to his feet,crying out in triumph with the Ring clenched between his teeth.Gandalf turned to look, and at that moment Frodo lashed out with afoot and kicked Gulible in the groin.  Gulible gasped with pain, and then went wide-eyed in terror as,gulp, down went the Ring into his own throat.  They all stared athim, as he began to gibber at them, shrinking back toward the chasm infear.  "No, no, saddam, it didn't happen.  It can be fixed, yes.We'll throw up the Ring!  Just give us a little time, just a little,saddam!"    Frodo stared up at Gulible with a hungry, greedy gaze.  "No, Frodo,"gasped Gulible, recognizing his deadly peril and the thread upon whichhis doom now hung, "search your feelings!"  Then Frodo stirred and spoke with a greedy voice, a voice louder andmore piercing than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above thethrobs and groans of the Mountain, ringing in the roof and walls.  "Iwill not wait now to do what I came to do," he said.  "I will notawait the Ring.  The Deed is mine!"  And Frodo kicked Gulible firmlyin the knees.  He toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and thenwith a shriek he fell.  Out of the depths came his last wail, and hewas gone.  With a great roar, fires leapt up and licked the roof as the Ring andits final bearer were consumed.  Gazing through the door into thedistance they saw a vision of ruin: towers fell and mountains slid;walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke andspouting steams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like anoverwhelming wave; and then at last over the miles between there camea rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook; andwe all desperately wished that we didn't now have such a tragically,horrifyingly vivid understanding of this scene.  They all stared out the door at the cloud of black dust that cloakedthe ruins of Barad-dur, stared until the last rumblings of itscollapse died away.  They all knew that no body could survive thatdevastation: for good or ill, Sauron was no more.  Sam, Spiegel, andFrodo all looked at each other with guarded hope: were their goals inreach at last?  Were they worth the price?  Then, out of the darkness by the Crack of Doom there came anunexpected sound: Gandalf had begun to laugh an evil laugh.  Thehobbits turned to face him, and for the first time saw that he worethree glittering Rings on his right hand.  Nenya, the Ring ofZirconium, nabbed from Galadriel's nightstand while she was helpingCeleborn to dress himself.  Pinta, the Ring of Tinted Glass, won fromEl Rond in a game of cards after he was convinced it would lose itspowers when the One was destroyed.  And Dubya, the Ring of HeNe,"borrowed" from Cirdan two thousand years ago when Gandalf claimed tohave misplaced his laser pointer right before giving a lecture.  "Sauron is dead," he said.  "I can sense it.  I can sense it!  TheRings give me powers beyond my wildest dreams, and my last rival forthe Overlordship of Middle-earth is no more!  What can I not do inthis hour?  The Rings will give me power of Command!"  The wizardbegan to stride up and down along the abyss, speaking ever moreloudly.  He seemed to have entirely forgotten Frodo and the others,and his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the mustering of men.  Ashe spoke, the aura of power about him seemed to grow stronger andstronger, almost as if evil energy was visibly flowing into his body.The hobbits cowered away from him in growing fear.  After several minutes, he reached a fevered pitch.  "Then I willbring the might of Gondor down on the Easterlings.  Once they are mysubjects, it will be time for the greatest crusade yet, for we shallwipe the vile race of Orcs from the face of the world."  At this,Spiegel choked, but said nothing.  He went on, "After scouring theirilk from Mordor, it will be easy to sweep on to the south and captureHarad.  And then, oh yes, then it will be time to turn on the Elvesand pay them back for all the humiliation they've caused me over theyears.  I will raze all of their precious forests!  I'll see them cutto the ground one by one, even if it takes all the saws here in Mordorto do it!"  As Gandalf spoke those words, a bright glow sprang up from his lefthand and it became more brilliant by the second.  Before Gandalf hadmore than a moment to register the light coming from Frodo's stone, abloodcurdling shriek tore through the chamber.  "MINE!"  A blade whirled and flashed in the growing light as Maglor leapt fromhis hiding place in the shadows and charged straight at Gandalf.Startled, the wizard stepped back and raised his right hand to strikethe Elf down with his Rings of Power.  He stepped too far.  With a cry, he tumbled backwards, arms spinning,even as Maglor slashed at his falling body.  No longer protected byhis balloon padding, the wizard plunged into the fiery pit and wasdestroyed.  As the Three Rings perished with their wearer, flames thrice asintense as before burst forth from the depths of Mount Viagra,liquifying the roof of the cavern and bathing Maglor and the hobbitsin an unholy radiance.  Fire belched from the Mountain's summit, andthe earth began to shake.  Through all this, Maglor didn't move, butstood staring down at the crack where Gandalf had fallen.  The hobbitsfelt no such compulsion to stay: Sam and Spiegel lifted Frodo, who hadfinally collapsed from pain and exhaustion, and carried him out thedoor.  "Well, this is the end, Sam Gamgee," said a voice by his side.  Andthere was Spiegel, pale and tired and yet herself again, the lovelyhobbit lass Sam had shared such joy with in Disgiliath.  The Orcs hadbeen saved from both slavery and extermination; her burden was takenaway.  "Spiegel!" cried Sam, and taking her in his arms he kisssed her onthe lips.  For in this moment he thought nothing of Rosie or of theRevolution to come, but only this: here and now, they were alive.  "I am glad you are here with me," said Spiegel.  "Here at the end ofall things, Sam."
  "What are they?" Aragon asked and stared out over the milling crowds.Their joyous squeals and raucous hollers reached even the highest tower,their brightly coloured garments could not be ignored by the mostcolourblind of absent minds. Gondor had indeed been invaded.  "Don't worry about it, dear," Arwen said and put her arm over a smallportion of his shoulders. "The people of Mordor have a right to be jollyafter decades of hardship and high culture, haven't they? If they want tolook outrageous, so be it. Now put on that costume and let me have a lookat you!"  Aragon sighed and wriggled into a pair of very green tights. "I can't say Ilike performing for Orcs," he said. "Not to mention the Southrons; they laughand make obscene gestures at me."  Arwen gave him a motherly smile. "It's their culture, darling!" sheexplained. "And remember, they aren't called Orcs or Southrons anymore. Keepyour manners and call them Mordorians - please?"  She helped him button his shirt, a voluminous tent gleaming venomously likethe skin of a serpent dying from envy, and the matching vest in avocado.Aragon gave himself a quick glance in the wall-covering mirror, then lookedaway with a grimace. "I don't like this," he said. "I don't like it at all."He attempted to make the puppy-eyed face that made her heart melt likemarshmallows in a campfire, but all the green seemed to take away its effect.  "Yes, my snake, it is necessary," Arwen said firmly. "We couldn't possiblythrow away a golden opportunity like this. Ariëlle has hinted that we mightget even higher positions here, if we perform well and she decides to go on amission to save the world or something. Who knows, we might be King and Queenof Gondor yet!" She threw off her cape, and stood before him in a silverbathing suit and feathers and little else. "And until that day, we will bethe Fairy King and Queen of Goldywood." She gave a wry smile. "Isn't itamazing how these concept writers can twist and pervert the most simpleidea?"  "There will be no twisting or perversion in my Gondor!" Ariëlleexclaimed cheerfully as she barged into the room without knocking. "Unlessthey can come up with a new way of twisting that fits the Park's concept, ofcourse. Hey, what do you think about these? 'Buy your own Ring ofDestruction'." She held out a tray of brightly coloured rings and a wizardlydoll that looked somewhat like Gandalf. "He's fully de- and reflatable," shesaid proudly as Arwen reached out to touch his rubbery features.  "Uh - wasn't it called the Ring of Seduction?" Aragon asked serpently,shifting uncomfortably in his new costume.  Ariëlle just gave him a stare. "What kind of place do you think this is?"she asked sternly. "And may I kindly request you not to adjust your pantsin public? It's not fitting." She looked at her watch, which was large andsparkly and decorated with a miniature replica of Gondor. "All right,lovedoves, it's time," she said with a grin. "Break a leg, huh?"  Aragorn put on his mask, which, at three times the size of his head, wasin perfect proportion with his body. "Ho ho ho. I'm a fat, happy wood elf,"he said grimly, and slithered out to face the people, Arwen balancing behindhim on heels high enough to suit any Fairy Queen. Snip, snap, snout, went thecameras of the Mordorians, and their money tickled merrily into the foodstalls and souvenir shops of Gondor.   Ariëlle returned to her office. It was brightly lit by force of the greatwindows covering the entire wall overlooking the theme park. It was alsoeerily quiet, due to the sound-proofing properties of the same windows.Ariëlle, undisputed heiress to the magical kingdom of Gondor, satleisurely down at her desk and started looking through all the plans for newmerchandise and better rides. She loved plans; they always seemed to come outin her favour.  "That's a good one," she muttered softly as she examined the suggestion ofelongating Boromir's Ghostride with reappearing hobbit toons as well. "Yes,hobbits are good for many things," she mused, and pushed her Silmarilanbuzzer button. Morrie and Pipsqueak came in at once, Pipsqueak's facebrimming with adolescent love, Morrie still with a calculating look in hiseyes. "Any news of the Halflings?" she asked.  Pipsqueak jumped up and down and squeaked excitedly. Morrie gave him a coldstare. "They're safe, Madame," he informed. "Frodo is filled to the brim withdrugs and ravin' delirious. Sam and Spiegel are... uh... in their room." Hegrimaced. "Kalessin has said his union will contact us about compensation forthe trip. Apparently, Frodo made dying noises the entire time, and the othertwo... well."  "Thank you, my loyal Three-quarts," Ariëlle said pleasantly. "I shall takecare of everything. You have served me well." She followed them out with hergaze, and smiled as she saw Pipsqueak lean on Morrie in a swooning fashion."So susceptible," she thought, absent-mindedly fondling her Silmaril.   In Mordor, the colours of Death and Passion were in power. Volcanic fireleapt from ramshackle house to abandoned car-wreck, black smoke packingitself thicker than ever in the sky. All living things had fled the land forthe pleasures of Gondor and other attractions. The ones that were leftwere the half-living, the scavenging creatures; sneering rats, great, buzzingflies and cockroaches, and spiders.   "Veer iz hee, my darlinks?" The woman veiled in black paused and, strikinga decorative pose against the burning sky, followed her scuttling companionswith her gaze. They were headed towards a mound of shrapnel greater than theothers, a dazzling creation of broken steel reinforcement and glasssplinters, a sculpture protesting the destruction of war made by no man'shand. "Aiii!" wailed Shelob, and ran elegantly towards the wreckage.  One little spider can do nothing, perhaps. But hundreds, or thousands,nourished on flies grown fat on junk food and fighting, can accomplishplenty. Shelob's black warriors spun and fastened, pulled and moved, untilthe mound was opened. Many perished as unstable bits gave way and tumbled,but they were all ready to fulfill the last request of their Liberal Lady."Sztop!" she called out suddenly. "You leaf me nov, all ov you. You hev beenvonderful." She waited for the spiders to disappear, then gingerly made herway up the pile.  All was still.  "Szveethart? Veer ar you?" Shelob murmured softly. She listened. Was that amoan she heard? A moan known to her and loved by her, from happier times thanthese? She walked around the last unbroken wall of Sauron's tower until shefound what she was looking for. It was a door, amazingly whole and stillsealed shut. The Spider Queen reached out her hand to touch it, andsoundlessly, the door swung open. Shelob gave a tentative smile and entered.  "Aglunph," Sauron responded eloquently as his saviour carefully draggedhim out of the room and away from the disintegrating heap. She laid the formerDark Lord out on the ground and kissed his forehead with her sticky lips.Slowly he opened his lidless eyes and looked at Shelob, then let them lingerat the remnants of his tower. "I've always wanted eventful dreams," he said."But don't you think this is a little bit over the top?"  "Shussh, darlink," Shelob hissed lovingly, and stroked his hair. "Your toverwaz razer vell built, vas it not? But zis iz zee ent ov it, I vear."  Sauron winced and sighed. "I guess that is so," he said. "My plan has failed,and I have failed with it. You should have let me rest in my tower, my dear."  Shelob tutted and gently shook his head. Sauron groaned with pain. "But don'tyou szee?" she asked smilingly. "Nov, at last, you are vree." She stared athim and saw his features soften, as gradually many great loads left his wearyshoulders. "I don't feel the incessant need to wogah!" he exclaimed. "And...the Orcs! I don't need to control them, not one little bit. I feel great!" Hetried to sit up, but fell back with a thump. Yet he was still not beaten. "Ifeel like singing!" he said, and drew in his breath deeply. Shelob gently hithis head with a rock, then lifted up her unconscious love and went to searchfor shelter in the wasteland.  "What did she say to you?" asked Sam after the interview with Ariëlle wasover. Spiegel only smiled dreamily and went over to the mirror.  "Do you think my hair looks best free or tied up?" she said as she startedbrushing.  "Your hair looks great no matter how," Sam stated matter-of-factly, andadded, for emphasis, "And that's a fact." He sat meaningfully down on the bed,but Spiegel appeared not to notice.  "So what are you doing tonight, then?" she asked.  "Mm...me?" Sam was flabbergasted. "I thought I was going with you to seethe Parade... together with you," he explained.  Spiegel finished brushing and opened a box of makeup which she startedapplying with great skill. "I'm sorry, Sam," she said. "I'm going to be inthe parade. Ariëlle has offered me work here as a Beauty Queen. Imaginethat - me, a Miss Gondor! Who would have thought?" She decorated her eyesin silence for a while, then turned around to look at Sam. She was just intime to see the door closing softly behind him.  "How are ye, Master Frodo?" Sam asked, unexpectedly feeling a deep longingfor his old, simple life in the Shire. Frodo started, opened his eyes, andgiggled.  "I had such a wonderful dream!" he said. "I was hatching giant butterfliesfrom my stomach. Oh, it's you, Sam," he added as he slowly came somewhat tohis senses.   "Yes," said Sam. "I'm glad that you are here with me," he muttered inaudibly."Here at the end of all things, Master."  "I say, Sam," Frodo exclaimed jofully. "You do look a bit like acaterpillar! But whenever did you decide to colour your hair purple? Youlook most droll!" He smiled contentedly and sunk down on his pillow.
  Gondor had been experiencing a downturn in business of late.  In the weeks since the Rohirrim had left, the gradual flow of cash into the coffers of Ariellë's merchandising empire had shrunk dramatically.  The Rohirrim had parted rather grumpily, some mourning the death of HeyHoDen, others off to help Eowynn prepare her paternity suit, and the remainder simply happy to get back to whatever it was they did with their horses in peacetime (Pipsqueak hoped it was showjumping, but Morrie had told him not to be so naive).  The flood of customers from Mordor had also subsided a little, due mostly to their growing awareness of just how extortionate Ariellë's new pricing policy was, even for a family orientated theme park.  However, the CEO of Gondor Entertainment Inc. still had a trick up her sleeve to drag in the punters.  Along with Acting Deputy Executive Vice Presidents Morrie and Pipsqueak, she had concocted a plan to alter the face of the entertainment industry for years to come.  She had planned a pageant to end all pageants - The Crowning of The New Queen of Gondor!  Through many long nights of deep thought - although Pipsqueak's mind was often elsewhere (I would go into more detail but this is purportedly a family e-text and, well...) - they concocted the plans for the most spectacular spectacle ever spectated.  Two days of non-stop feasting, parades, fireworks and toon-based entertainment were to climax in the Crowning ceremony, of which Ariellë herself would be the star.  However, much work was needed to iron out a few minor problems, such as parking arrangements and the particularly unusual sanitary requirements of the Southrons.  The Crowning was to involve the now much slimmer Aragon, the increasingly reclusive Sam (representing the still-slightly-delirious Frodo as ringbearer) and Spiegel, who was rapidly becoming something of a minor star in her own right and whose first movie was already being planned.  Nobody had been able to find Boromir, but then again, nobody seemed to care.  The festival was a great triumph for manufactured entertainment.People flocked in from hundreds of miles around to eat drink and be merryin the streets of the citadel.  Eric the small cat was a huge success, as were Spiegel and Her Elvish Dancing Girls - a suggestion of Giggly - albeit with a slightly different section of the crowd.  Strangely, though, Sam was nowhere to be seen during Spiegel's act, or for a good while afterwards - the two of them hadn't been talking too much of late.   It was only after a thorough search had been organised that he was found, much to Morrie's relief, wandering aimlessly around the streets and occasionally being pelted with fruit by Orcish children.  Ariellë sat atop a tall throne at the centre of the stage, smiling sweetly, the focus for the attention of thousands of eagerly watching eyes.  To her left stood Aragon, more than an hint of jealousy in his eye,  and a slightly ruffled Sam, hastily rushed through make-up, and to her right Spiegel, the two hobbits having been carefully placed on different sides of the throne to avoid any 'complications'.  A lively, badly dressed MC was leaping around, yelling seemingly random phrases and still managing to evoke a cheer from the audience.  In the wings, between Morrie and Pipsqueak, waited the old and rather befuddled High Priest in Charge of Crowning and the Official Whopping Big Crown of Gondor."So, how are all you happy little people?!" yelled the MC to nobody in particular, and at once became the recipient of a huge, incoherent roar.   "Glad to hear it!!  Well, floks, it's the moment we're all here to see - the once in a lifetime event that is... Ttttthhhhhhheeeeee Ccccccrrrrooooowwwwnniiinnngggg!!!!!!"  Once again, a mighty cheer went up, loud enough to make everyone onstage (including the MC) cringe, but yet seemed to have very little effect on Ariellë who sat smiling away to herself, apparently unaware of the tumult.  The MC bounded away into the wings, and in his place appeared the frail, rather less hip figure of the High Priest.  He had been persuaded, by means unknown to all except Morrie, to shorten the traditionally seven hour ceremony to a single line, and seemed a little too eager to get it all over with.  He was followed by the two Executive hobbits, carrying between them the extravagant, vastly oversized, and really rather gaudy Crown of Gondor, which apparently been made for ancient kings who were more of Aragon's original proportions than Ariellë's.  From somewhere backstage came the blast of a hundred mighty trumpets. "All rise for Queen Ariellë!" shouted Morrie and Pipsqueak in unison, and a deadly silence fell across the onlookers.  Ariellë, however, seemed unmoved by all of this, and sat quietly grinning at nothing in particular.  "People of this city," muttered the priest regretfully to himself, before loudening up a little at a glance from Morrie.  "Friends from distant lands and purchasers of kitsch merchandise, I present to you Ariellë, the New Queen of The Magic Kingdom of Gondor!"  With one disgruntled gesture he snatched the crown from Morrie and placed it on top of her head to great cheers from the crowd.  However, Ariellë herself did not seem very impressed at all with the performance.   She sat in stony silence, her grin now appearing to take on almost manic enthusiasm.  The High Priest looked shocked, and hurried down to Morrie.  "We could have a bit of a problem here," he whispered. "She appearsto be dead."  "Dead?  What do you mean, dead?"  "Dead.  She's kicked the bucket. Gone.  Popped her clogs.  Vamoosh."  "If this is some kind of joke, you'll be tomorrow's FairyBurger meat." Morrie hurried up to the throne, felt Ariellë's neck, and then leantdown and whispered to Pipsqueak, "You know what?  She is dead!"  "Dead?  DEAD!  How can she be dead!  It's so... so sad..."  He fellto the floor, wailing.  A loud murmur swept through the crowd.  Spiegel looked stunned and Aragon uncertain.  Sam, however, seemed impassive, and didn't seem particularly shocked.  "I know, I know.  She was the star attraction.  But there's no need to make all that fuss... we always have Plan B to fall back on."  "Plan B!  You made a Plan B in case Ariellë died?"  "Of curse... my past employment has taught me to prepare for everything. Watch."  Morrie hurried to one side of the stage, gesturing for Aragon and thePriest to follow him.  They went into a huddle briefly, and then emerged,Aragon looking surprisingly pleased and the Priest looking bewildered.Morrie strode to the font of the stage.  "My good friends, we are sorry to disappoint those of you who came to see Queen Ariellë crowned today.  However, we are sad to announce that this will not be possible, due to technical difficulties."  He raised his voice above the sobbing Pipsqueak.  "However, it is my pleasure to announce that in her place, we are all privileged to be able to watch the crowning of our new monarch... so can I have a big hand please for King Aragon!"  The crowd cheered.  They had come to see a crowning, and weren't overly bothered who got crowned.  The High Priest retrieved the Official Whopping Big Crown, and started again with his Ceremony.  "Friends from.."  "STOP!  Stop the ceremony!"  The crowd emitted a collective gasp, for there, emerging onto the stage, was Frodo!  He was tall and skeleton thin, but the crazed look in his eyes was enough to strike fear into the heart of any grown man (or hobbit).  "You must stop the ceremony! Ariellë was murdered!  She was murdered, assassinated by..."  He began to raise his hand, to point as someone on the stage, but his screams were curtailed as an arrow thudded into his back, and he fell to the ground, silenced.
   'I was only ten feet away when the shot rang out.  Whizz.   Thwock.The crowd began to scream, but I'd been on the business end of a darttoo often to be afraid.  I didn't even bother looking into the wings; Ifigured whoever fired the shot was too smart to hang around.  So Istrolled over to Frodo, lying pinned to the stage by the arrow.  Helooked unconscious, and I gave him a tap to help him stay that way.  Iwasn't worried about that skeletal freak; I'd seen him survive too manywounds to think he was in danger.  So I turned him over on his side,broke off the point protruding from his chest, and pulled the rest ofthe arrow out of his back.   'This was a humdinger and no mistake.  I'd just been admiring thefine job pulled on Ariellë: there aren't too many folks who know how tomanufacture a Bywater Grin, and we'll keep it that way, just sayingthat it involves a thumbtack, half a glass of Old Winyards, choklit, agrain of Vala Dust, and the Secret Ingredient.   'But this was different.  I only had to glance at the arrow to knowwhere it came from: long and straight in the shaft, tapering greenfeathers.  Leaving the ceremonial to Paragraph, the Priest, and Aragon,I hoisted Frodo over a shoulder, slipped off the stage, and went tolook for Lego-lass.   '"I wasn't there!" she insisted.  Her square face was shinier thanever.  "Giggly can testify that I was..."   '"Yeah, yeah," I interrupted.  I'd dumped Frodo at the Houses ofHealing, with strict orders to keep him sedated.  "Any gumshoe can tellyou were framed.  The question is, by who?  Who's had access to yourquiver?"   '"Nobody!" she answered.  "I keep it with me at all times.  I onlytake it off when I go to bed."   '"Anybody with you then?" I asked, rhetorically.   '"Nein!" Giggly said.  "I was nowhere around.  You ask Lego-lass!"   '"Yeah," I said, "but the arrow..."   '"What is this?  You want to blame everything on the Dwerrows?  TheDwerrows are responsible for wars, the stock market, assassinations,nu?  You think we have no feelings?  Hath not a Dwarf eyes?  Hath not aDwarf mustaches?  Hath not a Dwarf ear wax, nostril hair, foot fungus?"   '"Waitaminnit.  I didn't say you did it.  I know you couldn't firean arrow without hitting your own foot. I just want to know if you tookLego-lass's arrow."   'Giggly growled and was silent.   '"Things could get rather difficult for 'Lass..." I reminded him.   '"All right!  I did borrow an arrow.  Boromir said he wanted tolook at one, see how it was made."   'Boromir.  How could I have forgotten about him?  The web grewdeeper.   'I found him in the Tower, watching the late-night newscasts ofPalanTirith.  I laid it on the line for him without fear; I'd comearmed with a big bottle of limpë.   '"Thou hast the wrong man, friend!" he exclaimed.  "Ariellë was mysister.  Wherefore should I harm her?"   '"Leave Ariellë out of it, chump.  It was Frodo who got the hit.And you and Frodo have a history, nespasu?"   '"True enough it is that I hate the bastard and would gladly see himdead," Boromir said with a goofy smile.  "But I did not shoot him.Why should I?  As I know from experience, it is not easy to kill sucha one.  And living, he would endure a hell of self-loathing that is farworse than death.  How could I possibly better that?"   '"That's nothing to me.  All I care about is the arrow."   '"I know nothing of arrows.  Why don't you ask Lego-lass?"   '"You're lying," I said.  "Lie again, and you get this bottle oflimpë in the face.  Then you can see if Aragon will make you a newone!"   'Boromir looked at the open bottle poised in his right hand, andgulped.  You could see the lump travel from his throat all the way downto his right foot.  I hate toons.   '"All right, I confess!" he said.  "I asked Giggly to get me anarrow from Lego-lass.  But I didn't mean to kill Frodo!  I swear!"   '"So what did you mean?"   '"She said she'd let me rub oil on her thighs if I got one from her!I didn't know that she would do anything with it!  I thought it wasjust for her weapons collection!  I promise!"   'There are times when a shamus has to decide how far he wants to getinto a case.  Sometimes, when you follow the leads, you end upsomeplace you don't wanna be.  It doesn't matter how long it's taken orhow much work you've done; sometimes you just drop the matter if youknow what's good for you.  As they say where I come from, you can'tfight Brandy Hall.'   So it was that on the day of Midsummer, Aragon the King El Lessermarried Arwen, Warrior Princess, in the City of Commerce, and the longtale of their difficult and tortuous relationship was come tofulfilment.   There are eight thousand stories in the Magic Kingdom.  This hasbeen one of them.
   When the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companionsconsidered, but soon dismissed, the thought of returning to their ownhomes.  'The Shire?' Morrie asked rhetorically as he lay back on hislawn chair sipping a piña colada and having his feet massaged by twobuxom Mûmakteers.  'Where's that?  Oh, yes, I remember.  Depressedarea.  People live in holes.'   Frodo had recovered from his wound, and with plenty of bedrest, newclothes, and five meals a day was better than ever.  But he seemed tohave no memory of the events of Coronation Day at all.   So Frodo went to Aragon as he was sitting with Arwen by thefountain, and she sang a song of Valhalla, while the Tree grew andblossomed.  They welcomed Frodo and rose to greet him; and Aragon said:   'I know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to take up yourownership of Moneybags Hall in Nurnenshire.  Well, dearest friend, thetree grows best in the land of its sires....' (Frodo frowned at this)'but nonetheless you must do as you please.  Behold!  Here are theparchments giving you the title to Nurnenshire; and here are the keysof the manor.  Just sign here... and here.... and again there.Congratulations, Frodo!  You are now the proud owner of Nurnenshire,with a 51% share in Mordor Enterprises, and the courtesy title of "Dukeof Nurn."'   'Fifty... one... percent!' Frodo gasped.  'But that's a controllingshare!'   'Do you wonder at that, Ring-eater?' said Arwen.  'For you know thatthree-quarters of the land area of Mordor is in Nurnenshire, and 99% ofthe arable land.  But do not forget that the headquarters of MordorEnterprises is ruined, its Board of Directors have been slain, and thevast majority of its records are lost with the fall of the Dark Tower.'   'Whoo-hoo!' cried Frodo, heedless of Arwen's cautions.  'I'm incharge of Mordor!  Heh-heh... now those Orcs'll find out how acorporation ought to be run!   Hm... let's see....'   Frodo stalked up and down the courtyard, shouting to himself as hemilked the Kow.  'First, I'll rebuild the Dark Tower.  No, two of them!They must rise even higher then before, or the narcoterrorists havewon!  Then, I'll stamp out the last remnants of Socialism.  In fiveyears we'll be outperforming Gondor!  Hah-hah!  Nothing, nothing canstop me now!  'Cos I--I'm the Duke of Nu-urn!'   'Dook, Dook, Dook   Dook of Nurn, Dook, Dook   Dook of Nurn, Dook, Dook,   Dook of Nurn, Dook, Dook, Dook...' came the echoing chorus from thesides of Mount Minnie.   Aragon coughed.  'Since you are so (potentially) wealthy,' he said,'then you surely won't mind redeeming this.'  And with that heproduced a much-folded, dog-eared document.  'Your IOU,' he went on,'for I believe fifty thousand gold pieces...'   'Fifty grand!'  Frodo exclaimed.  'You kept that?  Youbloodsucker!  You can't be serious!'   'But I am,' Aragon said, nodding.  'You see, with the downturn inrevenue and unredeemed war expenses, Crown finances are somewhatembarrassed. I must collect my debts where they are owed me, or gopenniless.'   'I'm not going to be supporting him,' Arwen finished.   'Well, I don't have 50 Gs on me.  Maybe when I get to MoneybagsHall...'   'Oh, don't worry about that,' Aragon said.  'Just sign this cheque,and it'll be deducted from the assets of your Estate.'   Frodo snarled, but took the proffered quill and signed.  'That's thelast I see of you, you rascal.  I knew as soon as I set eyes upon youthat you were a rogue!  Well, be seein' ya, toots -- I'm off toNurnenshire!'   Aragon took the cheque, verified the signature, and tucked it awayinside the ample folds of his tunic.  He smiled broadly and nodded atArwen.   'One moment, Ring-eater,' she said softly but menacingly.   Frodo stopped and turned back, warned by her voice. 'What is it?' hegrowled, hand straying to the hilt of his sword.   'I understand that after all the trauma you have suffered yourmemory may be weak.  Therefore I wish to bring to your recollectionthis document, which you signed before you left Rivendell.'  Sheproduced an ornate parchment, covered in tiny elvish script and adornedwith many wax seals attached to ribbons.   'Yeah, okay,' said Frodo.  'I remember that.  That's my deferment.But it was good for 10 years, and I destroyed the Ring in much lessthan that amount of time!'   'That is true indeed,' said Arwen.  'Howbeit, I draw your attentionto the last paragraph.  No, the one under the seals.'   Frodo looked.  Besides being half-hidden by the enormous seals, theelvish script was composed of letters about a millimeter and a halfhigh, on average.  He held the parchment close to his eyes, squintedthe right, and read out loud:   'I, Frodo Baggins of Bag End, being of doubtful sanity and unable tocare for myself, do remit to El Rond, Lord of Rivendell, the solecustody and guardianship of any and all Estates that I may lawfullyinherit or otherwise come to possess within the boundaries of the Landof Mordor.  I grant to El Rond, Lord of Rivendell, sole power to actupon my behalf, to buy, sell, grant, deed, enjoy, transmit, bestow,bequeath, or otherwise dispose of said Estates in precisely such manneras if I were a legally declared minor or lunatic.  Signed, FRODOBAGGINS.'   The last words were uttered in a semi-incoherent rush as Frodofoamed extravagantly at the mouth and then collapsed senseless on thecobblestones of the Court of the Fountain.  What a loser, came amocking voice inside his head as he lost consciousness.  I always knewyou wouldn't amount to anything.   The next day, Frodo, Sam, Morrie and Pipsqueak were informed thatthey were several months in arrears on their rents and would forthwithbe expelled from the City.
   When the day of departure came, the four hobbits succeeded inattaching themselves to the tail end of the orda of Rohirrim who hadcome down from the Riddlemark to bear HeyHoDen back to his ancestralkingdom.  King Eonerd and Eowynn verified the dead King's identity inthe morgue, and then shut the zippered black bag as fast as they could.It was a sultry southern summer, and HeyHoDen had been stored up forover three months.   They placed the bag with HeyHoDen's body inside a plastic barrel,which went inside a corrugated metal tube, which was sealed withcement, which was locked inside a packing crate, which was put in thetrailer of a sixteen-wheeler headed north.  The trucker drove slowly,pausing at rest stops every quarter-day to allow the tümän of Ridersto catch up.  The four hobbits hitched a ride in the back of the cab.   In that riding went also Aragon and Arwen and others of the weddingguests: El Rond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, Boromir and Imrahil and, infact,the entire invitation list, all of whom had noticed how muchslimmer their wallets became the longer they stayed in Minas Tirith.   At a leisurely pace they rode the highway north through Anórien, andthey came to injun territory.  The injuni warriors, stoked to afrenzy by the secret herbs they habitually took before entering battle,fired many arrows among them, but hit no one.  Aragon read aloud aproclamation annexing six-sevenths of injun territory to Gondorin return for the right to erect a casino and have exclusive huntingand fishing rights on the remaining one-seventh.  The procession thenrolled on, leaving a few score of anti-hunting and anti-gamblingprotestors demonstrating behind them.   After many days of journey, the truck bearing HeyHoDen came at lastto Edoras City.  The dandelions grew tall and stately about Medusald.There a great feast was held for the visitors; and if the occasionalDunlending slave fell into the immense fires and was accidentallycooked together with the ceremonial horseflesh, no one commented uponit.   Then they buried HeyHoDen, still sealed with cement, fifty feet deepbeneath a mound planted thick with garlic, topped with ancient symbolsof power, and under the permanent guard of the Riddlemark's finestwarriors armed with silver-tipped spears.  With him were buried allthose things and people which he had had close to him in life, lest hereturn to claim them.  The Edoras Choir slowly sang a song of exorcism,which Gléoclubb the minstrel made, and immediately died after.  Eventhose who comprehended not the harsh gutturals of the Edorian tonguecould tell how horrible the song was, as it described the reddenedlight of the moon shining through the blood-drenched fields of theLammas Ichor, the gorecrows slaking their thirst in the red pools, thehowling of the wolves as their brethren crunched upon bones, and howKing HeyHoDen arose and with dripping corpse-fingers sought to destroythose who were close to him in life:   Out of dark, out of death, to the dead's rising   He clambered out of the clay still clinging   To his bloody fingers, with filth blackened   That sought the throats of thrall and servant,   Or of sister-son his throne usurping...   But Morrie wondered at the superstitions of the Riders, ponderinghow they might be turned to his own advantage.   When the burial was over and the stone atop the mound was inscribedwith the words "HeyHoDen, and his worm Grimey", another minstrel (therewere many minstrels and to spare in the Riddlemark of those days, andtheir lives were held cheap) named all the Lords of the Mark in theirordure: Yorl the Kid, who had purchased Edoras in the days ofGondor's indebtedness, and Prego mixer of the Sauce, and Polderdrainer of the Fens, brother of Molder the Dead; and Freewine theGenerous, and Goldwyn the Mogul, and Dior the Couturier, and Gram theWeighty, and Helm the Hard-headed, and Deem the Jazzmaster, who hadheld concerts in Deem's Help that had rivalled those of Caer Andrews.So ended the nine mounds on the west, because there had been a violentrevolution in those days which installed a new dynasty, and after camethe mounds of the east-side: Freelove the Revolutionary; and Fluffy,who due to lack of ceremonial propriety (the minstrels had been unableto keep a straight face when speaking his name) had returned as adraugr and had eaten half the warriors in Medusald before beingexorcised; and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and Fengel, and Thengel,and HeyHoDen the latest.  And by the time HeyHoDen was named, Eonerdand all the Riders were very drunk.   When the feast drew to an end (at about four in the morning, withthe sun due to rise soon), Eonerd tried to arise and said in a slurredvoice: 'HeyHoDen's dead.  That means I'm the king.  Cool, huh?'   A nervous titter arose from those of the guests who were not alreadyasleep or dead drunk.   'But I got good news for ya,' he continued.  'Eewww....inifred mysis had the hots for Aragon.  But he's already married, the bastard.And 'sides he's her father.  Life sucks, dunnit?'   More nervous laughter.   'So instead she's gonna marry the nummer two guy.  Wossis name.Farrie... Farrah... uh... Bore-oh-meer, Steuart of Gonnor©!'   Muted cheers.  Eonerd propped himself up, knuckles on the table, andlooked around to see if anyone would respond.  Aragon came awake with astart after a swift kick from Arwen, and removed a paper from his tux.   'Thus,' he read slowly and with a wince, 'is the friendship of theMark and of Gondor bound with a new bond.  No niggard are you,Eonerd, to give...'   'What?' Eonerd interrupted.  'Whadjou say?'   Aragon coughed and began again.  'No niggard are you, Eonerd...'   'Thass what I thought you said.  Well I don'know whuss like inGonnor.  But here in Ed'ras we don' allow filthy lang-idge like that inthe hall!'   'All I said,' said Aragon, 'was "No niggard..."'   'Thass enough!  Outta the hall, now!  We'll settle this innacourtchard!'  Eonerd reached with one hand for his sword-belt, lost hisbalance, and fell face forward onto the table.  Aragon and Arwen leftswiftly, and departed without taking leave of King Eonerd.   The hobbits had remained hidden during this time, but before theprocession was ready to roll Morrie paid a last visit to Eonerd andEowynn.  And Eonerd said, 'Kings of old would have laden you with giftsthat a tractor-trailer could not bear for your deeds upon the Cowboy'sField; but those were the Kings of Old, and these are cheaper times.Nonetheless, my sister wants you to have this, in memory of the hornsof the Mark at sunrise.'  And Morrie wondered what Eonerd was talkingabout, but he kept his mouth shut.   Then Eowynn gave to Morrie a small tin horn, wrought with a rubbersphere at one end.  'This is an heirloom of our house,' said Eowynn.'When you squeeze the globe, the horn will make a noise.  Behold!' andshe pressed the rubber sphere with her white fingers.  Honk went thehorn.  Honk, honk.
   Lego-lass and Giggly were to continue on to the Giggling Caves atDeem's Help, to start their long-planned amusement park.  Aragon andArwen, who had an interest in all new enterprises in the region, camealong, as did El Rond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, as they were planning toreturn to their homes by this route.    When Lego-lass emerged from theGiggling Caves she was laughing her rear end off, and immediatelyfronted Giggly the money to begin the project, and the two at oncetelegraphed Minas Tirith to round up investors.   Leaving Lego-lass and Giggly behind, the others rode from Deem'sHelp to Isengard, expecting to meet the Ments there and behold Isengardtransformed into an electric paradise.  But all the land around was dimand quiet as they approached.  Eagles circled ominously overhead.Cardinals and waxwings in the nearby bushes eyed them disturbingly.   At Isengard they saw that the stone circle had been destroyed.Where it had been was a wilderness of trees and bushes, full of deer,bears, wolves, panthers, oliphaunts, sloths, tigers, langurs andmacaques, not to mention birds of all shapes and sizes.  Withtrepidation the travellers rode to the center of the old circle.  Thehobbits, as usual, sneaked along behind.  The hideous shape of Eyesorestill stood there, its shadow sadly reflected in the water of a poolsurrounding it.   As they stood, aghast at the transformation of Isengard fromsomething that might have been economically productive into some kindof biologically diverse eco-park, they heard a series of squawks andwhistles coming from nearby.  They turned, and slowly became aware of afigure sitting very still, cross-legged, in the shade of a pine tree.   It was clad in a simple robe of hempen brown, and its thin hair andscanty beard were of brown streaked with grey.  A yellow-breasted chatstood on one thigh and ate berries from an upturned hand.  The mansmiled, looking well-pleased and amused.   A sudden light broke on Frodo.  'Radagast!' he cried, forgettingthat he was supposed to be sneaking.   Radagast laughed.  'So you have heard the name, have you?  All theWoodmen used to call me that in Rhosgobel, I believe.  A sign ofaffection, possibly.  But evidently you did not expect to see me here.'   'I did not,' Frodo said.  'But I might have guessed.  The crows, theeagles...'   'Exactly,' Radagast answered.  'You have been watched, all the wayfrom Rivendell.  And now, with Aruman and Gandalf out of the way, withMorenaughtie and Rumpustum in the distant East, with the Balrogdestroyed and Sauron reduced to impotence, I am the most powerful ofthe Maiar left in the West.  And I have... hm... plans.'   'You traitor!' cried Aragon.  'What have you done with my Ments?'   'I sent them home,' Radagast said happily.  'To rust, I hope.  Theirwork is done.  Trees and orchards are coming back here, King of Gondor,where birds may sit and sing and beasts may dig their holes.  In time,Rohan and Gondor both may become fit habitations for the animals thatshall inherit them.  Even in Lothlórien, perhaps, the golf coursesshall grow over with crabgrass, to become the abode of moles andchipmunks!'   Aragorn gritted his teeth.  'You can't do this,' he said slowly.'You're eating into my profit margin.  How many people do you think aregoing to come out to see this...' -- he gestured around him -- 'thiswilderness?'   'Middle-earth was a wilderness once, before Men got their hands onit,' Radagast said.  'One day it shall be a wilderness again.  What yousee is merely the first-fruits.  Go back to your kingdom, King ofGondor; keep it as you may.  But know that the beasts and birds arereturning.  They will reclaim their own.'  He resumed his silentsitting, and the chat began to whistle again.   Aragon turned on the hobbits, whom he now saw for the first time.'This is your doing, isn't it!  You fiends!  You have come all this wayjust to see me, the King of Gondor, humiliated!'   Frodo shook his head, confused.  A voice inside his head seemed tobe saying squeeze him while you can, precious!, but he did notunderstand it.  Sam grinned.  Pipsqueak stared at the spaces betweenhis toes while Morrie whistled nonchalantly.   Arwen came up behind Aragon.  'This is not the hobbits' doing,' shesaid softly.  'They knew no more of Radagast than we, nor do his plansfit with theirs.  Yet I wonder what brings them so far, following onour very heels?'   Frodo looked at Sam, helplessly.  Sam looked at Paragraph.Pipsqueak nudged Morrie, who looked back at Arwen defiantly.   'I was hoping to get a word with you privately,' he said.  'Butthis'll have to do.'   'A word?' said Arwen.  'About what?'  Her voice was soft butmenacing, as it not infrequently was.   'About your part in the murder of Ariellë Húriniel, and theattempted murder of Frodo Baggins.'   Aragon, Sam and Pipsqueak gasped.  The Elves chuckled sarcastically.   'Murder, Mr. Brandybuck?  That's a hard charge to make against theQueen of Gondor.  What evidence do you have?'   'Enough.  I know that you enticed Boromir into convincing Gigglyinto stealing an arrow from Lego-lass's quiver, which you then coulduse to shoot Frodo to keep him quiet, while putting the blame onLego-lass.'   'Hah!' Arwen laughed.  'You are very clever, Mr. Brandybuck.  Tooclever, some might say.  Yes, you are right, Mr. Brandybuck.  I didshoot Frodo, not to kill him, but to keep him from blurting out thename of Ariellë's murderer before the people of the City.'   'Your name.'   'No, not my name, Mr. Brandybuck.  The name of the killer.  The oneperson who had the most to gain from the murder.  But no court can nowprosecute the murderer; for he now is the law, and the ultimatejudge: Aragon son of Arathon, King El Lesser.'   Everyone turned to look at Aragon.  He stared back at them, mouthgaping wide open.   'No,' he gasped after a long silence.  'Not me!  Ididn't do it!  I didn't really want to be king, not like that!'   Morrie looked in Aragon's face for a long time.  Then he shook hishead and turned back to Arwen.  'Nope, lady,' he said, 'you've got thewrong guy.   It takes a smart cookie to cook up a Bywater Grin, andfrankly, your husband's just a few holes short of a smial, if you knowwhat I mean.'   'But it had to have been!  I mean, who else...'   'Who indeed,' said Morrie, looking around him meaningfully.  'Whoindeed.'   Idiot, said the voice in Frodo's head.   Radagast had arisen during the conversation and stood just outsidethe circle of recrimination, leaning on a smoothed pinewood staff.  Hechuckled softly.  'Well, King of Gondor,' he said, 'perhaps you oughtto return to your own land now. If your own Queen thinks you guilty ofmurdering your predecessor, there may be others with the same thought.And while there is no legal way to punish a king, there are manyillegal ways to remove one. There are those who would not be unhappywith a change.  Some, I guess, who are unhappy with the recent peacewith Mordor, perhaps?'   Aragon and Arwen looked at each other in terror, rushed to theirhorses, and galloped off southward without a word of farewell.   'Well now,' said Radagast, considering the elves and hobbits beforehim.  'You were travelling on to Rivendell, were you not?  Excellent.I think I shall go with you. It will give me an opportunity to stretchmy legs, and give more attention to the northlands, where my effortsare perhaps especially needed.'   'But... but... ' said Pipsqueak.   'What about the weed trade?' exclaimed Morrie.   'What about the Revolution?' expostulated Sam.   'Cassiopeia!' screamed Frodo, apropos of nothing.   'We're not gonna take this,' said Morrie.   'Oh, no, we ain't gonna take it,' rumbled Sam.   At that moment an immense black bear, six feet tall at the shoulder,ambled out from behind a rhododendron and looked at them.  Its six-inchclaws clacked upon the rocks, and its tongue licked brutally longcanines.   'Rest assured, my young friends,' said Radagast, stroking the bear'sfur, 'that all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner ofthing shall be well.'  And they believed him.  He was a Maia, afterall.
   They travelled westward, the Elves riding on their horses, thehobbits on various species of wild deer that Radagast had summoned(Frodo rode an especially majestic elk with an antler-span of tenfeet).  Radagast himself rode bear-back.   They passed by the Gap in Rohan.  Radagast had a word with themanager, and within a week they were selling clothing made from hemp,organically-grown cotton, and recycled fibres, while a detachment ofwell-drilled mandrills provided security.   They rode through the Gap into the slums of Dunland.  There theyfound endless chain-link fences, hills of burning tires, vast pavementsof cracked asphalt, collapsing brick tenements, and shantytowns roofedin corrugated iron.  The Dunlendings who loitered on the street-cornersmocked them, calling them fairies--; but Radagast had only togesture, and waves of green kudzu covered the trash-heaps andtenements, and the Dunlendings fled, racked by allergies.   Six days after leaving Isengard they journeyed through theliquor-retailing zone of Dunland.  At 6, as the lights began to comeon, they overtook a lady with a superfluity of legs, dashingly clad inred and black.  At her heels slouched a semi-naked man in blackleather, leashed to her by a spiked dog-collar and gazing morosely atthe ground.   'Well Shelob!' said Radagast.  'Where are you going?'   'Vhot isz zet beink to you?' she answered.  'Vosz you lookink for avogah, or voot you rezser hef a date visz Sztinky?'   'You know the answers,' Radagast said.  'No and no.  But in any caseyour monopoly on wogah is over.  The King controls the red-lightdistrict in Disgiliath now.  But if you had waited in Mordor, you wouldhave seen him, and he might have shown more interest in your offer.'   'Zen all ze more reason to hef left sooner,'  said Shelob, 'for I amnot desirink him.  Indeed, if you are vishink for en enswer to yourfirst qvestion, I vosz lookink for a ravine in ze mountainsz in vhichto be spinnink my veps.'   'Then you are going the wrong way.  I know a forest where you mightfeel right at home, though.  Would you like my help?'   'You helpink me?' said Shelob.  'Surely you isz jestink me.  Isink zosz vilt-lants isz not beink so goot for ze nightclups, yes?  Youhaf gecome to be laughink at Shelop in her vonderinks, visz no clup, nostaich, no Grisettes...' and she began to weep copious tears.   'There, there,' said Radagast, patting her kindly on the shoulder.   'Who is this wench?' said Paragraph.   'And why haven't we been introduced yet?' said Moribund.   'It's Shelob, the decadent and depraved whoremistress ofDisgiliath!' ranted Sam.   'Oh, indeed,' said Morrie.  'Perhaps you should have told us moreabout your, er, adventures there.  What's she do?'   'Vhot dosz Shelop doink?' hissed the madam.  'How isz my famegefallen!  Alas, zet I kennot show you vhot I coot be doink in ze dayszof my glory!'  And she wept again.  Then, suddenly tearless, sheclapped her forelegs.  'Sztinky!' she ordered.  'Be showink zeesz finegentlesz vhot it is ve isz doink.  I em trop fatigué to indulchmyself.'  She flicked him the man behind her with a whip she held inher front claw.  He shuddered, but did not move or turn his face fromthe ground.   'Poor Sztinky!' Shelob whispered confidentially to the travellers.'Hisz tower isz gefallen down, end now he kennot to erect it again.Get up!' she shouted at the slouching man, yanking on his leash.  'Dozet number from South Tampalas.'   The man staggered up and faced his audience.  There were darkcircles beneath his reddened eyes, white streaks of dry salt on hisface, and a brown encrustation at one corner of his mouth.  Hiscodpiece was decorated with the Lidless Eye.  He began to sing, morethan passably, but without emotion:   Bloodthirsty Shelob is the      lob I love   Bloodthirsty Shelob is the      lob I love   Bloodthirsty Shelob is the      lob I love   Now ain't that too damn bad!   Her kiss is like trinitro-      toluene   Her kiss is like trinitro-      toluene   Her kiss is like trinitro-      toluene   Now ain't that too damn bad!   Bloodthirsty Shelob's suckin'      Uruk blood   She is always suckin'      Uruk blood   Bloodthirsty Shelob's suckin'      Uruk blood   An' she don't use Aqua-fresh!   Shelob laughed, clapped and blew kisses at the audience.  They didnot applaud.  The sight of Shelob's slave, wretched and degraded beyondimagination, stirred even Morrie with, if not pity, then at least anutter revulsion that afforded no amusement.   Shelob's face turned sour.  'Be goink!' she said.  'You hef doomtyourselfs, end you isz knowink it.  It vill be comfortink me in myvonderinks to sink zet you hef geburnt down your own house vhen you hefdestroyt Sztinky'sz.'   Shelob yanked on her slave's leash, and he crouched down on allfours.  She turned back the way they had come, and he followed.  But ashe passed them, he whimpered 'Poor old Stinky!  Poor old Stinky!Always beaten, never a wogah.  How I hate her!  How I wish I couldleave her!'   'Then leave her!' said Radagast.   But "Stinky" only glanced with one red eye full of terror atRadagast, and then shuffled quickly past behind Shelob.  At length thepair came to the hobbits, and Shelob stopped and stared at them; butthey looked at her with indifference.   'So you isz gloatink over Shelob too, my ducks?' she said.  'Noteven a little kiss for her?' and she turned a heavily rouged cheektoward them.  No one stepped forward.  Shelob sighed.  'I hef only vonvord of advice for you, chickies.  Bevare ze Roglinks!  Zet isz all.Au revoir, mes petits amis.  Au revoir!'  and she and Stinkyvanished down the path.   Lovely limbs, eh, sonny boy? said the voice in Frodo's mind.Frodo slumped over and had the dry heaves.
   The next day they rode through suburban Dunland, where no men nowdwelt, though it was a green and pleasant neighborhood, due toskyrocketing property taxes.  Radagast now rode some way ahead,murmuring to himself, scattered phrases in which the word 'Rogling'could often be heard.   'What's a Rogling, and why did Shelob warn us against them?'Pipsqueak asked Frodo after a while.   'I don't know,' Frodo answered.  'I have trouble thinking thesedays.  Tell me, Pip, did you ever... I don't know... think you heard,well, someone talking, like a voice, only there was no one there?'   'Oh, yes, quite a lot,' Pipsqueak responded brightly.  He was havinga good day.   'And, um... did this voice ever, well, criticize you or tell youwhat to do?'   'Oh, all the time.'   'And... did your voice have a name?'   'Sure!  It was Aruman, chief of the wizards.  He came back from thedead to warn me against Gandalf.'   'Do you still hear him?'   'Nah.  He went away after Gandalf died.  I guess he was finishedwith me.'   'Well, Pip... you're not going to believe this... but I'm hearing avoice, too.'   'No!'  Pipsqueak was visibly and sincerely flabbergasted with utteramazement.  Even on a good day, he had his limits.   'I think it's trying to tell me something... but I don't know what.And I think... I think I know who it is, but I daren't believe it...'   'Who?' asked Pipsqueak excitedly.   'Bilbo.  It sounds like Bilbo.  But it can't be, can it?  Bilbo'snot dead.'   'I dunno.  Why don't you ask El Rond?'   So Frodo rode ahead after El Rond's party, who in typical elvishfashion had ridden along with the hobbits while having absolutelynothing to do with them.  It took Frodo quite some time to get El Rondto notice him.  Had he still been only three feet tall, he never wouldhave managed it; but he finally succeeded in physically squeezingbetween El Rond and Al Ladan, with whom El Rond was conversing.   'I hate mortals,' El Rond was saying.  'I can't stand them anylonger. It's the smell. I feel saturated by it. I can taste theirstink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been... infectedby it.  I must get out of here.  I must get free.   Oh, it's you,Mister Baggins.'   'El Rond,' Frodo said, 'do you know what happened to my fa... toBilbo?  He's safe at Rivendell, isn't he?'   El Rond made a dismissive shrug.  'And this concerns me how...Mister Baggins?'   'Well, I'm afraid... I think something terrible may have happened tohim, Sir.'   El Rond sighed and looked angry.  'What happens to Mr. Bilbo Bagginsis none of my concern.  I am in no way... responsible for his welfare.'   'But... was he safe, was he all right the last you saw him.'   El Rond rolled his eyes backward in their sockets.  'Yes,' he saidat last.  'He was thinking of you, if you must know.'  Frodo breathed asigh of relief.  'Actually I think he left you a note, though none ofus could read it.  Do we have it, Al Rokar?'  Al Rokar produced anenvelope from his saddle-bags and handed it to El Rond, who passed itto Frodo, taking good care to avoid touching his fingers.   Frodo fell back and opened the envelope.  It was indeed in Bilbo'sinimitably illegible script, and it took him several minutes before hecould puzzle part of it out; but intercepting Bilbo's letters to his"nieces" and reading them had been one of his favorite childhoodamusements.   "El Rond you bas...d", it read, "Why didn't you include me in theCompany?  I'm going whether you like it or not.  Frodo can't be trustedwith the Ring.  He'll spoil Gandalf's plan for sure.  So what ifthey're days ahead.  I'll just follow A...n's cute ..s.  I'll get thatRing back, sure as my name's Don Gi..anni!  BB."   Frodo felt ill, but that was nothing new.  Then all of a sudden thevoice came back into his mind, louder and clearer than ever before.How dare you read my mail, boy! followed by It's ours, precious,and we wants it!  Frodo suddenly found that, without noticing it, hehad folded the letter and put in inside his waistcoat-pocket.   At last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly to thebrink of the deep valley of Rivendell, and saw emanating from the clefta red light shining, lighting the whole valley like a dark flame.   Radagast caught his breath.  At the descent into the valley therehad stood for many years a tall birch tree.  But though it was onlySeptember, it seemed to stand leafless, and yet glowed with a ruddylight.  As they drew nearer to the tree, they saw that from the end ofevery twig there seemed to leap a tiny flickering flame, barely an inchtall; and within each flame moved an almost microscopic black creature.   Radagast reached up into the branches, and scooped one off onto hispalm.  It burned there for a few moments, then crawled to the tip ofhis outstretched index finger, spread minute diaphanous wings like amayfly's, and flew back into the tree.   'It is as I feared,' said Radagast.  'The 'Rogs have hatched west ofthe mountains.'   'I remember who murdered Ariellë,' Frodo mumbled in return.
  Not wanting to deal with Roglings, the hobbits and Radagast spent ratherlittle time in Rivendell before going on.  Even Margarita could not getthem to enjoy their stay; El Rond was about to vote the conscription andall those present would have to go on a Rogling hunt, which is ratherunpleasant when you are not trained in the art, as you all know.  Theywere all rather sad that they could not get their hands on Bilbo, though;after all he was responsible for all the misery they had gone through. He decided to get rid of the Ring and give it to Frodo.  The Hobbits were not to eager to see the Shire again, except forMorrie.  Frodo was thinking of all his creditors that he had thought he'dnever see again. Sam was trying to find a plausible explanation to giveRosie; he had been gone for over a year just about when he was going tolead the revolution. Morrie was actually thinking of how he couldtighten his hold over the underground and expand his markets - he hadmanaged to get a weak king on the throne, after all.  And Pipsqueak, well,he didn't have a character that was too developed around the beginning ofthe e-text, so he was just worried that he'd lose all the depth he hadacquired.  As they walked, Radagast turned to Frodo and asked him if hewas unwell. He was, after all, supposed to feel his old wounds aroundthis time of the strory.    "Not really," replied Frodo. "I know that I am wounded with knife, stingand tooth, and claws, and falls, and disillusionment, but it's not that bad.Everything will heal I expect."  "How about when you said you remembered who killed Ariellë?" askedRadagast.  "Oh, yes, it's fairly obvious who ordered the kill and I'm suprised thatnone of the other Hobbits realised it."  "How do you mean?"  "Just look at the way in which Ariellë was killed," replied Frodo.  "TheBywater Grin was done perfectly, and the Beltbuckleland Crime Syndicatehas never revealed the trick to anyone.  So it logically falls that thecrime was perpetrated by a Hobbit.  To my certain knowledge, there wereonly four Hobbits present.  Out of those four, only one could know howto do the Grin."  "Why didn't you tell anyone before?"  "The voices told me not to.  They told me that it would cause mayhem. Since the voices are also the ones who explained to me what I justexplained to you, I believed them."  "So why are you telling me now?  I don't understand you."  "The voices told me that once we had passed the Forsaken Inn and werefinally nearing Bree, noone would care anymore, and I could tell ifanyone asked."  "I see," said Radagast, and after a paused added, "I'll have to ponderwhat you have told me."  As they neared Bree, they came to a halt.  They wanted to get news ofwhat had happened since they left, but they didn't want to go into town,remembering the huge bill that the Nazdaq had raised for them atBarliman Butterball's inn.  It was finally elected that Frodo, now beingbeyond recognition, would go accompanied by Radagast, whom noone knewaround these parts.  Why they trusted him, they couldn't've told, butthey did, probably because he hadn't tried to ask them for a fee foranything yet.  As they entered the town, Frodo knew that something had gone horriblywrong.  All the aluminum sidings had been replaced by compositematerials, and there had been no guard at the gate. Insted, an ATM stoodthere, an Automated Talking Machine, which told them that they had topay ten flokarinos each in order to have access to the town.  They thenproceeded to the Prancing Pony, expectng to gather news in the commonroom, which to their utter amazement was empty.  They asked Barlimanabout this.  "'Tis because of the new college which has opened in the Shire.  'Tisa bunch of Big'Uns that came from the South, they started by buying outmost of the industries in the area, including our siding industry,which they have defiled.  Then they somehow managed to overthrown allstock markets and have all our banks go bankrupt.  They then opened up acollege in the Shire and started new banks, so that they would get allthe profits.  'Tis an evil day to be in these parts."  Hearing this Frodo had a secret smile, being very happy indeed; thismeant that his credit history has most likely been erased entirely!  Buthidding his enthusiasm, Frodo asked for a room for two for the night,and for a good pouch of Eastfarthing weed.  "Ah, but had you asked for anything else, good masters," saidButterball.  "We are now stuck with our own since there in none to behad from the Shire.  All we have is Easthanging, which cannot becompared to Eastfarthings."  Then then talked a bit of what had happenedin the south, being careful not to reveal their true identities, Frodo,in a flash of genius had decided to go as Mr Overhill.  They talkedabout the return of the king, and that he would most likely come thisway eventually.  Reassured Butterball that he would not raze his innfor past offenses, and that he would most likely elect residence wherethe halls of the king has been in the north, a place called Fu****gNorth.  Legend has it that the place got his name when a king, which oneis now forgotten, was stuck inside his castle because of a snow stormand expressed himself with the epitath which is now the name of theplace.  With that, they all went to bed.  The next morning, Radagast and Frodo took their leave of this ghastlyplace and went to rejoin their companions, since they can't really becalled friends, and told them all that they had learned.  Sam was aboutto ask a question about the revolution, when he was cut off by Morrie:  "So my industry is faltering, but I have new markets that I haveguaranteed myself, what with this slow witted king.  I could even makeup a spece for you if you're interested, Frodo, on the condition that youforget what those voices of yours told you.  I would eventually win incourt, but it would be rather bothersome, and it's not quite true.  I'dhave to let the truth be known if you did try to frame me."  So they kept on walking in silence towards the Shire.  When they passedby the forest in which Tom Bombadil resides, they tried to hurry past it,but Radagast stopped them.  He said that this is where he would leavethem.  He was worried about those voices Frodo was hearing, so he wantedto have a good talk with Bombadil, a talk like he hadn't had in many ayears.  He also wanted to know if Bombadil still had his copy of the DSMIV lying around somewhere; he had lost his since their psychiatryclasses.  So they trudged along, each lost in their own thoughts once again: Frodo quite happy that his debt seemed to be cleared, Morrie wonderinghow he could regain and expand his underground empire (remember thatHobbits live in holes...), and Sam angry that since the author couldn'timitate his dialect elected not to have him talk for the whole chapter. Let's not forget Pipsqueak, he realised that he was losing all the depthof character he had acquired during their adventures.
     Not more than a mile had passed when Pipsqueak, still musing overthe dull future which awaited him, wrinkled his nose.     "What's up, Pipsqueak?" laughed Frodo. "Trying a new facial expression? Think that'll help?" And he and Morrie laughed, though Sam just looked at Frodo's bare throat menacingly and did not join in.     "No," Pipsqueak replied, "I smell smoke."     And sure enough, as the wind slowly changed they all noticed it: a faint whiff of burning, coming from somewhere within the Old Forest. Apart from a slight darkening of the sky to their right, however, they could see nothing amiss; though Pipsqueak thought he could see, for the briefest moment, a small glowing creature like a flying coal flitting dangerously behind the first layer of trees.     Darkness was descending as the four hobbits, nearing the old Bucklebelt Bridge, began to notice the red glow from the depths of the Forest and hear the crackle and roaring. The smoke was now growing acrid in their nostrils. "Still forest, and it comes right up to both sides of the road," Morrie observed grimly. "And we've still got two miles to go!"     "Burn baby burn," Sam muttered under his breath.     "If we hurry," Pipsqueak gasped, "we could try leaving the path and making directly for the River. We might get there ahead of the flames, and jump in."     "No! I'm not gonna ruin my new shoes!" Frodo hollered.     "No chance," Morrie observed, ignoring Frodo as usual. "Wind's freshening. Flames are moving faster. We'd better just run like hell and hope the flames don't burn the whole Shire to the ground."     With that Morrie threw his pack to the ground and began running, and Frodo and Pipsqueak did likewise. Only Sam, long used to carrying the heavy burdens of his employers, kept his provisions with him as he ran.     The flames were soon visible. Fire began encroaching upon the Road as they ran, choking and scared, toward the Bridge. They managed to stay ahead of the blaze in spite of the wind, but as they rounded the final bend Morrie swore in amazement.     "A gate!" he yelled. "They've put up an Erudamned gate!"     And no ordinary gate blocked their way. Made of plate iron and solid steel, it stretched across the Road and was anchored to two great walls of brick which blocked all access to the River in both directions. Fully twelve feet high it loomed, and was surmounted by a series of nasty eight-inch spikes and a thick generous topping of razor wire. Morrie quickly checked the impregnable lock, then he threw the huge doormat (inexplicably marked Keep The Shire Clean!) aside to dig his way under the door, only to find that the roadway under the gate had been resurfaced with huge slabs of freshly-quarried granite. "What the hell is this?" he shouted at the world in general.     "Hey! Hey! Open the gate!" Pipsqueak shouted, banging his fists on the metal.     The wind carried a huge blast of heat towards the hobbits, and an ancient oak crashed across the roadway some fifteen feet behind them, all its branches raging with flame. The travellers sputtered in the sparks and heat, and watched in horror as the dry grass ignited on both sides of the road. Above the hiss and crackling a voice could be heard through the gate. "Shire's closed," the voice said easily. "Visiting hours are between eight and five. Try us again tomorrow."     Morrie and Frodo joined Pipsqueak at the door, pounding their fists on the metal. "Let us in! Let us in!" they shouted. "There's fire out here! We'll burn!"     "The Chief said that sort o' thing was likely t' happen," the voice replied easily.     "Open the gate or we'll die!" Pipsqueak yelled.     The flames approached closer. The iron plating of the door began to heat. For a moment the sweltering hobbits heard no reply save the blaze. Finally the voice answered. "Should've thought o' that beforehand," it said, almost nonchalantly. "Now mind you, in the Shire things is different. We've made preparations. Set matters to hand beforehand, you might say. And if you die, well, that's tragic, I suppose, but if you'd prepared yourselves a bit like we did you might not be in such a fix now. Maybe next time 'round you'll be luckier. Have a nice day."     The hobbits looked at each other in breathless panic, then redoubled their pounding on the iron gate. Pipsqueak's fists were starting to get burned by the heating metal. "Let us in! Let us in!" they cried, choking and sweating in the heat.     "Nope," the voice finished. "No visitors at night. Go away."     "But we aren't visitors," Frodo gasped. "We live here!"     "You what?" the voice said suddenly. "You live here? Did ye sign out? D'ye have a travel pass?"     In the thickening smoke Sam drew upon some hidden reserve, and a memory of the voice. "Look here, Hobbie Haywain," he shouted. "If you don't let us in right this minute ye'll find my fist'll be giving ye some o' that dental work ye so desperately need!"     "Bless me!" the voice replied, and from deep within the gate there came a long series of metallic thung noises. Half of the great gate began to creak, and the four hobbits threw their weight against the now-searing metal. They cried and gasped with effort but the door refused to move until they noticed the gate opened outwards and tried pulling on it instead.     "Get in here! Get in here!" Hobbie yelled, and as the four hobbits stumbled through the opening he grasped the door with his great oven-mitts (garishly embroidered Property Of The Shire), swung it shut, and relatched the twenty-three mighty latches. As he set the last latch he turned around, and was astonished to find the four hobbits had already begun to run towards Hobbiton. "Hey, there, wait!" he shouted. "Ho! Wait! Ye're breakin' Rule Twelve!"     After a short distance the hobbits ran behind a short brick building and stopped, gasping.     "What the hell was old Hobbie on about?" Sam choked, wiping the soot from his eyes.     "Who knows," Morrie coughed, spitting some ash out of his throat. "He's never exactly been the smartest bread in the sandwich."     "Well, at least he stopped chasing us," Pipsqueak wheezed. "Good thing. The concrete was really beginning to hurt my feet."     With a sudden horrible realization the four hobbits stopped and looked at the ground. The area surrounding the small building was paved with concrete. They looked out towards the road into town and saw lines of neat, ordered cobblestones. "Where's all the peat moss?" Frodo said in astonishment. "What happened to the bark paths? The mud-and-dirt roads? The fast-food wrappers?"     "This is unnatural," Sam had to agree.     Night had begun, yet the red glow of the burning Forest could be seen clearly over the Wall. By that glow the hobbits could see their sometimes-beloved, sometimes-despised Shire had changed. Ugly buildings of stone and mortar stood in rows where they remembered seeing ugly buildings of mud and thatch before. Wastebaskets and the occasional spitoon stood in ordered pairs beside the paving of the roadways. Their sticky dirty little Shire had become a place of harsh right angles. "Something horrible is happening here," Frodo whispered. "This place is all sculleyed and muldered. It's making my head hurt."     "Mine too," agreed Morrie. "But right now we need to get under cover. We'll wait till tomorrow to wreak unholy revenge."     They snuck towards an ugly new brick building with a very un-Shire-like slate roof, jimmied the door and slunk within. Inside they found only some wrought-iron patio furniture and a huge store of canned foods. They selected some cans of corned beef and Eastfarthing Canned Broccoli, but realizing they had no can openers they were forced to hack at the cans with their swords. Then Pipsqueak noticed there was no cook-pot, no firewood and indeed no hearth. After six unsuccessful attempts to set fire to Frodo the hobbits sat down in the dark, and cheerlessly ate cold corned beef before lying down for an uncomfortable sleep.     At dawn they were awakened by a furious pounding at the door. "Open up, in the name of the Chief!" came the cry from outside. "You're all under arrest!"     "No!" Frodo screamed back angrily. "I'm under a duvet!"     Morrie rose swiftly and kicked open the door, confronting the six Shrrrfffs standing outside with brandished steel. "Arrest, huh?" he sneered angrily. "On what charge?"     "On these charges," the lead Shrrrfff answered, bravely backing up a step. "On charges of Gate-breaking, and Not Signing Out, and Muddying the Roadways, and Breaking and Entering, and Stealing Food, and Carrying Unregistered Swords, and Attempting To Start A Fire, and Improper Handling of Canned Foods."     "And what else?"     "That'll do for a start."     "I can think of a few others," Moribund Brandybuck said coldly. "Like Running a Drug Cartel, or Conspiracy and Racketeering, or maybe Murdering Five Shrrrfffs In Cold Blood And Then Taking The Sixth Hostage."     "You've done all that?" the lead Shrrrfff garbled.     "I certainly plan to," replied Morrie, and pulling a deadly rapier he had stolen from Rohan he set upon the Shrrrfffs. Of the five that died only two of them found time to scream.     "Here, now, Robin Wheelburrow!" Sam said, looking at the bound and gagged Shrrrfff. "You'd better tell us what the hell has been happening around here! And be quick about it, because these exposition scenes are always way too slow."     "Mmmmmmph mmmpppmph mmh mmppppphh!" the young hobbit replied.     Morrie cut the gag from his mouth with a dagger. "No yelling," he growled. "I don't have time to make a proper Bywater Grin, but I can always give you the old traditional Grin by carving a smile across your throat."     "yes, sir," Robin whispered inaudibly.     "Now what happened?" Sam snapped. "We heard tell of some kind of Collage, or somethin' just as foul, like Decoupage maybe."     "That's College, not Collage," Robin replied, putting the emphasis on the correct syllables. "That was the Perfesser's doing. But that's all gone now."     "The what?" Sam demanded.     "The Perfesser," Robin replied. "You know..." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Lotho," he muttered subaudibly.     "Lotho?" Frodo and Morrie gasped loudly. "Lotho Bagg-"     "Quiet! Don't say it so loud!" Robin cringed. "It's Bad Luck, saying the Name. It's accursed. He's responsible for everything!"     "So these ugly brick buildings an' slate roofs, that's his fault?" Sam cried. "That ugly little bastard!"     "No, no," Robin stammered. "You've got it all wrong. The slate's good! Really good! Look, look, you don't get it, I'll explain it to you."     "Some long exposition's coming, I just knew it," Sam grumbled.     "Y'see," Robin Wheelburrow began, as his audience pulled up chairs and settled in for a long dull speech, "a while back some ugly squint-eyed Men came up from the South, selling magazine subscriptions to make their way through some College called Eyesore, or so they said. And most people turned 'em away and slammed doors in their faces. But old L-" he stopped, and then whispered the name " - old Lotho wanted folk to think he was educated, as if anyone would believe that, and so he took 'em in. And he fed 'em breakfast cereal an' bran flakes and in exchange they told him all about College. And so old - " again Robin whispered the name " - old Lotho decides he's gonna start a College of his own, here in the Shire. So he starts using his money to build these big gothic buildings, and a lot of books and suchlike, and starts to call himself the Perfesser. Put a lot of money into it, too. Started by getting a lot of cash from Bree, where he said it was an invest-mint, by which he meant he was putting a mint o' money into his vest, I guess. Anyway, then the economy starts going haywire, so he gets everybody to take out these student loans, only there's lots o' students and not much loaned, or so it seems to us. But he just keeps sayin' things like, If you think Edjucation is expensive, try Ignorance, an' A Mind is more terrible than a Waist, an' stuff like that, which sounded like some pretty meaningless platitudes from an ad agency if you ask me but people seemed to buy it, an' before long everybody's signing up to be a Student."     "You mean Lotho was teaching people things?" Frodo asked, having a hard time getting the gist of the conversation over the voice shouting angrily in his head.     "Well, he tried to, at first," Robin continued, as everyone settled back in for another trying bout of exposition. "But being a Baggins he didn't know very much to start with - begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo," he added hastily, remembering he was bound and Frodo was holding a sword, though admittedly holding it at the wrong end. "So he started saying, What College really is about, is Football, and he has this big wood Stadium built. An' that's really when the trouble started.     "Y'see, the Chief - " here Robin smiled, saying the name with pride - "the Chief, see, he didn't hold with building with wood. An' every day as the Perfesser had people bringing in wood an' putting up supports for the Stadium, that night the Chief would sneak in under cover of dark an' chop the Stadium to pieces. An' after a month or two of this the Perfesser sets guards all around the Stadium, and two nights later they manage to capture the Chief, and the Perfesser says they're gonna hang him the very next night, big public hanging, lots o' celebration and refreshments an' everything, just like the old-fashioned Shire lynchings Grampa used t' talk about.     "And true to his word next day there's lots of parties and celebrations, and the Perfesser's got lots of gin and brandies he's serving to everyone, an' as dusk comes he sets off all these fireworks to keep people entertained, like Gandalf used to: the big Wheel o' Fortune, an' the Jeopardy, an' one of those SurPrise is Right ones; with the little Bob Barkers, always been kind o' scared o' those myself, but some people seem to like 'em.     "And right at midnight, just as tradition calls for, right at midnight the Perfesser looks at the gallows and says: Do you have anything to say before I pass sentence? And the Chief, he just looks down from the trapdoor, and he smiles, and in a big booming voice he says this:     "I have only this to say, says he. No Stadium shall stand in the Shire. The wood is your enemy, not I! Get rid of it, and quickly! You do not know your peril.     "And the Perfesser just laughs, and a bunch of his cronies - the ones with tenure, anyway - laughs along with him, and he raises his hand to pull the lever, when the smile just sort of dies on his lips and the Perfessor just stands there staring at the sky.     "And then we saw these things. Don't know what you'd call 'em, really; folk now call 'em the fire-flies, on account of they look like little moths that carry their own lanterns along with 'em. Damndest things. Nobody's really quite sure where they came from, but most think they were attracted to the fireworks the Perfesser'd been setting off. And one of 'em lands right on top of the gallows, and in a few seconds the noose-rope catches fire and burns right through and the Chief's free. And two or three others alight on the Stadium, and within minutes the whole thing's burning. Others started landing on homes, sheds, gardens, you name it; and before you know it the whole Shire is ablaze! The Perfesser, he tried to run, but before he could get more'n fifty feet a huge blazing piece of the Stadium tore loose an' landed on him an' crushed him an' set fire to him an' broke his back an' lit him on fire an'-"     "We get the idea," Pipsqueak yawned.     "Well, anyway," Robin went on, "the Chief gets down, and just as if he knew all along what was going to happen he calls everyone together an' forms squads, and he sends people to get buckets, an' forms one line down to the River an' another to the Lake, an' sends people to the areas downwind to evacuate and sound the alarm, like he'd been preparing for this day all his life. An' after the fires are put under control he calls a big meeting, and he says This is the way things are going to be from now on, an' he says what to do, an' everyone just ups and does what he says. And he got rid of all the wood everywhere, and nationalized all the student loans, and redistributed the sources of private fortunes, and had us rebuild everything proper, and gave us the new Rules to live by. And now all's well as ends better!"     "Rules?" Morrie snapped. "What rules?"     "Didn't you see them?" Robin replied, proudly gesturing with his nose towards one wall. "The Rules. There's copies everywhere."     The four hobbits turned to look, and saw a document carefully embroidered into a non-flammable fabric hung upon one wall:                     --- The Rules ---  1. There shall be NO MORE WOOD. We shall build a mighty Wall to     keep it out.  2. Any individual who hoards wealth greater than 0.25% of the     total Shire economy shall either redistribute it for the     common good or be put to quick and painful death.  3. All food, supplies and drinks shall be shared equitably by all     people, as moderated by the People's Board of Sharing.  4. Due to unacceptable health and social risks, beer, alcohol and     pipe-weed are hereby banned from the Shire forever.  5. Except in times of civil emergency, only Shrrrfffs are allowed     to carry weapons. Sword-control laws shall henceforth be     rigorously enforced.  6. All new buildings must be constructed of non-flammable materials     in accordance with the new SNSI building codes.  7. The use of fireworks within the Shire is absolutely and expressly     forbidden for all time.  8. Spitting within the Shire will no longer be tolerated.  9. Never, EVER, speak of He Who Must Not Be Named.  10. Thou shalt not bear false witness.  11. Neither a borrower nor a lender be.  12. Please wipe your feet before entering or leaving the Shire.     There was a long silence as the travellers contemplated all they had heard. Finally Sam spoke. "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute," he growled, disbelief twisting in the pit of his stomach. "Are you saying," he gargled, "are you saying the Revolution's already come, and I've missed it?"     "Yeah," Robin said cheerfully. "Isn't it great?"     Sam turned away in astonishment, too amazed to even attempt dialect. Morrie gathered the others together. "This is ludicrous," he snapped. "We didn't explore smuggling and business opportunities throughout Gondor and Rohan just so we could find ourselves demoted to peasant laborers when we got back. We represent the three richest dynasties in our countryside. We've got to do something."     "Like what?" Pipsqueak said obediently.     "Raise the Shire!" Morrie answered overdramatically. "You can see that everyone hates this - everyone who's important, anyway," he added, with a disparaging glance towards the bound Shrrrfff - "and they'll all be eager to see these grubby little peasants set back to rights. We'll get the Families. Tonight we'll sneak out under cover of darkness and get our clans together, and tomorrow we'll have a secret meeting to plot counterrevolutionary terror. With good planning we'll be back at the top of our ivory towers within a week and this 'Chief' will be a beggar in the wilderness. Or better still a beggar in the Brandywine with fancy new cement overshoes."     "What about Sam?" Frodo asked in a rare display of cognizant thinking.     "Sam," Morrie snapped. "Stupid leftist bastard. We'd better eliminate him." And in a flash he drew steel and whipped around, only to find the door open and Gamgee gone. "Damn him!" Morrie shouted. "He's escaped! We'll have to start moving now, before he can raise the cry against us. To the Families! Steal ponies and ride, ride hard! Bring all the forces you can muster to the Three-Farthing Stone by midday. The Counterrevolution begins!"     With that the three ran enthusiastically to the door, Morrie only hesitating long enough to put a sword-point through Robin Wheelburrow's defenseless throat.     Frodo, after stealing a pony but accidentally drowning it in the River, snuck through the grass on foot near the Sackville-Baggins estate. What he had seen of this part of the Shire was striking: instead of living in holes in the ground hobbits were now living in charming aboveground homes of stucco and stone, with little balconies and modest terrazzo sunrooms, and everyone seemed happy and well-fed. Even people he recognized as being his former wage-slaves seemed as content as he'd ever seen them. He withheld a shudder and continued on.     At last he neared the Sackville-Baggins mansion, and was surprised to see it partially burned, since he hadn't paid much attention to the story; but workmen were rebuilding the walls with stately brick, and keeping what they could of the elegant windows, and new marble stairs led up to the porch. But Frodo was unprepared for the sign: where originally Lobelia had a sign which read PRIVATE PROPERTY: STAY OUT OR BE SHOT, now there was a stone marker which read simply, SACKVILLE-BAGGINS CHARITY HOSPITAL - ALL WELCOME.     What the hell? echoed Bilbo's angry voice in Frodo's head. Charity my eye. Probably steals their wallets or something. Ugly old pincushion. Get up there! Ring the bell, you knock-kneed little twerp.     Frodo, fearing to get too close to the happy workmen, who might be somewhat less happy if they recognized him, fought down Bilbo's mutterings and instead went towards the back of the property, where he wormed his way in through a half-burned back door. In a moment or two he found himself face-to-face with Mumbo Sackville, a third cousin twice removed, once via the front door and once through a plate-glass window.     "Frodo?" Mumbo said in astonishment, lifting his reading glasses. "We hoped - well, that is, we thought you were dead."     Book-learned and about as useful as a drugged wombat, Bilbo's voice commented drily.     "Mumbo!" Frodo answered, feigning affection. "Is Lobelia here? And the rest of the clan? It's business, important business, and I'm in a hurry, so no gumbo."     "We were just heatin' up a pot," Mumbo said sadly. "But if you insist. Grandma's downstairs, in the fruit cellar. I'll just go upstairs and get Norman. And the rest; most of the family's here these days. Tendin' to patients, they are. Though Grundy's tryin' to tow a carriage out o' the swamp." And with that Mumbo departed, leaving Frodo alone to some inexplicable dread and the sound of squealing violins echoing in his mind. He slowly descended to the fruit cellar, and there, in the glow of a single bare lantern, he found Lobelia, sitting in a swivel chair facing away from him.     "Lobelia?" Frodo asked cautiously.     The chair swung around, slowly, ominously. The face of Lobelia looked at him. Her eyes seemed, to him, to be deep and empty, but suddenly the flash of recognition shot through them, and slowly she rose to face him.     "Lobelia," he said softly, "it's Frodo. Frodo Baggins. I need your help."     "I'll give ye help, ye dirty thieving ruffian!" Lobelia screamed, and suddenly began hammering at Frodo with her heavy iron umbrella. When the other Sackville-Bagginses arrived, it took five of them to drag her off him.     "Wait, wait, Nibs!" old Tom Cotton shouted. "It's Sam, Sam Gamgee by the look of him. Though he don't look like he's changed clothes in about a year." Nibs lifted his pitchfork and cautiously stepped off of Sam's chest, and Farmer Cotton helped him up. "Hullo, Sam!" he said eagerly, pumping Sam's hand in a piston-like handshake. "We'd heard you were dead, or selling aluminum siding, which pretty much amounts to the same thing."     "I'm fine," Sam gasped. "Except for my chest. And my hand. Look. Mr. Frodo's back, and Mr. Morrie and Mr. Pipsqueak as well, and they're planning to seize power. They're gathering their forces or somesuch. We've got to be ready to put the screws to them and step on 'em like last week's tunafish!"     "Can't say it doesn't sound like fun," Farmer Cotton opined. "Though the Revolution was surprisingly bloodless, y'know, and folks here mostly just wants t' live in peace with dignity and reasonably favorable economic circumstance. Once the gap between the rich an' poor was leveled off, most people realized they really wasn't in the mood for bloodshed. When everybody had enough to eat, and a warm place to stay and some opportunities for bettering themselves in different ways, people got more peace-loving and really weren't all that interested in class warfare any more. That's called non-hoarded prosperity giving dignity to all, that is. The Chief taught us that."     "But they're out to ransack the Shire and take back control of everything," Sam garbled.     "Well, that won't do, I suppose," Farmer Cotton replied. "Though a little bit of capitalism and potential for profit isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fosters thriftiness and innovation. It's just when wealth gets all centralized and you get a class of have-nots that it starts runnin' into trouble. But if you say they're plannin' to take over the whole Shire, well, then I suppose I could call a few o' the boys an' put the word out. Shoudn't take more'n, oh, about a week. Then we can discuss the possible social and political ramifications of such an attack at next month's potluck. Hey, d'you still make that potato salad you used t' make?"     Sam choked on his answer when he saw Rosie - lithe, riveting Rosie - come out of the farmhouse wearing a striking red dress. She had been listening at the window. "I think you look fine, Sam!" she yelled. "But if you'd been so interested in killing Mr. Frodo, why didn't you do it months ago?"     This was too much for Sam. It required either a weak answer, or none.     Pipsqueak rode his stolen pony out towards the northeast of the Shire, towards the Great Smials of Tuckborough, with a heavy heart. He didn't know how the Old Took was going to react. While the Tooks had always run their country with a deadly singlemindedness of purpose, they were never as mercenary nor as obviously greedy as the Bagginses or Brandybucks. Pipsqueak couldn't guess what the Old Took would think of the Counterrevolution, or how he would react to Pipsqueak for suggesting it.     In honesty Pipsqueak didn't know what he thought of it himself. He missed the old Shire, it was true; but the new Shire was neat, and clean, and orderly, and all the hobbits he had seen seemed happy, with the exception of the one whose pony he had stolen. "Sorry, sorry," he had mumbled apologetically. "Really very sorry. I'll bring it back when I'm done. Here's a receipt." And after finishing the paperwork he rode off with a curious guilty feeling. Where did that come from, he wondered? In his childhood stealing ponies was as common as singing songs, or beating up peasant children.     At last the gateway to the Great Smials, a stone archway erected long ago by the Keebler Elves to guard their ancient ovens, came into sight. Pipsqueak dashed through it, tethered his pony, put a coin in the meter and ran up to the ancient ancestral door. Half a dozen arrow-tips appeared at tiny holes around the edge of the doorway, a time-honored ritual dating back to Goribund Took the Solicitor-Free. "What d'ye want?" said the deep menacing voice of the door-ward within.     "I am Paragraph Took, son of Palatine Took and Macy Loosemoral," Pipsqueak answered. "I seek an audience with the Old Took."     "Paragraph Took? We'd heard young Paragraph was dead. Prove your identity!"     Pipsqueak nodded. So it was to be the Trial. He understood. "I stand ready," he replied, as was the ancient custom, "and on afterburners."     "Who delved the Great Smials?"     "Isengrim it was, Isengrim the Mighty, maker of the Forge, Digger of the Great Doorsill, and - " he stood on one leg " - Wielder of the Ill-Omened Shovel."     The voice sounded pleased. "Why are the Smials underground?"     Pipsqueak recited the ancient linnod by rote. "Why shouldn't they be? Everything's gotta be somewhere. Mind your own business!"     Again the voice was satisfied. "Can you produce the Ancient Key?"     "C-flat," Pipsqueak replied obediently, humming one scale. "It's kept under the Mat."     "Well, then, use it and come in."     "Right."     Pipsqueak flipped up the mat, grabbed the rusty key, and let himself in. Inside the Great Hall things had not been changed, and he was reassured to see his coat-hanger was still empty. "Good to see you, Pipsqueak," the doorward, Fahrenheit Took, said. "We'd heard you were dead, or maybe selling aluminum siding, which amounts to the same thing."     "I don't know how these rumors get started," Pipsqueak muttered.     "You made it in time for breakfast," Farrie continued, gesturing up the Central Stair. "It's the Count today, you know, chocolaty marshmallows? Most have already finished, but everybody's still there, awaitin' the High One. Hasn't eaten yet."     "Good, that's good," Pipsqueak answered. "I need to talk to everybody, and I haven't much time." With that he darted up the stairs, and burst into the Great Hall of Breakfast set in its mighty chamber.     The sun shone through the high eastern windows, reflecting down upon the great velvet curtains, red and electric blue, which always used to give him a nosebleed when he looked too hard at them. Forsaking his usual spot he went directly to the Adults' Table, without permission, a thing only done by three Tooks in all of history, and two of them were still to this day stuck downstairs doing dishes. "Hear me!" he shouted, and the table gave way to consternation then fell silent. "There is a rebellion planned against the Chief. It is taking place today! I must know if Tooks will support it or not. I must have an audience with the Old Took!"     There was a hush. The High One's seat at the head of the table was empty. Everyone else seemed a little stunned. "Paragraph," old Adalgrime finally said quietly, "the Old Took is dead."     Pipsqueak stood long in stunned silence. "Dead?" he whispered.     "Yes," Adalgrime replied. "Didn't you see the new polo mallet's been added? Happened when the College burned down. The Old Took fell alongside..." here a venomous contempt crept into Adalgrime's voice "...the Perfesser. He thought he'd get tenure, and a wing named after him, but instead he got the Ash and the Fire."     "Oh, my Eru," Pipsqueak gasped. This was too much. The Old Took was the only leader Pipsqueak, and most other Tooks, had ever known. "But... if he's dead..."     "No leader can stand forever," said a new voice, ringing from the shadows. All heads turned to the darkened entranceway at the high end of the table. "Even the Old Took could not prevail against Time. But a new leader of the Tooks has been chosen." A figure could be faintly seen approaching the table, walking slowly but with great strength and dignity out of the shadows.     "Paragraph," the figure continued, "you are welcome. You have brought us news, and have even come to the Adults' Table, risking infinite washing and dishpan hands, to do so. I appreciate your sacrifice. But now, you must keep silent. It is my job to decide how the Tooks shall proceed in this crisis." And with that the High One entered the light, and cast back the hood of the cloak.     Pipsqueak swallowed. "...c..." he stammered. "...Cassie?"     The paths to Brandy Hall had changed. The main road was still in its normal place, of course, though it had been repaved with beautiful new fishscale stones, and the slums had all been burned and then elegantly rebuilt. But Morrie, who never took the main road because he knew it was full of potential witnesses, took his usual back-way through the trees and under Deadman's Hollow.     The trees were gone. The back-way road was now an amiable brick thoroughfare, and where he expected the entrance to the Hollow he instead found, to his horror, a double row of gift shops and small restaurants and a couple of bed-and-breakfasts. A short pier at the River where Morrie had more than once dropped off business associates attached to large rocks now stood host to a large tour-boat, its sign touting SCENIC RIVER TOURS OF THE BRANDYWINE - THREE TIMES A DAY! He stared in amazement and then rode on, two or three couples in a sidewalk cafe idly looking up to watch him pass.     Even the Hollow was paved! Only a few ashes remained of the scrubland which used to provide cover from prying eyes. Morrie felt like he was in an alien world. Even the scrubbed and disinfected land of Gondor felt more slippery and dishonest than this - this, the very place where he had first learned his craft! Whoever this Chief was, he was going to pay for all this with his life.     At last he reached the stables of Brandy Hall. He breathed a sigh of relief; here, at least, things didn't look as wholesome. Mordred Brandybuck was still there, and still cursing his horses as usual. "You foul useless nag!" he was shouting at one sweaty, exhausted horse. "Get the hell back onto that track or I'll fill a glue bottle out o' ye!"     Morrie greeted him in the traditional Brandybuck way. "Get the hell out my way, you ugly mangy old bastard! Or I'll ride you down."     Mordred looked up him, and squinted. "Who the hell are you?" he sneered. "This is still private property, y'know, whatever the so-called Chief might say. We don't hold with all these so-called 'community property laws' out here."     Morrie smiled. This was more to his liking. "Glad to hear it," he replied. "Go wake the Family! There's business to discuss. I want to put out a hit. A big hit. There's a so-called Chief I want to take and put in an all-wood box."     The older man regarded the younger in amazement. "An' what name shall I give the Family?" he asked.     Morrie smiled. "Moribund Brandybuck," he grinned intimidatingly.     "'Scuse me?"     Morrie was amazed to find the older man staring at him in disbelief. "Mor-i-bund Brand-y-buck!" he enunciated. "You know? Morrie? The Mobster? Moribund son of Sorrowduck? The four-year-old kid who stabbed your favorite horse in the fetlock and got away with it because you were scared of him? You know damned well who I am, old man. I'm your worst nightmare."     The older man's eyes betrayed fear, but he was still defiant. "I don't know who the hell you are, you foul-tempered little whelp," he snapped, "but you sure as hell ain't Morrie Brandybuck. I know Morrie. I've worked with Morrie. Kid," he continued with a sneer, "you're no Morrie Brandybuck."     Morrie was beside himself. He pushed himself out of the way. "Ain't I?" he shouted, drawing steel. "Ain't I? Where do you think I am, then? Missing? Dead? Selling aluminum siding? Listen, stable boy," he sneered, holding his sword-point at Mordred's throat, "you tell the Family I'm here or you'll be in a glue bottle yourself faster than you can say Elmer."     Mordred stared back angrily, and with more defiance than Morrie was accustomed to seeing from anyone, but at length he turned on his heel and walked towards the back entry of the Hall. Bucklebelt Hall! It was good to see it again. Morrie noted there was fire damage here, too, but not too extensive. Having the River close by the house probably made the difference.     "Hey," he heard the old man call inside. "There's someone out here demanding to see the Family... That's right... And he claims he's Morrie Brandybuck!"     Morrie let his gaze wander. Even here there were stacks of fresh-cut granite blocks, over by the fieldhands' entrance, awaiting the renovation of the Hall. Might not be such a bad idea, he had to admit. More secure in case of siege. Extra stones could be handy for drowning difficulties. He was considering how to pave over some old burial sites when the Family began filing out.     There was Mordred again, stupid old fool. There were Gorbadass and Marmadoc, who started the Insurance; they'd be with him. There was Rorimac - Old Rory, 'The Goldfather'. He knew a good thing when he'd seen it. He'd go with the plan. There was Madoc, the proud-necked fool, and that ugly old Hanna; they'd protest, but it'd need more than them to vote him down. There was Gorbulas, and Mentha; they could be swayed. And there was...     No.     It couldn't be.     "This absolutely can not be happening," Morrie said in a dangerous growl.     "Oh, ho, it can," the figure answered happily. "Ja, ja! A long trip it was, ho ja, yet here I am, back in the embrace uf my luffing Family. Happy am I to be here! And who are you, there, stranger?"     "You know damned well who I am," Morrie shouted. "You know damned well why I'm here! What I can't figure out is what you're doing here. What'd you do, Otto? Sweep the floors? Offer to dust their countertops? Did you bring your cleaning supplies with you, you filthy Nordic bastard?"     Otto grinned. "'Otto'?" he asked happily, stroking his beard. "Nope. Must be someone else you've been thinking of there. My name ist Morrie Brandybuck, und this is my home, ant these people are my luffing Family! We are all very happy together, ja! But perhaps you are mistaken. Perhaps you are gone to the wrong House?"     Morrie allowed himself one brief moment of shock and disorientation, then put it aside and jumped off his pony with steel in hand and fire in his eyes. "I should have killed you in the White Tower, janitor," he sneered. "But I'll have more fun doing it here at home, slowly." He stepped forward, and was stopped dead by the sound of ten cutlasses appearing in the hands of his family members.     They were all pointing at him.     "You even think it," Old Rory said slowly but with great presence, "and you'll be dead before you hit the River. Or you'll wish you were."     "I can't believe this," Morrie expostulated. "Look at me! This is what I look like! Now look at him! The beard! The bushy eyebrows! The hands calloused from scrubbing bathrooms! Does he even look like me? Did you recognize him when he came home to Mother? Did you?"     "Well, no," old Rory admitted. "But that's to be expected. He was much changed, you know, due to his travels and all."     "That's lunacy!" Morrie shouted. "He was much changed because he's an impostor! A badly-dressed, short, ugly, lice-infested bleach-drinking impostor with an impossible dialect! Now look at me! Look: the dueling scar! The knife-cut over the ear! The beady, glinting eyes! Look," he said, reaching into a pocket for his greatest personal treasure, "my old brass knuckles with 'Punched By Morrie Brandybuck' engraved on the front surface in relief! They were a gift from you, Rory-"     "Ja, ja," Otto cut in quickly. "I lost those! You must've found them."     "-so why don't you admit that you made a mistake, throw this guy into the rendering vat and welcome me home?"     The Family looked at him indecisively, then turned to Old Rory. The old man regarded him slowly for a long moment. "Well, there is a resemblance," Rory owned. "You do look and sound a fair lot like him. Though the real Morrie didn't float two inches off the ground like that."     Morrie looked. He was floating. Stupid Ment-draughts!     "I'll give you one chance," Rory continued. "Prove to us that you are Morrie Brandybuck. I'll ask each of you one question. The one of you that gets the answer right can stay. The one that gets it wrong will be banished. If he's lucky.     "Seven years ago," Old Rory continued, "Gorbadass and Marmadoc were collecting insurance from the Hardgirdles. Fiona Hardgirdle refused to pay the premium. What happened three nights later? Stranger?" His level gaze fell on Morrie.     "That's easy," Morrie smiled grimly. "Marmadoc took Fiona's son Finkle for a ride. He took him on the Mild Swamp Run, extra-slow. Next morning Fink was found half-drowned in a peanut-butter truck. He kept shouting something about 'worms, worms in the deep'. Fiona paid Gorbadass the protection money promptly that afternoon along with a 15% gratuity."     Old Rory nodded once, slowly. He turned to Otto. "Morrie," he proceeded, "seven years ago Gorbadass and Marmadoc were collecting insurance from the Hardgirdles. Fiona Hardgirdle refused to pay the premium. What happened three nights later?"     "I don't know. What?" Otto answered genuinely.     "Fiona's son Finkle was found half-drowned in a peanut butter truck the next morning," Rory continued. "They say he was found shouting 'worms, worms in the deep'. Fiona paid her insurance premium that afternoon and it never happened again."     "Really? Gosh!" Otto replied automatically. "First I'd ever heard uf that kind uf story. What an amazing, um, thing! Nope, completely news to me. First I'd ever heard uf any such story like that one there."     "Ah-HA!" Morrie shouted. "See? See? Ha ha ha haa! That settles it, then!"     Old Rory looked at him slowly. "That's right," he answered quietly, "it does." He stepped slowly up alongside Otto. Morrie could see fire burning in his eyes. "A lot of people in the Shire have heard all the rumors about old Fiona. But a Brandybuck..."     Here his eyes lifted, and fell full on Morrie.     He put his arm around Otto. Morrie felt a cold nausea stirring in the pit of his soul.     "A true Brandybuck," Rory continued, "would never admit to knowing anything about it."     It was three hours past midday, and Frodo was getting worried. He was at the Three-Farthing Stone, a handful of Bagginses and Sackvilles accompanying him, and there had been no sign of Morrie or of Pipsqueak. Okay, Pipsqueak was unreliable. He probably got lost or went into an amusement park or something. But Morrie was as punctual as Death. What could be delaying him? Had Sam caught him?     He looked around again. The Three-Farthing Stone used to be such a joke. Legend had it that old Jatuzik Oldbuck had planted the stone at the exact center of the Shire's main road-crossing as a traffic obstacle, then offered to remove it for the sum of three farthings. Absolutely no one would pay him, though, and everyone just got into the habit of going around it. Now, Mumbo Sackville had explained to him, it had become revered. "During the night of the Fire, six fire-flies landed on it," he explained. "Three of them got squashed under the Chief's Axe, and young Odo Bigfoot rolled the stone over onto the other three to crush 'em. It helped turn the tide that night. Now everybody's saying the Stone's a national treasure, and old Jatuzik put it there by divine inspiration. Might even be true, for all I know," Mumbo had added, having the decency to look slightly embarassed.     And now there was this Park. They'd repaved the roads, moving them several yards off to the side as they did so, and now the area of mud and dried twigs had been cleared and neatly landscaped, picnic tables put in, and fresh green grass planted and generously watered. A small fountain had been built around the Stone, and the water tinkled merrily over the soaking obelisk. When had this happened? It couldn't have been very long; yet the fifteen or twenty Sackville-Bagginses there were eating and playing lawn darts as though they'd been doing it there for years. Frodo had even watched a little child from a peasant family, not more than three or four, walk up to the Three-Farthing Stone, touch it gently like a holy talisman, then blush and run away. What the hell had become of the Shire? Where the hell was Morrie?     At last he heard a sound: the sound of ponies, and a disheartening little honk, honk which he recognized as a cheap souvenir Horn of Rohan. He stood. From eastward came the trudging of ponies, not more than fifteen or twenty, with Morrie riding slowly in the lead. He looked like he'd been dragged through a swamp, and maybe a river and some gravel as well.     "Morrie!" Frodo shouted. "Morrie! Thank Eru! I thought you'd never get here."     Morrie looked pained. "Otto," he whispered. "Call me Otto."     "What? But, Morrie, you-"     "Otto! Look, just shut up, I'm in no mood to explain. This it?" Morrie asked, gesturing to the fifteen or so disgruntled relatives Frodo had brought with him.     "Uh, yeah," Frodo admitted. "This is what I could find. Most of the family..." He swallowed. This was hard to admit. "Most of the family seems to like things now." Frodo saw the look in Morrie's eyes and swallowed. "Maybe it's because Lotho was-"     "Don't say the Name!" a chorus of nearby Sackvilles hissed.     "-was responsible for all this," Frodo continued. "They seem to feel... guilty," he ended, the very concept of the word feeling alien and unfamiliar in his mouth. A Baggins, feel guilty? It was like saying they were made of cream cheese. "But what about you? Where's the rest of the Brandybucks?"     "Not coming," Morrie said shortly.     "Not coming!" Frodo said in amazement. "But you said you'd bring an army. You said almost everyone in the Hall would support you."     "I did," Morrie replied in a monotone. "These are the Brandybucks who don't support Morrie."     Frodo just stared. The Brandybucks dismounted, and began mixing with the Sackvilles and Bagginses. They had brought some provisions, including fresh Kool-Aid and more potato salad, which they proceeded to share. "Unbelievable," Morrie grumbled to himself. "About as rebellious as a plate of cheese fries. Pipsqueak been here yet?"     "No," Frodo replied, nursing an umbrella bruise. "He's probably out eating cotton candy or something."     "Well, maybe this'll do," Morrie muttered to himself. "We use a few to create a distraction, maybe start a fire if anyone in this rabble still knows how to light one. That ought to bring this Chief and his ilk, and if this pile of apes can make a clear path to him you and I can move in for the kill. No, maybe I'll go in by myself," he added, looking again at Frodo. "We'll set up in Bywater; Bywater's good ambush country. With a few more people we'd have better odds of doing it and staying alive afterwards, but if we can retreat quickly-"     "Look!" Frodo gasped in amazement.     Along the northeast road they could see troops - troops, a hundred strong already visible in the distance and more appearing, the sun glinting off their many swords wielded proudly in direct defiance of Rule Five. A familiar figure strode proudly at their head. "I'll be damned," Morrie said in amazement. "Pipsqueak! Pipsqueak Took! Who would ever believe he could do anything right? And he's got at least a hundred Tooks with him!"     In fact it was fully three hundred; all of Took-land had emptied with the news, and Pipsqueak had been put in charge of them all. Onward they came: Fahrenheit, and Faraslax, and Roquamunda Took, and Pancho and Sancho, and Adalgrime, and Torquamanda, and fiery Tabasco, and even Oleomargarine Took sitting straight and proud in his wheelchair. They filled the picnic benches and overflowed them, spilling out everywhere onto the grass. At last Frodo saw the one Took he was especially hoping to see.     "Cassiopeia!" he blurbled, going up to the beautiful young Took. "Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've thought about you!"     "Paragraph told me you were here," Cassiopeia replied sweetly.     "Oh, it's gonna be grrreat," Frodo said stupidly, like a half-witted breakfast cereal ad. "We're going to kill the Chief and his men and restore the old socioeconomic order and reestablish an unfavorably weighted capitalist economic system. After that, mmmaybe..." He paused. He swallowed. "...mmmmmmaybe I could take you for a milkshake?"     "Hmm," Cassiopeia answered noncommittally, though she was still smiling. "I admit I'm very interested in what you're planning. So tell me: what kind of scheme do you have for dealing with the Chief?"     Frodo told her, making sure it sounded like his idea and not Morrie's. "Now that we've got more people, we might make some changes," he added. "But I'm sure it'll be Bywater, tonight. Afterwards maybe we can get together and celebrate."     Cassiopeia smiled brightly. "Oh," she said simply, "after tonight there'll be a celebration, all right. You can count on it." And with that she shot him one final mysterious grin and vanished back into the crowds.     Frodo felt very pleased with himself. I wish I still had the Ring, he thought to himself.     I wish I did, too, Bilbo thought angrily back. And we'd have it now, if you didn't have clam chowder for brains. This place is a damnable mess! How can you even think in here?     That night their plans were made. On the Hobbiton Road in Bywater, not far from Bagshot Row and the dwellings of the Chief, the mutineers brought cartloads of wood which had been hoarded by the Brandybucks in direct violation of Rule One. At dusk they set the wood up for a huge bonfire in the middle of the road; and the rebels, three hundred thirty strong, took their positions in hiding at Pipsqueak's command as Morrie and Frodo went ahead to light the bonfire. "I'm looking forward to finding out who this so-called 'Chief' is," Morrie sneered. "I'm going to make him suffer for what he's done to the Shire. And after he's dead," he added malevolently, "I'm going to go after that bastard Otto."     "I thought you said you were Otto," Frodo frowned.     "Skip it," Morrie grumbled. "Do you have a tinderbox? Or a match?"     "Nope," Frodo replied.     "No?" Morrie snapped, furious.     "No!" Frodo replied. "I dropped my pack when we were running from the fire! Remember?"     "That was back at the beginning of the chapter," Morrie sneered. "Nobody can remember back that far."     Certainly not the readers, Bilbo echoed.     "Well, can't you light it?" asked Frodo.     "You can't guess?" Morrie snapped. "I can't believe you even had to ask. You brainless antelope."     You'd resent that, Bilbo added, if you weren't so damned stupid.     "Look, just shut up! -No, not you, Morrie. Otto. Whatever," blundered Frodo. "Look, I've just never lit a fire before, okay? That's menials' work. It's beneath me! Look," he continued, recoiling under Morrie's deadly gaze, "what do you expect me to do, anyway? Catch a Rogling? Steal some fresh fire from the Gods? Ask Sam to drop by and-"     "Oh, I'm already here," Sam replied.     "-light it for us? No, Morrie, Otto, whatever, if you're so damn smart, you'd..." Frodo continued, finally trailing off into a stupefied silence. He and Morrie turned. Sam was standing a short distance away, along with Rosie and a handful of stout peasants carrying a dangerous array of sharpened farm implements. In the shadows behind them Frodo could make out a small line of bowmen.     "Well, the worm has turned," Sam Gamgee announced. "I warn ye: you are standing in the light, directly under a streetlight actually which was very bad planning if I may say so, and ye are covered by archers. If you two do so much as sing a song with conservative lyrics I'll have ye both shot. Drop y'r unregistered illegal weapons and step back five paces! O'course ye don't have to if ye don't want to," he added maliciously.     Frodo dropped his sword, only to be kicked by Morrie. Morrie began laughing derisively. "Sooo! You think we're trapped? You think we're caught? Not likely, you sniping proletariat bastard. I think I've been looking forward to this moment even more than Frodo. Mutineers!" he cried in a great voice. "Attack!"     There was a great cry, and out of the darkness came Pipsqueak and his army of three hundred thirty armed rebels. They ran forward, with Morrie and Frodo quickly joining them. Sam and his small group drew their weapons and prepared to make a last stand worthy of a highly liberal song when a new cry, deep within the mutineers' ranks, rang out in a woman's piercing voice:     Tooks! Follow my command!     And the Tooks, three hundred strong, followed the ingenious and secret plans of Cassiopeia, High Thain of the Smials, and turned at once upon the mutinous Brandybucks and Sackvilles and Bagginses, whom they outnumbered ten to one, and tore their weapons away, and took all captive; and Paragraph their captain won renown by dashing forward and hewing Morrie's sword-hand from his arm before that chief of mutineers could harm the noble Sam Gamgee, icon of the proletariat; and Cassiopeia Took herself dashed fearlessly through the ranks of her people in time to deliver a devastating right-hand blow to Frodo Baggins' unresisting glass jaw.     Thus ended the Battle of Bywater, before it really began, and even before anybody could light the bonfire. It was accounted by many the last battle of the Revolution; though some contend the final battle came not then but later, in a land well outside the Shire, and a chapter or so further along. The names of all the mutineers were made into a List, and were carefully memorized by Shire law enforcement officers and immigration officials thereafter. Those named upon it were never cut any slack by anyone ever again; and at the top of the List in all accounts stand the despised names of Otto Who Claims He's Morrie Brandybuck and Frodo Baggins.     Morning came, though little light came through the bars into their cell. For some time Frodo and Morrie had slept fitfully, awakened at whiles by their injuries and the crowds chanting, "Kill! Them! Kill! Them!" rhythmically in the music-filled streets outside. The guards had put a makeshift bandage onto the stub of Morrie's wrist, and there was a chance he might survive, but the odds were against it, and he was weak from loss of blood; and Frodo, though better off, still had a stinging pain in his jaw and the irate voice of Bilbo screaming epithets and one-liners in the darkened corridors of his mind.     After a sullen meal of gruel and soggy breakfast cereal, the two were dragged outside by grim Shrrrfffs. "Come on, you two," the lead Shrrrfff growled, "your lawyer is here."     "Lawyer?" Morrie slurred. "We don't have no lawyer. We don't need no steenking lawyer!" And he would have continued ranting in that vein if he hadn't felt Frodo's hand gripping his injured arm in terror.     "You're our lawyer?" Frodo whispered in horror.     Sam Gamgee grinned. "Court-appointed," he replied cheerfully, "by the local magistrate. You've heard of her, maybe? The Honorable Lobelia Sackville-Baggins? Seems she's become quite civic-minded since the Revolution, helpin' the poor an' runnin' that hospital an' all; positively respectable now, if y' ask me. But, here, now; we need t' get back t' business." He cleared his throat, and took out a short roll of fabric with a long list of charges inked onto it.     "As I understands it," Sam continued, inspecting the roll, "you've been accused of the Murder of Six Shrrrfffs, one of 'em in cold blood, an' Smuggling Wood, an' Preparin' a Bonfire - shame ye didn't get that lit, y'know, because there's a hell of mandatory sentence for that one, an' it looks extreme even to me - an' Gate-breaking, and Breakin' and Enterin', an' Impersonatin' Respected Shire-folk, an' Rebellin' Against the Proper Order of Things - kind of ironic, that one; I always thought I'd be the one arrested for that - and Sayin' the Name, several counts there, an' Spittin' Inside the Shire, an' Unregistered Sword-Handlin', and Stealin' Ponies, an' Drownin' Ponies, that pony belonged to me Uncle Hamlong by the way-"     "It won't stick," Morrie cut in weakly. "Nobody read us our rights."     "Bein' just come from foreign parts, an' not having signed in, ye don't have any," Sam snapped. "Now there's a lot more here, but it's not relevant, you're both obviously guilty, so you may as well decide how ye want to handle it. What'll it be, then? Admit You're Guilty? Then ye'd go into work-release, outside the Wall, at the Quarries; there's a few other prisoners there, an' a surprisin' number of hobbits who are just civic-minded, too. O'course, since everybody remembers you, there's a big chance ye'd 'accidentally' get pushed under a slab-"     "Doesn't sound good," Frodo opined.     "Aye, ye're right," Sam agreed. "Much too quick. How about, Appeal Before The People? In that, ye get up on a big platform and explain to the whole Shire your side of things, and then they decide your fate. Now there's a possibility."     "I'd like that better," Morrie noted tiredly, "if it weren't for all those people over there chanting 'Kill The Interlopers, Kill The Firebugs' and waving all those kitchen utensils."     "Hm, well, it's your business," Sam said sadly. "Well, there's only one other option open."     "Everyone Forgets The Whole Thing?" Frodo cried hopefully.     "Give Us Swords And Let Us Hack Our Way Out?" Morrie suggested.     "Nope, it's Appeal To The High Authority," Sam said levelly, but with a kind of grim smile. He turned to the lead Shrrrfff. "Take 'em to the Chief."     There was an odd holiday sensation - half harvest festival, half public lynching - in the air as the crowds jostled Frodo and the weakening Morrie over The Bridge and towards The Hill. Frodo could just get glimpses of the territory through the thronging, singing people. It looked like most of Hobbiton had been destroyed by the fires, and now had been mostly rebuilt, in a beautiful style that he would have described as Italian or Mediterranian if he knew what "Italian" or "Mediterranian" meant. The ugly Quonset hut that Bilbo had built for the Party was completely destroyed, and a public library and open school now stood in its place. Inside his head he could hear Bilbo howling.     At last the crowds pushed them up The Hill. Here he got his first look at Bagshot Row, many of its mighty houses destroyed or standing as unstable structures of charcoal and ash. Then at the top of the Hill the crowd parted, and he saw Bag End once more, and for a brief moment rejoiced to see it was still standing. But a moment later Frodo found himself squinting in amazement.     All the wood was gone. The wooden windowsills and beams had been replaced by rows of brick, intricate tilework and elegant steel trusses. The round green door was now replaced by a bright red one, with a sort of flower-shaped shield inscribed upon it with four red petals, inscribed with the letters I A F F and the legend "Local 94 - Uniformed Fire Fighters".     The door opened, to a rousing cheer from the populace, and four hobbits came out wearing odd swept-back helmets and thick heavy coats - black coats on the east side of the door, yellow coats on the west - with strips of some Elvish material that took the sunlight and sent it back glowing like a beautiful sunrise back to the eyes. The four came to attention, revealing small argent shields each with a band of sable to remember the fallen, and then the Chief came forth.     The people cheered. The Chief stepped out of the doorway, gestured to his men indicating that they should receive the people's praise before himself, bowed only once (and with, it seemed, embarassment), and then turned towards Morrie and Frodo. In his hands was a large, steel-handled Axe which seemed vaguely, hauntingly familiar, like a childhood memory. To Frodo's surprise the Chief did not look much like Aruman at all, though somehow he had half-expected him to. In fact, though, he looked like... like...     "Fredegar Bolger?" Frodo whispered in amazement.     The Chief looked full upon him. "I can't believe you actually came back!" he shouted, half torn between amazement and anger. "I can't believe you bothered, after all that trouble you went through to leave. And to leave me behind, too, all the way back in the middle of Book One, making sure you'd be going through a forest just so you could get rid of scared old Fatty Bolger! Well, it seems I wasn't needed on your so-called 'Quest', so I made one of my own. And while you were out blundering around, visiting amusement parks and listening to grand opera and investing in Mordor real estate and pharmaceutical industries, I went ahead and saved the Shire and made it into something decent with my time."    "Oh yeah?" Frodo said, sounding surprisingly juvenile. "Oh yeah? Look, we just got back from a great Quest! We threw the Ring into the Fire and put a King in Gondor and defeated the evil Gandalf and-"    "Not what I heard," the Chief replied. "I heard some weird creature named Gullible destroyed the Ring, and that the King took the throne because his father-in-law the loremaster used ancient Brandybuck lore to murder the former Queen, and that Gandalf was actually defeated by some Earthsea dragons and an enraged Elf-lord. I've also heard," he growled, looking at their surprised faces, "that you were working for Sauron, that he'd promised you a large slave-plantation in his Eastern lands, that your friend here was planning to start a major drug trade in Gondor and Edoras-"     "Not true! Not true!" they both cried out.     "Is that a Deed sticking out of your shirt pocket?" he demanded of Frodo. "Is this the pipe-weed distribution network you drew up to show Pipsqueak last week?" he continued to Morrie. "And I also hear," Chief Bolger continued in the stunned silence which followed, "that you were planning to kill me last night and make the Shire an economically-divided plutocracy again."     "I wish we'd succeeded," Morrie hissed.     "Not me!" Frodo shouted, quickly putting some space between him and Morrie. "Not me! It was him! It was his idea! Not mine! I had nothing to do with it! I'm an innocent victim who just happened to be walking by at the time!"     To his surprise he saw Cassiopeia, High Thain of the Tooks, step out of the crowd just off to the right. "Frodo," she said levelly, "you told me it was all your idea. That you thought of everything all by yourself."     Nice move, idiot, noted Bilbo.     Frodo gulped. The weakened Morrie shot him a glance like a fistful of daggers. "Um, uhm, uh," Frodo began articulately, "that was just, uhm, an exaggeration, well, a bald-faced lie actually-"     "You lied to the High Thain of the Tooks?" Fredegar roared.     "Wha, ah, whah, wall, I know it looks like that, but, uh, I, uh-"     Shut up, boy! Bilbo roared in his ears. You're digging the grave deeper every time you open your mouth. Why don't you just slip into a coma and let me take over?     "Enough!" commanded the Chief, and with that one word all of Hobbiton fell into silence. For a long moment the Chief paced back and forth, musing on all that had been said. "Neither of you can be trusted," he finally said quietly. "Not now, not ever. A treacherous blade is dangerous even to its owner. Therefore I pronounce you exiled: you shall leave the Shire forever, and never be allowed to return. The West-gate is just beyond. Go!"     A murmur went through the crowd. "Don't let them go. Kill them! They're a pair of villainous murderers. Kill them!"     "Kill them?" the Chief asked the crowd. "Kill them? What would that serve? Would it brighten the sky, or improve the harvest, or bring the Shrrrfffs back to life? Or would it just make villainous murderers out of us as well? No, you can't fight evil by doing evil yourselves. You can't fight fire with fire. If you try, you just end up with a bigger fire."     The crowd fell into a hush, a quiet hubbub going from hobbit to hobbit as this idea was discussed. When the hubbub stopped Morrie and Frodo could see the people looking at the Chief with, if such a thing was possible, still greater respect. The Thain's voice suddenly lifted up with a cry of, "All hail the wisdom of the Chief!" And the cry was repeated by all, who then fell to cheering and sobbing for joy.     This outburst of good feeling, however, did not stop the crowd from hustling Frodo and the wounded Morrie straight to the West-gate. At the Gate they gave each of them a small bag with three turkey sandwiches, a bottle of Tang, and a map of the area with a marked path leading as far away as possible. Then, as the door-ward pulled back the twenty-three bolts and opened the Gate, Samwise Gamgee appeared with a slight smile on his face.     "I'll probably never see you again, Mr. Frodo," he said quietly. "And that's a shame, because if I ever saw you again I'd almost certainly end up gettin' to kill ye." And with that he drew out a pen and made two entries in the Gate-log:   NAME              PURPOSE                       TIME OUT  TIME BACK   O. Ex-Brandybuck  Wander, suffer &amp; die          8:43 AM   Never   F. Baggins        Suffer, suffer, suffer, etc.  8:43 AM   Even longerThe crowd surged forward. Frodo and the wounded Morrie were shoved outside. The gate closed with a CLANG and a series of twenty-three heavy thungs. Cheers and a song were heard from inside the Gate, gradually receding into the distance as the Shire returned to its many joyful tasks. Morrie and Frodo looked around at the lifeless desolation around them and the half-burned trees stretching off into the distance. A quiet wind, blowing dust, began to rise.     This is one hell of a fine mess you've gotten us into, Bilbo echoed.
        Without a word, Morrie began to drag himself off westward.  Frodofollowed listlessly.  Neither of them had the energy for the inevitableround of backbiting that would certainly follow if either of them openedtheir mouths.  Frodo, moreover, was entirely preoccupied with his internaldialogue.        Stay with me, boy, and I'll get you out of this, it chuckled drily.But Frodo was not so sure; it is hard to trust someone who has torn one'sentrails open.  The sun reached its peak, and without the shade of the treesto shelter them it soon became swelteringly hot.  Every time the wind pickedup ashes blew into their faces and choked them.  Frodo tried closing his eyes,but every time he did so he saw, against the red and purple of his innereyelids, a vision of Gullible silhouetted against the Crack of Doom.        Hours before the shadows grew long, both Morrie and Frodo had finishedtheir bottles of Tang, only to find that they were even thirstier.  Theirsandwiches were dry and salty.  By evening, they were both exhausted; theroad before and behind looked exactly the same, an ash-strewn path surroundedby burnt and fallen tree-trunks on both sides.  The Roglings had done theirwork well.        As the sun set west beyond Unter Den Lindon Frodo collapsed, lyingface down in the dust like a dead man.  Morrie turned back and knelt down bythe body, his one remaining hand checking Frodo's pockets almost by instinct.His hand closed around a letter.  But even as he drew it back he foundhimself unable to rise, and slumped helplessly over Frodo's fallen body.  Thedarkness took them both.        It was the song of a bird that woke Frodo.  He lay still for a while,eyes closed, only gradually feeling the uncomfortable weight of Morrie on hisback.  His memories fluttered in a cloud without connection or meaning, andfor a while at least the Voices were mercifully silent.  A bird, he thought.Where am I then? Hobbiton?  Rivendell?        Frodo's eyes opened to see grey ashes once again.  He tilted his headback a little, and saw -- a green leaf.  This startled him out of his reverie.He jerked his body sharply, and Morrie tumbled off his back with a muffledcurse.  Frodo raised himself on all fours.  As far as the eye could see, theforest floor was awash in a cascade of green leaves.  The black pillars ofthe dead trees stood up stark amidst the greenness, but there too leafy vineswere crawling up their sides.  Frodo almost thought he could see them growingand extending themselves as he watched.        Frodo tried to stand, only to find himself jerked back by one leg.A creeper had coiled itself around his calf.  Grimly, he set himelf to uncoilit.  He was not mistaken; it was putting out leaves even as he did so.          Morrie had put the letter inside his jacket as soon as he had come awakeagain.  The vast greenness, and the piping of the birds, however, dumbfoundedhim.  He sat on the ground and looked about, for once at a loss for words."Where the hell are we?" he asked.        As if in answer, the warbling of birds broke out from all quarters.And a mellifluous, cello-like baritone followed:         Il core vi dono,        Bell'idolo mio;        Ma il vostro vo' anch'io,         Via, datelo a me.        And in response came a beautiful, rich mezzo-soprano:         Mel date, lo prendo,        Ma il mio non vi rendo;        Invan mel chiedete,        Più meco ei non è.        And again the baritone:        Se teco non l'hai, perchè batte qui?        And the mezzo replied:        Se a me tu lo dai, perchè batte qui?        And at last their voices joined in one:        È il mio coricino         Che più non è meco,        Che più non è meco;        Ei venne a star teco,        Ei batte così, ei batte così,        Ei batte così, ei batte così.        With that there was an immense clap of thunder, and a flash of lightningfrom the clear sky.  When the dazzlement left Frodo and Morrie's eyes, they sawstriding toward them across the greenery two tall and beautiful figures, handin hand: one kilted but bare-chested, with a frog-mask; the other likewisetopless, with a skirt of shimmering red ornamented with black web-designsand a fish-mask.  Obviously this was yet another one of those avant-gardeMordortrash productions.        "Shelob!  Sauron!" gasped Frodo.  "But I thought you were... I thoughtshe had enslaved you!"        "Oh, zhoost for a leetle vile," Shelob answered with a smile.  "Vongets szo bored."        "The fall of Barad-dûr trasked her psyche somewhat," said Sauron witha sardonic smile. "And possibly mine as well."        "And did you do this?" Morrie asked, gesturing at the greenery withhis one good arm.        "No," came a voice from behind them.  "That was my doing."  Theyturned and saw Radagast, together with a strange little man in blue and yellow,who began to sing before anyone could stop him:        Ho!  Little hobbit-folk, traipsing through the woods-oo,        Lost amid the burnt trees, hair all full of kudzu!        Where be you a-going now, all your viands eaten?        Tell old Bombadil, or you'll soon be beaten!        And with that he produced a stout cudgel and waved it threateningly atthe hobbits.        "We've been expelled from the Shire!" Frodo blabbed, before Morriecould stop him.  "We're going to wander and suffer until we finally die!  Anduntil I heard Bombadil singing, I had no idea of just how bad this sufferingwould be!"        "Is that so?" said Radagast with a faint smile.  "Well, you have onlyyourselves to blame.  You know that Shelob tried to warn you about it: youburned down your own house when you destroyed Stinky's, she said, if I recallcorrectly."  Shelob beamed.        "You louse!" screamed Morrie.  "You knew that all this would happen,and you let us go ahead without telling us!"        "It was a test," Radagast answered with true Maiarin conviction.  "Tosee how much you have grown up.  And indeed you have grown very great; yousee, Morrie, you're a little taller than the other hobbits..." (and indeed hewas, as he was still floating two inches off the ground) "...and Frodo's alittle taller than you..." (and indeed he was, being six feet tall).        "What about Sam and Pipsqueak?" Frodo asked.        "They failed.  Their progeny will be destroyed when the jungle islet in upon Shire, and the elephants trample down their dwellings, and thetiger and the wolf roam in the streets, and the bitter karela shall coverall."  Sauron smiled ironically, but said nothing.        "Sounds good to me," said Morrie.  "But what about us?  We've gotno food, no drink, and last I heard you couldn't eat kudzu."        "You shall come with us!" said Sauron.        "Indeed," nodded Bombadil, "for we have:        Pepsi and Sierra Mist, potato chips, burritos,        Nachos fit for salsa dip, cheezos and tostitos,        Roasted peanuts too we have, of any beer shall drink ye,        Junk food brought from Bree-way, from Rivendell a twinkie."I'm going as well," added Bombadil.  "The end of the war has really eateninto my illicit activities, and besides, Goldberry threw away the key." With that Frodo and Morrie surged forward, and the two hobbits sat downwith the Maiar and had themselves a woodland feast.        For two days thereafter the six of them pushed onward to the east,and at last entered wooded lands where the fire had not spread.  One nightfallthey saw a strange glow coming from behind a hill, like the light of the moonon the horizon when it rises.  Sauron and Morrie slipped off towards it.  Whenthey came to the crest of the hill, they saw many flashlights lighting theground or the leaves on the trees.  Elvish voices, filled with melodies as ofmany songs, were speaking to each other.        "No, you idiot, it's back that way!"        "If we go in that direction we could be going in circles for days."        "This is what we get for following Dullborn the Wise: 'I used to holdthis area of Gil-gallamine', says he.  'I know a short-cut to the Havens,'says he..."        "Quit complaining!  It's probably just beyond the next hill!"        "That's what you said six hills ago!"        "Peace!" said Sauron in a great voice.  Six flashlight-beams focusedon him at once. "If you seek the path to the west, it is just over the nextrise.  Follow me!"  So they returned to the path, and one by one the Elvesstraggled in.  There were El Rond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, Dullborn andGaladriel, and much to their surprise, Arwen, Queen of Gondor.        "What are you doing here?" Frodo and Morrie asked, but they wereignored until Shelob repeated the question for them.        "If you must know," El Rond said impatiently, "we are seeking a wayout of Muddle-earth.  Time was when this was a pleasant-scented environment,with lavender bath-water and attar of roses... but now these smelly mortalshave made it impossible to breathe freely, so we are going westward, wherewe remember a land of fresh-scented soap still lingers."        "And there too are many golf courses," added Galadriel, "where thetrees do not grow.  Cursed be he who spoiled Lothlorien with his wantonuse of Tree Essence!  No golf has been played on the overgrown links formany a day, alas alas."        "But Arven?" Shelob asked.  "I szought you vos to merry ze fatman, votzisnehm..."        Arwen pouted.  "I said I was going to wed the King of Gondorand Arnor.  And what happens?  No sooner do we get on the throne, thenthere's a rebellion in favor of Orkish Rights or some such nonsense, anda movement for union with Mordor, and before long somebody's proclaiminga Republic and forcing us to leave.  We didn't even get to take ourpalantariums!  He had broken our pre-nup, so I got an instant divorce,natch..."        "So who's in charge of Gondor?"  Morrie said, calculatingfuriously the political ramifications.  Arwen condescended to notice him.        "They had an election," she said.  "Can you believe it!  Anelection! Why, they haven't done such a thing for over 3000 years!  They havea President now: someone named Spiegel, who ran on a platform of Orc-humanreconciliation.  Nothing about Elves, of course."  Morrie wondered brieflywhether Spiegel was corruptible...        "Let us go on," Sauron said.  "There are miles yet to go before wereach the Havens, and we may discuss many things upon the way."        Long was the way they travelled, and bitter was the discussion (forthe Elves even got on each other's nerves), but as they had nowhere else togo they must perforce remain in each others' company until the end of theRoad.  And they came at last to an Elvish city, and entered the gates, andwalked down the long tree-lined boulevard that is named Unter Den Lindon,where Sauron sang many an operetta melody, and so at last came to the quaysof the Havens.        There Captain Cirdan greeted them, and showed them a White Star Linerwaiting to sail over Sea.  Crowds of people thronged the wharves, some toboard the ship, others just to see it, for it was the biggest of its kindever built, and was deemed unsinkable.  And there upon the gangplank stoodtwo clothed in turquoise robes; and one had a staff in his hand and was asugly as a macaque, with a golden circle about his head, and the other wasfat as a hog and held a sharp-tined muckrake.  Then Radagast was glad, forhe knew that Morenaughtie and Rumpustum, the Turquoise Wizards, were leavingMuddle-earth, and he believed that he would be the only Maia left to rulethe whole.        "Now you shall set sail for the Blissed-Out Lands," said Radagast,"and going there your hurts shall be healed forever.  Frodo, Morrie; I takemy leave of you.  May your journey be safe and may your end be what youdesire!"        "What!" exclaimed El Rond.  "I never agreed to sail with mortals!"And to this all of the Elvish company, for once, agreed.        Radagast shrugged.  "Well, I guess you're off the boat," he said toFrodo and Morrie.  "Too bad, but you know Elves are better than other folk."        Then Shelob blew kisses to the hobbits, and she and Sauron andBombadil and the Elves climbed aboard; and the siren sounded, and the shipwas tugged out of the haven, and slowly slipped out through the dank murkywaters of Mithlond harbor.        Frodo stood, dumbstruck for a minute or two.  Then he howled into thedeepening dusk: "Nooo!"  But it was not Frodo's voice.  "El Rond!  Youbastard! You promised me a ticket!  I'll get you if it's the last thing Ido!  My ticket!  I've got a ticket!  My precious..."  And with that he divedinto the ocean where the waiting arms of a beautiful puffer embraced him.        And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed into the West,until at last on a night of fog it struck a gigantic iceberg, and went down;no tale is told in Muddle-earth of who might have survived, although legendscirculated about a seductive eight-finned mermaid and a merman with astentorian baritone voice.        But to Morrie the evening deepened into darkness as he stood at thehaven, seeing only a glitter on the waters that was lost in the West.  Hestood there far into the night, until the noise of the waters repeatedendlessly in his ears became loathsome to him, and he never again went tothe seashore.        He turned around.  Radagast was gone.  The quays were silent anddeserted.  He drew the letter from his pocket and read it by the light of astanding lamp, then balled it up and threw it into the sea. "Birds andtrees?" he murmured to himself.  "We'll see about that."

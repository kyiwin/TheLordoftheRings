    Pipsqueak looked out from the shadow of Gandalf's bulk.  Hewondered if he was awake or still sleeping, still in the hazysomnambulant state in which he had spent most of the time since theirhasty departure from Edoras.  He blinked a few times, and tried torecall the events that had led to their journey.    The camp had been returning to sleep after Aragon had claimed thePalantarium as his own,  when a brief musical ringing sound suddenlyemanated from the artifact.  Gandalf leapt up, rigid with fear, hishands clenched.  "The Instant Messenger of Mordor!" he cried.  "Theconfiguration files are still there!"  Aragon, who had stooped toinvestigate the noise, stood and looked at Gandalf questioningly. Drawn by the commotion, others in the camp gathered round as well.    Gathering his wits, Gandalf ventured, "Aruman must have plantedincriminating evidence in the Palantarium when he held me captive, andgiven Sauron himself the means to reach me at will."  Observing thedubious looks of those around him, he rushed on.  "Clearly, the plotsof the traitor Aruman and his dark master run even deeper than wefeared.  Only haste will serve us now!  Wait not for the dawn!  Letthe swift not wait for the slow!  Act now, think later!  Run!"    As the startled riders and companions hastily broke camp in a routof confusion and began to speed off singly and in pairs toward Deem'sHelp, Gandalf grabbed Pipsqueak and tossed him onto Slimshade's back. "You looked into the stone, you're coming with me," he said, and thento himself, "Good insurance, too."  After a grunt as Gandalf settledon his back, Slimshade trotted off into the night.    All that had been many long days ago, and Pipsqueak was now evenmore tired and sore than after his run across Edoras with Cedric andClarence.  As he woke more fully, he heard Gandalf muttering angrilyat himself, and caught a few scattered phrases: "didn't even clear thebrowser history... buddy list... oh Eru, the bookmarks, too..."  Thewizard seemed thoroughly cross, and he wasn't making a bit of sense.    "What are you saying, Gandalf?" asked Pipsqueak.    "Eh, never you mind.  Now that you're awake, though, it's time tocontinue your education."  Pipsqueak groaned: early on their journey,Gandalf had become frustrated with his frequent questions, anddemanded, "What more do you want to know?"   Laughing, he hadanswered, "The names and numbers of all the girls in the Shire, andcheap sources for every popular drug, and the entire history ofMiddle-earth and Atlantis and the Far West.  What less?"    Gandalf had taken this as an invitation, and had entertainedhimself on their long ride by boring Pipsqueak to tears with historylessons. "Where did we leave off?" he now asked.  "I believe that I hadjust told you of the rise of the Stewards in Gondor, of Mardiland the founding of the University, and of his consolidation of thecopyrights of the Magic Kingdom, but I have not yet told you thatMardil was also known for his crusade against the rampant sexismof his time.  He it was who insisted on including a strong femalecharacter in every script to come out of Disgiliath, but perhapshis most lasting contribution to the status of women in Gondor wasthe unique system of matrilineal patrimony that he instituted withinhis own House.  Whereas the kingship had always passed from father toeldest son, Mardil declared that the Steward's eldest daughtershould select her own husband, who would then become the heir to theStewardship.  While not perfect, this system has succeeded inproviding Gondor with rulers who were able both to lead her armiesin battle and to cry during romantic dramas.  Of course, the systemreverts back to the old patrilineal arrangement in cases where thewife of the Steward produces no female offspring, as is for examplethe case with the children of Denethor's wife Lossiel.  A morecomplicated situation arose in the days of Turin I, whose wifedied childless..."    Unable to deal with Gandalf's constant drone, Pipsqueak becamedrowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of thecustoms of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had replaced theaging monorail loop through Edoras with a system of horse-drawncarriages to build ambiance and save on upkeep costs.  The wizard hadonce again driven the hobbit's conscious mind into complete withdrawal.As he fell slowly back into his zombie-like state, Pipsqueak had astrange feeling: he stood still like a great boulder by the sea, whileGandalf's words crashed over him like waves driven by a violent wind.    Later, whether one day or many he could not tell, Pipsqueak woke tofind himself surrounded by chill grey mists in the twilit hour beforedawn.  Still sitting behind him, Gandalf guided Slimshade along a wellbuilt wall of stone that loomed, barely visible, out of the mist totheir right.  Sensing that he had awakened, Gandalf said, "This is theWall of Lammas Ichor, the outer wall of Minas Tirith that wasbuilt after a goblin raid razed a harvest festival over a century ago. It was once quite ruinous and passable in some places, but it appearsthat the masons of Gondor have been busy since last I came thisway."  They pressed on, for Gandalf was in haste to find a section ofthe wall that was still in disrepair before the concealment of themorning mists was burned away.    After they had followed the wall for some time, the sound ofhurried labor could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, andthe curses of those who were nearly run down by carts rushing throughthe mist.  As they had hoped, the workers had not yet finished theirrepairs of the great wall, and a small section remained that was bothunwatched and tumbled down.  Slimshade climbed over the piles ofrubble, and his hoofbeats were lost in the sounds of construction. They passed now into the wide land beyond the Lammas Ichor, wherethey saw wide tilth, oasts, garners, folds, byres, a whole mess ofrills, and many other common sights of the countryside described inobscure, obsolete language.  After riding through the fields for overhalf an hour, a brisk wind from the river swept aside the mist, andPipsqueak beheld the polished walls and tall spires of MinasTirith for the first time.    For the fashion of Gondor's greatest city was such that itwas surrounded by seven walls, each of them higher and sturdier thanthe last, and soldiers patrolled the narrow aisles between them.Its streets and boulevards were built into the very slope of MountMinnie, easternmost outpost of the Off-White Mountains, andproperty values rose with every foot of elevation.  Turnstilesinnumerable guarded the road into the city, and in each of the sevenwalls was hung a great gate of stone: the only opening in those tallbattlements save where the abandoned monorail track passed through thewalls high above the ground.  As they watched, the first light of dawnshone forth and fell upon the peak of Mount Minnie, bathing it ingold, and glittered on the brightly painted towers that rose so highabove the Castle of Lornavaniwen that was carved out of themountain itself at the city's peak.  Everywhere Pipsqueak looked,Minas Tirith was immaculately clean, with every wall and windowsparkling in the new light of day.  A flowing trumpet call rang outfrom the distant castle, and at that signal, the seven gates of thecity swung open, welcoming visitors with the promise of Magic andWonder.    As sunlight illuminated the plain, Gandalf spurred Slimshade to hisgreatest burst of speed of the entire journey.  In a truly surprisingdisplay of dexterity and strength, the horse managed to leap fullacross the turnstiles despite the great weight of Gandalf on his back. As they charged on toward the great gates, men cried, "Mesprendeur! Mesprendeur!"  The gates, so newly opened for the day, began to swingclosed.    "Let me pass!" cried Gandalf.  "I must come to your Lord Denethor,to bring him council in this dark hour!  Vile rumors must be squelchedbefore they reach his ears!  Let me pass!"  The movers of the gatespaid no heed to his demanding voice, and the great stones swung closedwith resounding booms, but with a final burst of energy, Slimshadeproved the swifter, and Pipsqueak found himself gazing upon the heartof the Magic Kingdom of Gondor for the first time.    Slimshade's hooves echoed hollowly on the broad stone-paved path,laid out in enormous flat cobbles, all of them bright clean white andlaced with cheerful red veins; it was bordered by thin strips of well-trimmed grass.  Beyond them were stone pathways where lines could haveformed, and beyond them in turn were stone houses and attractions andsouvenir shops.  Stone flowerpots stood beside stone doorways and onstone windowsills.  Painted stone statues of giant, smiling animalsstood along the walkways.  Minas Tirith had an air of greatantiquity and permanence, yet in truth it was year by year fallinginto decay.  In every street they passed, some great entertainmenthall or gift shop was silent: empty, or even closed.  Over one greatgate, Pipsqueak read in strange and ancient characters the name "YeHynted Mynsion", but although the wide stone entrance spoke of greatcrowds and popularity, the courtyard was silent: there was no line.    "Is there no wood?" asked Pipsqueak.  "Nothing but stone?"  Helooked up at the roofs and walls and statues mounting up the hillsidebehind the gates: tiers of stone, painted or naturally multi-colored.    "There is wood here, and some metal," said Gandalf, "but there ismore stone.  The Atlanteans liked stone."    They rode on, drawing stares from the residents of the city, whowere unaccustomed to horses.  Indeed, a cleaning crew began to followthem up the street, pausing occasionally to scrub away any hoof marksand carrying buckets and shovels in case of emergencies.  At first themountainside loomed up far above the buildings that they passed, butas they went farther up the slope, the buildings grew taller andtaller and seemed to be part of the mountain themselves.  Finally,another gate rose up before them, the wall around it bending away toeither side until it joined seamlessly into the bedrock.  They wentthrough this gate, too, and entered a wide flat courtyard of polishedstone.  It was mirror white, and it blazed up fiercely in the earlysunlight.  Before them stood the Castle of Lornavaniwen.  Thesharp points of its turrets, brilliant as sapphires, pierced the skyfar above their heads, and tallest of all stood the Tower of Commerceitself, from which the Lord of the City could chart the course of hisfull domain.    As they gazed upon the castle, half a dozen guards appeared out ofhidden corners in the courtyard.  Their leader stepped forward, and ina cheerful but firm voice said, "No horses in the Citadel."  Pipsqueakand Gandalf were bundled to the ground, and before they knew what washappening, Slimshade had been led away.  Pipsqueak finally lowered hiseyes from the shining walls before him and beheld the ancient raimentof the Guards of the Citadel.    With its great age, Gondor had a keen sense of its own history,and a few customs were preserved that dated back to the Atlanteansthemselves.  The Guards of the Citadel traced their elitetradition back to the sailors of the famed Atlantean navy, and aloneamong the men of Gondor they continued to proudly wear the ancientuniform of their forebears.  That classic uniform of the Sea-Kings,worn by Anarchion himself, consisted in its entirety of a helm in thefashion of a blue sailor's cap adorned with a flowing black ribbon,and a bright blue sailor's shirt.    Gandalf strode quickly across the white-paved court, pushingPipsqueak ahead of him.  As they passed, Pipsqueak saw a high fountainoff to the side, splashing up against a great artificial tree coveredwith ladders, platforms, and ropes.  It seemed to be abandoned now, buthe could make out old signs sitting next to it: in cracking paint, oneof them read "Tarzan's Treehouse," while an almost entirely faded signset off to the side seemed to read, "Thy Swyss Fymily Rybinson".  Itlooked mournful, and quite dull, and as he ran before Gandalf hewondered why it was left in this place, where everything else was welltended.  He had absolutely no idea.    They walked down a long passage paved with marble, and as they wentGandalf spoke softly to Pipsqueak.  "Be careful of your words, MasterParagraph!  Denethor is a kind old man, if preoccupied with rulesand order.  I am of another sort, and I will not have your hobbitpertness spoiling my designs.  He will speak most to you, because ofwhat you can tell him of the fate of his beloved son Boromir, butunder cover of this he will seek to make you reveal more of my doingsthan I can afford.  Tell him no more than you must, and say nothingabout Aragon if you value your life."    At those words, Pipsqueak felt the cold point of a dagger pressinto his lower back.  "Why not?" he asked.  "Wasn't Strider planningto come here himself?  I thought he and HeyHoDen were just a few daysbehind us."    "Maybe, maybe," said Gandalf.  "Though if my messengers get throughin time, he may go off in a direction that no one expects.  It will bebetter so.  And if he does come, I want to herald his arrival myself." Gandalf halted before a tall door of carven stone, and he gave a cruelchuckle.  "See, Master Pipsqueak, I have already instructed you in thehistory of Gondor, and if you'd been paying attention you wouldunderstand the need for silence.  Do as I bid!"    With that, the door opened, and although none could be seen to openit, its motion was accompanied by a great squeaking sound that borelittle resemblance to the noise of ungreased hinges.  Pipsqueak lookedinto a great hall, lit by deep windows cut into the stone of thewalls, beyond the broad black marble pillars that upheld the highstone ceiling, carven in many forms dimly visible to those below.  Nohangings nor storied webs, nor any things of woven stuff or wood, wereto be seen in that long solemn hall; but between the pillars therestood a silent company of images graven in cold stone: figures clad inthe ancient mode of the kings, dressed as all manner of ducks, dogs,rodents, and caricatured humans of every description.    Suddenly, Pipsqueak recalled the great stone figures of theArgonath. "Boy," he whispered back to Gandalf, "these statues sure don'thold a candle to the great stone figures of the Argonath!"  Gandalf saidnothing, and simply pushed him forward.  At the far end of the hallupon a dais of many steps was set a stone chair, black and unadorned,and on it sat an old man gazing at his nearby desk.  At the foot ofthe dais, tucked back in a shadowed corner, was a high throne set withjewels and inlaid with finest gold, all of which seemed to be in needof polishing.  As they approached, the old man did not look up.  Inhis hand was a small white rod with a golden tip that he was tappingon the table in frustration.    "Hail, Denethor, Lord and Steward of Minas Tirith," saidGandalf.  "In this dark hour, I am come with..."    "With poor timing as usual," interrupted Denethor.  "Whenpreparing for war, the Stewards have spent the period from eight toeight thirty in the morning composing intelligence orders for time outof mind.  Walk-in audiences are not available until eleven.  But youwere never one to pay heed to courtesy."    Gandalf sighed quietly, and continued, "...with council and tidingsof war.  Is it naught to you that HeyHoDen has fought a great battle,and that I have broken the back of Aruman?  Is it naught to you thatslanderous rumors about me may already be spreading, rumors that haveabsolutely no basis in truth?  Is it naught to you that Isengard hasbeen overthrown and burned?"    "The burning that comes to my mind occurred the last time thatyou visited Minas Tirith,"  said Denethor.  "You have not beenwelcome here since then, and you are not welcome here now: if theGuard at the city gates had been following the established protocolsproperly, you would never have been able to enter my city in the firstplace.  As for your news, I know already enough regarding these deedsfor my own council.  Yea, for though the Stones be lost, or so theysay, still the lords of Gondor have better vision than lesser men. But as you have already interrupted my work, and as you have brought aguest whose news does interest me, we may as well push my breakfastback by thirty-five minutes.  Sit now!"    Pipsqueak settled onto the stool that was brought to him, but nevertook his eyes from the old lord.  Was it so, or had he only imaginedit, that Denethor had given him a big wink when he spoke of theStones?  Gandalf sat on the chair provided for him as well, but closeenough that Pipsqueak still felt the dagger poised and ready at hisback.    Turning to Pipsqueak, Denethor smiled sadly.  "Now, Paragraphson of Palatine, tell me of my son!  When did you last see him, andwhat was his fate?"    "How did you know my name?" Pipsqueak exclaimed, but Denethordid not answer.  After a moment, Pipsqueak began, "Boromir fellunder heavy assault by goblins and critics when our company wasscattered: he was surrounded alone, and my kinsman Moribund and I werecaptured when we tried to come to his aid."    "Tell me more!  Why was he alone, and how could such a great warriorand musician fall, with only goblins to withstand him?"    "The mightiest man may be slain by a knife in the gut," Pipsqueaksaid, "and Boromir had already received one from our mad cousinFrodo.  Perhaps if Aragon had stopped to help Boromir instead ofdashing off into the woods, things would have been..."    "AHEM," hacked Gandalf, pretending to cough violently while pressinghis dirk firmly against Pipsqueak's back.  Pipsqueak froze, and made ahorrible swallowing noise in his throat: "gollum".  He fell silent.    Denethor gave Gandalf a stern look, and turning back to Pipsqueaksaid, "Please, go on.  You have nothing to fear from me.  If it iseasier, tell me your full tale, from your first meeting withBoromir until his untimely death.  One who has risked his life formy son will always be a friend of Gondor."    Comforted, Pipsqueak told Denethor of their journey from Riven-dell, always inflating Boromir's role to better please the oldman.  As he described their flight from the house of Moira, he foundhimself explaining the conflict over the leadership of their company:"...and the contract clearly said that Aragon son of Arathon, the guywith the broken-reforged sword, was to..."    At that, Gandalf sprang up in fury.  "Why you little rat-sizedturncoat!" he cried, and he came at Pipsqueak with his blade bare. Pipsqueak squeaked in terror, and leaping up the dais threw himself atDenethor's feet.    "Little service, no doubt, will a great Lord of Men find in ahobbit, but what skills I have I offer now if you can save me from thismadman!"  Pipsqueak was quite impressed that he had managed toextemporize such a good speech, and he whipped out his sword andhanded it hilt-first to Denethor.    As the Steward took the weapon, he thrust it forward and facedGandalf in anger.  Gandalf stood at the base of the steps and staredintently into Denethor's eyes.  "What is this," asked Denethor,shaking his head in disgust, "some kind of juvenile staring contest? I had planned to house you and your companion somewhere that I couldhave you watched, but after this outrage in my own chambers I think Ishall have you taken to a cell instead.  The time of your audience is up,and the schedule of Gondor is mine to set, unless the king shouldcome again, along with a full set of authenticated proofs of ancestryand the appropriate forms filled out in triplicate."    "Unless the king should come again?" said Gandalf.  "Well, my lordSteward, I'll see what I can do about that.  The rule of no realm ismine, neither Gondor nor any other, but all things great or smallare within the realm that I consider my concern.  And if you think mejuvenile and no true man, I shall say only this.  By some chance, theblood of Atlantis runs nearly true in you, as it did in your sonBoromir, and yet does not in your other son, Dr Faramir.  For Ialso am a Steward.  Did you not know?"  And with that he turned andstrode swiftly forth from the hall, while Denethor stood rigid inshock with his face white and his mouth agape.  Pipsqueak's daggerfell from the Steward's trembling hand and clattered to the floor, andhe slowly sank back onto his lofty chair.    Minutes passed, and Denethor regained at least some of hiscomposure.  Finally recalling the presence of Pipsqueak, he said, "Iam sorry that you had to witness that, and I hope that it shall belong before you find yourself in such a tight corner between two suchterrible old men."  At that, he laughed wryly.  "I accept your offerof service, for the sake of my son, for your own protection, andbecause generous deeds should not be checked by cold companions. However, the proper paperwork must be filled out at once, and in anycase the time I had allotted for your morning audience has ended.  Youshall return to me soon to tell me of this Aragon and the rest of yourjourney, though after this morning's interruption it may provedifficult to find space in my schedule.  Now," he said, raising hisvoice and looking toward the alcoves about the hall, "who is the Guardon errand duty today?"    A man, clad in the blue sailor's cap and shirt of the Guard of theCitadel, stepped to the foot of the dais and bowed.  "I am, mylord.  Bererond son of Bararor, at your service."  Pipsqueak politelytried to avoid glancing below his waist.    Denethor nodded.  "This is Paragraph son of Palatine, whom Ihave taken into my service.  Escort him to the Registrar to completethe necessary documents and to be measured for his uniform, and teachhim the Grade II, III, V, and VIII.B. passwords.  You may then introducehim to our fair city, answer his questions, and show him to hisbarracks; be sure that he returns by the ninth hour of the evening. The Registrar will issue him temporary meal vouchers for use until hisforms are processed and his existing trademarks are assumed."  He thenturned to Pipsqueak, and returning to him his sword, said, "Farewell,my liege, and I hope to soon hear your tale in full."    Bererond led Pipsqueak to the quarters of the Guard, and after theycompleted the lengthy application and registration process they had alate lunch in one of the private "cast members only" cafeterias thatlooked out over the great stone gates of the city.  Pipsqueak learnedmuch from Bererond about Minas Tirith's culture, its nightlife,and its people, and Bererond was pleased to learn that Pipsqueak hadconnections that might be able to supply much of the Guard's need forblack market drugs and alcohol.  Beyond the stone roofs of the city,they gazed out over the tilth within the Lammas Ichor, upon thepitifully small crowd gathered to watch the cowboys performing theirtwice-daily rodeo at the Pelennor Fields, and along the long, dustyroad that led from the great gates into the south.    "That is the road to the potato vales of Tubeladen and Lotstarch,and the mountain hollows, and then on to Lebanon and the fields of thesouth," explained Bererond.  Then, in a darker tone, he went on, "FromLebanon yestereve came evil tidings of a great fleet approaching themouths of Anduin, manned by the Tampalas Bay Corsairs.  Our great fearis that this attack will inspire local riots and draw off much of thehelp that we looked to have from Lebanon and Belfast, where folk areswarthy and expendable.  All the more are we troubled by the conflictin Edoras, and the tidings of inexplicable battle that you bring."    "I am no warrior," said Pipsqueak, "and I dislike any thought ofbattle or its causes.  No stroke would have been struck in Rohan, Ithink, but for Gandalf.  But look!  What is that dust that I see inthe distance, far down the road?"    "Rightly said!" cried Bererond once he had spied the distant cloudhimself.  "The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the South Roadere sundown.  Come, let us make our way to the great gate before thecrowd forms."    Before long, they found themselves in a throng going toward theentrance to the city, filled with worried citizens of Minas Tirithwho deeply needed this boost to their morale.  When they reached thegates, Pipsqueak and Bererond spoke their names and various Grade IIIpasswords, and they were given stamps on their wrists and allowed tofind a better vantage point in the great stone-paved space beyond theturnstiles into which all the ways to Minas Tirith ran.  All eyeswere turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose as the dust kicked upby the approaching reinforcements drew nearer.    "Forlong!  Forlong!" Pipsqueak heard men calling.  "What does itmean?" he asked.    "Forlong has come," Bererond answered, "old Forlong the Fat, theLord of Lotstarch, home of my father.  Hurrah!  Here he is.  Good oldForlong!"    Out of the dust, there came walking a big, thick-limbed horse, andon it sat a big, thick-limbed man of huge girth.  He was clad in mailand wore a black helm, and he bore a long, heavy spear.  "Forlong!" menshouted.  "True heart, true friend!  Forlong!"    Behind him, the dust settled.    The onlookers stood silent for a while.  The wind had died, and theevening was heavy, and for some this made the shock of disappointmenttoo much to bear: first one, and then another of the onlookers satdown where he was and began to cry quietly.  Eventually, the crowdbegan to wander listlessly back into the city, though it seemed thatsome crept instead away toward Minas Minnie and the hills.Pipsqueak thought he heard one of these men mutter, "Gondor shall notperish yet!  Hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valleywhere the grass is green... and I'm gonna get there while the gettin'sgood."    As they trudged back up to the barracks, Pipsqueak and Bererondwere silent, each lost in his own thoughts.  Bererond showed him to hisnewly assigned bunk.  "It is a black night," he said, "and the end ofa black day.  We can only hope that things will look brighter in themorning.  Wake early, for you will be summoned before the second hourto the Lord Denethor to receive your permanent assignment with theGuard.  Farewell, and sleep in peace!"    The barracks were dark as Pipsqueak climbed into his bed to settlein for the evening.  Gloom settled still more heavily on him, for hewas alone in a strange city and was soon to be thrust into the terribleheat of war.  For a while he lay and listened to the sounds of theother Guards breathing and tossing in their sleep, and then he joinedthem in their uneasy slumber.    In the night he was wakened by a dim light above him: Gandalf hadcome and was leaning over the bed with a pillow poised above Pipsqueak'sface.  "I have come for you here," said the wizard in an almostinaudible whisper, "for I must have a little peace to work in thiscity, alone.  I cannot leave you to do any more damage than you havealready done.  I hope you have enjoyed this night, Paragraph Took! There will be no dawn."
  Isen riverrun, past HeyHoDen, son of Thengel, son of Fengel, son ofFolcwine, son of Folca, son of Walda, relative of Fluffy, and his nephewEonard, canard sans cojones, unpuissant in battle, at the sight of arrowrainfrom bow an iceclad shiverer, merest of bantlings, and his niece Eowynn,blonde and nubile and never been kissed in the grass ho ho;  now wondering what to do to get rid of his gluttonous guest Aragon as thecompany rode south from the ruin of Isengard, musing how his longfather Yorl(Mercy an his mummery!) Offa'ed the Orcs at the point of time when they wereabout to overprune their eeniemice in Minas Mickey, his thoughts perkelatingthrough his brain in slow curses and screams when a Rider galloped up fromthe rear of their line.  "My lord," he said to the king, "there are horsemen behind us. As wepassed the Fords I thought that  I heard them. Now we are sure. They areovertaking us, riding hard."  "If we can aFord the Isen, so can they," mused the king(ababbababbarubbalubbafubbaoutoifideasyougulliblesassenachfool), and hecommanded everybody to wait. But their pursuers were merely some thirty orso of Aragon's kinsmen from the north, led by one herosuiticalAtlantidiniophobet yclept Halberd; and with them also rode the sons of ElRond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, thirsting to revenge their mother (whose namewas a matter of debate) for her long, slow torment in the concert halls ofthe Orcs as they forced her to listen to the works of Hindemuzgash,Mahlerhúr and Smaughausen. Everybody in the company was gay at the meeting,and the king reJoyced at the news of who they were.  "Now that you have your own outfit, I suppose you will ride your separateway?" he said to Aragon.  "Indeed I am," responded Aragon. "I know you will dawdle here for quitesome time under the pretext of mustering your Riders; but I am in a hurryand will take the Paths of the Living."  "Really?" inquired HeyHoDen with raised eyebrows. "Are you sure that is agood idea?"  "The best," answered Aragon firmly.  "Well, have it your own way," said HeyHoDen. "But do ride with us toDeem's Help first for a barbecue. We will see you off in style."  "Thank you, lord; you are most gracious," drooled Aragon.  "Perhaps we will meet again," said Eonard without much enthusiasm.  "We may," said Aragon.  So they arrived at Deem's Help, and the Dunlendish slaves fried hamburgersfor their betters, who while waiting to get served watched the highly exoticdancing of a dusky beauty from Harad called Ostrich Flame.  When the food was served, Aragon devoured it and asked for more whilecomplaining of the poor fare. "What I wouldn't do for a proper tikkamasala!" he groaned as he wolfed down his tenth cheeseburger.  "What are the Paths of the Living?" asked Giggly with his eyes avertedfrom the gross sight of the slavering, chomping Aragon.   "Thus spoke Malcolm the Seer, in the days of Ar-vegetal, last king ofFornost," said Aragon:    The statue's nose has a round black tip,    and westward points its four-fingered hand.    The Tower trembles; to the amusement parks    mice are approaching. The ducks awaken;    for the hour is come for the cartoon creatures;    at the Stone of Elmer they shall stand again.    and hear quacks of a bird in the hills raging    Who shall awake them? Who shall call them    from the grey twilight, the forgotten people?    The heir of him to whom the franchise was given.    From the North he shall come, greed shall drive him:    He shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Living  "And what paths are those?" asked Lego-lass.  "Simply a shortcut thrugh the Off-white Mountains that the Rohirrim avoidbecause they find the toll excessive," answered Aragon. "But Elendil's Heirtravels there for free."  "Hey, cool!" said Giggly. "Look, one of Isildur's original collaboratorswas a Dwarf called Harry Cohn. I am collaterally descended from him. Can Ihave a cut?"  "Surely," said Aragon. "No show is complete without a Dwarf."  After the meal, HeyHoDen summoned the pathetic, ragtag Rohan peasant army.Grouching "What is it now?" "My arse is sore from the saddle!" and thelike, they reluctantly shuffled closer and formed ragged lines. HeyHoDenlooked keenly on them, and with a slight, wry smile he said:  "The people of Rohan were always numerous, but ofttimes their bravery hasbeen less impressive than their numbers. However, to encourage you I haveretained a few Orkish whipmen, who by joining our side have proved that allOrcs are not evil, despite racist claims to that effect. Húberz, Húmfrkh,Snagfred - keep an eye on them! Where there is a whip there is a will."  A number of Orkish overseers in public school uniforms walked forward andsaluted the king with their whips.  "Together we shall attain glory!" shouted HeyHoDen with glaring, insaneeyes. "The victory and the power shall go to Minowara blood, Minnehahablood, Minotaur bood! Oh, Aragon-san, what a future I have planned for you!"Suddenly, HeyHoDen's red, glazed eyes focused. He shook his head, lookingslightly embarrassed.  "Sorry about that," he said. "But that pipeweed the halflings taught me tosmoke really is good stuff."  And now Aragon sat up on his great big harse. But lo! His massive weight,augmented by unnumbered hamburgers and Frankfurter sausages, was too muchfor his steed; its legs folded like boiled spaghetti and it hit the groundwith a crash, instantly killed by the oppressive weight on its back. A moanof despair arose from the Rohirrim, whose larders were already depletedbecause of this man.  "How fortunate that I can amend this!" said HeyHoDen with a tight smile."I received a gift from Denethor last year and have kept it stabled here atDeem's Help for the fertilizer." At a sign from him, two servants ran offand returned with a huge mûmak.  "This is Babar, named for the fabled oliphaunt king of old," declaredHeyHoDen, "and this is my parting gift to you. May it carry you far!"  Aragon bowed and sat up. For a moment the mûmak reeled under his weight,but it recovered. Its small eyes looked unhappy, but apart from a bit ofear-flapping it did not object to the inhumane treatment it was beingsubjected to.  Now everybody took an enthusiastic farewell of the company. The field wasfull of people waving good-bye: Rohirrim, Dunlendings drafted into the Rohanarmy on an affirmative action quota programme they would gladly haveabstained from, Ments, Ents, Ments disguised as Orcs, Orcs disguised asMents, Ments disguised as Ents - everybody cheered at the company'sdeparture, and indeed, grateful they were to be rid of someone with Aragon'sinsatiable appetite ("another week and he would have eaten me out of mykingdom!" sighed HeyHoDen to Eonard).  And while HeyHoDen went by slow paths in the hills, the Gay Company passedswiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came toEdoras, where Aragon had a spot of trouble persuading Eowynn not to jointhem. However, the welding torch-like glare from Arwen's eyes clearly showedthat this was the politic thing to do.  "Fear not, sugarpuss," whispered Aragon to Eowynn when Arwen happened tolook away for a moment. "When this is over I will make you a greater starthan Shelob herself, for I mean to restore the Gondor entertainmentindustry to its old glory." Eowynn bit her lip and stared sourly at theground, but she had to rest content with this promise.  When the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risenabove the high ridges in the East, Aragon made ready to depart. He and thosewith him rode away without anyone bidding them farewell, for Eowynn wassulking in her rooms and her folk did not wish to encourage any furthertardiness from their guests. (Aragon's evening meal and breakfast hadconsumed all the food they had meant to bring to their wartime refuge in thehills.)  So they came to the Door to the Paths of the Living. Above its wide archwas a rim of merrily shining red lightbulbs, and jazz music flowed from itlike the screaming of tortured Nazdaq.  "This is a tasteless door," said Halberd, "and I hate jazz music. I willpass it nonetheless; but does anyone have earstoppers?"  No one did. They entered on a file, leading their horses. (The mûmak Babarlet out a huge gust of relief as Aragon sat down from it, and meeklyfollowed him under the arch.) An aged ticket collector ambled forwards, butlooking at Aragon he fell back again and saluted him by snapping his fingersand doing a moonwalk. Aragon had brought torches from Edoras, and now hewent ahead bearing one aloft; and Al Ladan with another went at the rear,and beside him walked Giggly and Lego-lass, rubbernecking. Most of theattractions (apart from a few nightclubs and gambling dens) were closeddown, but the magic of the place had kept them spotless and shining; theylooked as if they could open at any moment and take admission fees forvisiting Queen Berúthiel's Tea Party, Bottle and the Booze or Cindy Reela'sgingerbread house.  No barker accosted the company, nor withstood their passage, and yetsteadily grew the curiosity of the Dwarf as he went on, most of all becausehe itched to learn how many marks the various outfits had fleeced on anormal business day. So time unreckoned passed, until Giggly beheld a mostcurious sight. The road was wide, but now the company came suddenly into agreat empty space, and there were no longer  any walls upon either side. Thegreed was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk onwards. Away to theleft something glittered in the gloom as Aragon's torch drew near. ThenAragon halted and went to look what it might be. Giggly, who smelled gold,followed him at once, and Lego-lass trailed after him.  Aragon kneeled while Al Ladan held aloft both torches. Arwen crossed herarms and gazed at it all with a sort of amused disdain. Before them were thebones of a mighty man. He had been clad in mail, and still his harness laythere whole; but his shoulders and head were in little pieces that seemed tobe slowly growing together. As Giggly watched, two bits of throat meltedtogether with a small hissing sound.  "This looks like Boromir," said Aragon thoughtfully. "He must have beenbrought here by some kind of tremendous explosion, transmitted here throughspace and time."  "That sounds very far-fetched," remarked Giggly.  "Not at all!" declared Aragon. "Fredric Brown uses precisely that idea ina science fiction story of his called 'What Mad Universe'  a gloriousread!"  "Do you like science fiction?" exclaimed Giggly; a smouldering fire was inhis eyes. "I had no idea! I like Brown, but I prefer Clifford Simak and PoulAnderson."  "I am more of the hardscience Asimov or Heinlein school," said Aragon."Have you read the Foundation trilogy?"  "My lord Aragon, please!" objected Halberd. "This is hardly the place forthis kind of discussion, is it?" Aragon and Giggly looked at each other.  "I suppose not," said Aragon with a sigh. "But had I but known this duringall those boring evenings... well, let's look at Boromir. All the pieces seemto have grown together now."  "He was in one piece when we last saw him," remarked Lego-lass.  "True. True," said Aragon with a sligtly shifty look. "Well, let's turnhim over." He did so and exclaimed: "He has no face!"  "And it does not look as if it's going to grow back," remarked Giggly,peeking through Aragon's armpit. "I wonder why?"  "Perhaps it got stuck somewhere," said Aragon. "But never mind! Rememberthat 'the hands of the King are the hands of a healer'! We'll bring him backto life and give him a new face."  "Can we really do that?" asked Giggly.  "Oh, definitely! These are the Paths of the Living. Open that door behindhim, Halberd."  Halberd obeyed his command. The two men entered the room behind andreturned, wheeling and carrying various items of medical apparatus. Togetherwith Giggly and Lego-lass they donned surgical clothing that Giggly hadfound, placed Boromir on a bed with castor wheels and assembled around it.After a brief fight over the scalpels between Arwen and Lego-lass they wereall set.  "Give him 40 cc of Nauglamirin!" commanded Aragon. Halberd obeyed.  "Give him 220 volts!" Giggly stepped forward and sadistically applied theshock.  "He is breathing!" reported Lego-lass.  "Ready to electrocute his penis," said Aragon.  "Pardon?" said Giggly.  "Oh... ah... er.., I mean 'Ready to intubate'," said Aragon with a slightblush.  After twenty minutes of hard work Boromir was alive and breathing, andwould no doubt have had rosy cheeks if he had been in possession of a face.  "And now for a face!" said Aragon merrily. "Behold, I am the renewer!" Heplaced both hands on Boromir's head and kneaded it until a howl suddenlyburst from the recumbent warrior. Aragon snatched back his hands andexclaimed: "Behold my handiwork!"  The others looked and gasped. Boromir had indeed received a new face. Ithad a long nose with a round black knob at its end; huge upper teethprotuded from his mouth, and he had long, hanging black ears. He also seemedto have acquired a blue cap that rose from his crown like a little tower.  "I will restore Minas Tirith to its ancient glory, such as it was when itwas known as Minas Mickey and faced Minas Goofy across the River!" declaredAragon. "And who better to start with than the beloved son of StewardDenethor?" He laughed aloud, a laughter with certain sinister overtones:"Hnyukyukyuk!" The others stared, frozen with shock. Even Giggly, thegreediest of Dwarves and hardened by many shady deals, was taken aback.  Arwen sucked in her breath with a soft hiss. "Aren't you going a bit toofar?" she whispered to Aragon. He looked innocently at her and then winked.  Boromir opened his eyes and asked: "Where am I?"  Halberd licked his lips. "In the Paths of the Living," he said.  "Is my face here too?" asked Boromir. "I seemed to lose it  but no, itwas just an evil dream."  "You have got a new face," said Halberd in a choked voice. He polished hisshield with his sleeve and held it up as a mirror before Boromir, wholooked at the reflection.  "GAWRSH!" he exclaimed. They all waited, Aragon expressionless but theothers in some trepidation. Boromir looked intently at his reflection andmade a deep, clunking sound in his throat.  "I like it!" he declared. They all breathed out, except Aragon, who smiledand discreetly put away a knife he had been holding.  "This is but a token of things to come!" he said. "Soon we will be out ofthe passage. Lead the way, friend Boromir!"  Soon they were indeed out of the tunnel and came into the clear friendlysunshine. They marched onwards, accompanied by an ever growing flock ofcheering funlovers. At the head of the Gay Company danced Boromir, singing:  Aragon, Arathon's son, riding on Babar!  Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee!Seated on his only slightly groaning mûmak, Aragon threw chocolate coins tothe multitude, who fell on their knees in the dust exclaiming "He'sgenerous! So generous!" Wherever they came the enemies of Gondor screamedand fled, for they worshipped film noir and other black arts, but the commonpeople gathered around the Gay Company, and joy and merriment followed them.

It's so simple that even a MORON could figure it out.Eonard (wrestling with map while the army looks on, confused):  Gosh darn it,does ANYONE know to fold this thing back up?HeyHoDen: (dead-pan, to camera) At least we know he's no moron.--------------------------------------------------Scene 2: A Long-Expected Party Line[While HeyHoDen and Eonard ride towards Dunhero at the head of the army, Morriefollows closely behind, talking incessantly, filling King HeyHoDen's ears withtales of his rebellious hobbit youth -- his nightly soirees of cow-tipping, ofegging Farmer Maggot's house, of spray-painting "Fatty Bolger Lives" on thesides of the mill as the sheriff hallooed and hallayed after them.]Morrie: (chortling) ...And THEN there was the time I stole some of Gandalf'sfireworks, drained out the powder, and stuffed it all into the bowl of the OldGaffer's pipe!

Our hunchbacked groundskeeper insists oncutting them, though, and because it keeps him from eating live gophers out onthe ninth green, we tolerate it.

But while some facilities cater only to the rich andfamous, here at Dunhero, we don't take anyone but the very best -- even ifthey're Maiar in disguise![Both men turn and smile cheesily into the camera.]Alatar: (speaking to camera) Hi! I'm Alatar!Pallandro: And I'm Pallandro. While we made the cut, our friend Olorin -- orGandalf -- bombed out big-time.Alatar: He was plain bad.Eonard: (off-camera) What? Gandalf's evil?Alatar: (whacking Eonard off-camera with his staff) No, young fool, just bad. Aterrible wizard. No stage presence, couldn't do a trick to save his life.Pallandro: (nodding) Always dropping his marked deck, or sneezing from rabbitspoor left in his hat, or forgetting the magic words of power.Eonard: (off-camera) What words? Alakazam? Hocus pocus? Elbereth Githoniel?Pallandro: No, "Cash in Advance," dolt. (He whacks Eonard on the headoff-camera, then sighs.) But he only has himself to blame. After flubbing theold "Saw the Elf Maiden in Half" trick down in a Lothlorien nightclub, he lostmost of his bookings. Poor Lustianne just fell to pieces...[There are loud gasps from off-camera.]Eonard: But we thought she died of grief over Bluto's death, from theslipcasts!Alatar: (whacking Eonard on the head again off-camera) Oh, Olorin's changed hisstory AGAIN, has he?Pallandro: For centuries, it was, "She just stepped out for a smoke, officer,and then I just found her like this in the parking lot." What audacity.Alatar: The old goat. He tried to steal my peanuts on the flight over from theBlessed Realms too, you know, while I was in the lavatory. And when we playedpoker, he would always bid things like, "Ruling the world," or "Making cookiesout of Girl Scouts." Don't trust Olorin any farther than you can throw him,unless you're throwing him into the Cracks of Doom.Pallandro: I never understood what Sauron saw in him anyway.Alatar: That degree from Cambridge, no doubt. It impresses everyone.Eonard: (off-camera) SAURON??! The BURNING EYE of MORDOR?Pallandro: (whacking Eonard on the head with his staff) What is this moviebecoming, a commercial for organic food?Alatar (to Pallandro): Well, it's quite good -- the Burning Eye eggs are whatgot me hooked, remember?Pallandro: I was always partial to his fresh produce. But at least he's done alot for agriculture in Mordor.Eonard: (off-camera) What? Mordor's all desert! Wasteland! Parking lots!Alatar: (whacking Eonard on the head off-camera) Only from years of Gondor'smine-stripping the countryside. Rainforests take some time to spring back. Eonard: (off-camera) Sauron is trying to conquer Middle-Earth and enslave itspeople!! Uncle, tell them!HeyHoDen's (off-camera): Hey, I never met the guy.Alatar: Sauron was the nicest young lad.Pallandro: Worked in his garden all day, bare-footed, piling weeds for compost.When Galadriel Seeds, Inc., took off a few years back, he wrestled with usingpesticides or artificial fertilizer but never gave in, as he was concernedabout the effects on the water table and food chain.Eonard: (stepping on camera, with two black eyes) Look, can you just turn thatthing OFF? (He faces the old wizards.) We're talking about Sauron here.SAUR-on! Destroyer of Middle-Earth. Kicker of Puppies. Writer of Parodies.Thawer of Ice Cream. Eater of Babies.Alatar (to Pallandro): I hear he's a vegetarian now.Pallandro: I believe it. If there's one thing you can say about Sauron, it'sthat he can't stand to see anyone suffer.[There's a stunned pause as Eonard's pupils dilate and drool drips down hischin. Then both men begin cackling insanely.]Pallandro: (unable to breathe from laughter) Hee hee! Just kidding!Alatar: What a look on the kid's face! It gets them every time!Pallandro: "Vegetarian!" Oh PLEASE...!Alatar: I thought the mine-stripping was a beautiful touch, myself...Dunfore: (overdub) When your old men start acting funny, don't send them downthe Anduin in a flaming boat without oars -- send them to Dunhero!

The door slams shut.]Eonard: But she said she was going to the mall, to mock those who had lessmoney and less expensive designer clothing! Like, sure!HeyHoDen (pounding on door): Come out of there! Come out of there at once,young lady!Eowynifred (muffled): No!HeyHoDen: You're making a fool of yourself on the Usenet!Eowynifred: I don't care!HeyHoDen: That's it! You're grounded!

And forbidden tosee Wormtongue ever again!Eowynifred: BUT I LOVE HIM FATHER![big pause as everyone looks at each other]HeyHoDen: (sheepishly) By Eorl's golden chamberpot, I have no clue how torespond to THAT one.--------------------------------------------COMMERCIAL: Dwarf Acrobatic TeamDunfore (overdubbed): Here at Dunhero , we're not just any old retirement home.There's always things to do and new skills to learn, even if you're as old asEl Rond without a face lift![Block letters on screen: DWARF ACROBATIC TEAM]Dunfore: Most long-bearded dwarves take up rappelling, but why limit yourself?[Camera cuts to eight wrinkled dwarves who dive and roll around the gymnasium,wearing spandex shorts and tank tops, to the throbbing beat of Boy George's"I'll Tumble For You."]All Dwarves: Hi! Ho! Yippee-Hi-Ho![One at a time, each somersaults by the eye of the camera as way ofintroduction, then vaults up into a precarious pyramid formation.]Dwarf 1: I'm Balin!Dwarf 2: And Ori!Dwarf 3: Oin!Dwarf 4: Thror!Dwarf 5: Durin!Dwarf 6: He's Gropey!Dwarf 7: He's Dumpy!Dwarf 8: And I'm Percival!All Dwarves: And We! Are! The Dwarf Acrobatic Team![They hold the formation for all of three seconds before Ori farts, then rollsover convulsing in laughter. The pyramid collapses.]Balin: Okay. Break for ten.[Dwarves grab towels, six-packs of Michelob, and Cuban cigars, and head for thesauna.]HeyHoDen: (sounding very much like he's reading from a cue card) As King ofRohan and a perennial lover of horses, I must say that I respect the talents ofthese skilled performers --Eonard (off-camera): But Uncle, didn't you used to say that dwarves tumble bestwhen pushed off a high cliff?HeyHoDen (whacking Eonard off-camera with flat of sword): -- and I look forwardto the many recreational activities that Dunhero has to offer old fogies likeme.Dunhero: When your hero days are done, be a zero just for fun.---------------------------------Scene 7: Everyone All Caught Up[With tempers cooled, Morrie locked in Day Care, the lovers out of the closet,Wormtongue duct-taped to the futon, Eonard making himself a Burning Eyeegg-cram-liverwurst sandwich, no more infomercials being filmed, and HeyHoDenwondering why it was so hard to fake his own death like everyone else andretire secretly in peace, everyone spent some time catching up.]Eowynifred: (repeated for the fiftieth time, as she brushes her hair and fixesher smudged makeup) But are you SURE he's DEAD?HeyHoDen: (crossing his fingers) Yes.Eonard: But that makes no sense, the Door didn't lead to the Paths of the DEAD,it led to the Paths of the LIVING --HeyHoDen: Silence, varlot, he is DEAD DEAD DEAD! [The bathroom door opens, and out comes Thror of the Dwarf Acrobatic Team,wrapped in a towel.]Thror: (gruffly) Hope you don't mind, but I borrowed your nail clippers to trimmy eyebrows. By the way, someone left this on your pillow.[He hands HeyHoDen a small card that says, simply, "No, he's not, he's ALIVE!"]Eonard: (curious) Didn't that come with any chocolates or mints or something?The maid's supposed to leave chocolates or mints.[Thror belches loudly in Eonard's face in response, then goes back into thebathroom.]HeyHoDen: (tossing the card in the trash so no one can see it) If old talesspeak truly, none have ventured the Paths of the Living since Balderdash, sonof Brillo, was thrown through that Door and had it barred and mortared shutbehind him, to never be seen among men again -- not even after electionofficials removed that seal eighty years later to hide ballots from Palm Beachwithin its dark tunnels.Eowynifred: Then why would Aragon even go that way?Wormtongue: (still tied up) To win the election for Al Gore?Eonard: No one knows the purposes of the insane.Eowynifred: (bitter) Greatly changed was that man since last I saw him in theKing's house -- a pathetic fool, lost in delusions of grandeur, unable toaccept the honest love of a passionate, intelligent, beautiful woman with goodhair, one who loved him desperately and would have done anything he wanted,literally ANYTHING, if only he would have taken her within his strong armsand... [She trails away as she realizes everyone else is staring at her.]Eowynifred (waving a fist in the direction of the Door): FIE ON THEE, mayestthou rot in the depths of HELL forever for thy scorn! Err, I really mean that.[There is a long pause.]Wormtongue: So you were just using me. Eowynifred: (nodding) Yeah. Yeah, you were my rebound. Are you angry?Wormtongue (after a very long pause):  Well, as long as we're on the same page,how about one more rebound for the --HeyHoDen: (interrrupting) While my heart tells me loudly that we won't beseeing anything of Lord Aragon again, yet he was kingly, and knew how to lordit like a king over us! So take comfort in this tale, DAUGHTER..It is said that when Brillo and Balderdash had climbed the stair to the Door,upon its threshold sat a man begging for cigarettes and cheap whiskey, agedbeyond years -- once tall and strong but now as withered as Jesse Helms, andjust as fit to retire.And this man looked as gray as week-old tuna and said no word until they triedto pass him and enter, and then a voice came from him, and it was the voice ofBarry White but with a semi-passable Scottish brogue, and it said, 'This wayyou shall not pass, ach, yes, not unless you tell me what I've got in mypockets.'And so they halted and stared, and they saw that he was an eccentric old manwith tobacco-stained teeth and a face like a smelt."Hands!" exclaimed Balderdash, which the old man had just wisely slipped outbefore he could be caught by such a foolish answer."'The way is shut," repeated the old man, "and so shall its secrets be hiddenuntil the riddle is answered.'Resigning himself to having to slip the man a ten-note to find out somethinguseful, Brillo replied, "So, when will that time be?"But no answer did he get, for the old man suddenly died and toppled forwardwith Balderdash's dagger within his back, and then they searched his pocketsand found nothing but a pocketknife and some old string, which wasn't what hehad led them to believe with his riddle, but there was nothing to be done aboutit at that point except prop him back up against the rock and pretend thatnothing had happened at all.Wormtongue: (curiously) You know, that reminds me a great deal of what happenedto old man Marley, the polo bookie, back at Meduseld last year --Eonard: (a bit too quickly) Alas, that such fey moods fall upon kings in theirhour of need! Wormtongue: But --Eonard: Shut UP. I never liked you anyway.Wormtongue: Look, I realize you've always hated me because I'm smarter than youand because I know where your sister's bikini lines stop --Eonard: YARG!Wormtongue: -- but I'm really a neat person.Eonard: And what does that mean? You've learned how to fold your own laundryand put it away?Wormtongue: I've never been thrown from a horse.Eonard: And never eaten one, either, I'll bet.Wormtongue: But I've read all sorts of books and know all kinds of usefulthings!Eonard: Except whether or not elves have pointy ears and balrogs actually havewingsWormtongue: I can show you how to figure out who's going to win the secondseason of Big Brother.Eonard: Who cares?Wormtongue: (lowering his voice) I can tell you how to become king in less thana week.Eonard: (one eye flickering over to HeyHoDen) Okay, I'm listening. [As Eonard pulls up a chair, suddenly from outside is a loud sound.]HeyHoDen: Hark! What is THAT loud sound?Balin: (shouted from bathroom) Might be room service -- we've got steaks andsuds comin'!Eowynifred: No, look, there! Outside! A mob!HeyHoDen: Well, give Gandalf a wedgie, it IS a mob. (Looks at watch) And righton time! (Throws open shutters) Greetings, pigs, err, loyal subjects! Art thouprepared to leave?[There's the staccato sound of projectiles hitting the wall, and an arrowsuddenly shishkabobs Wormtongue through the head, just like the old SteveMartin schtick.]Wormtongue: Ouch.HeyHoDen: (slamming the window) Perhaps they'd like to stay the night?Eowynifred: (peering through glass) No doubt the peasants are angry that we'vehad our cake and eaten theirs too. They seem mostly focused on the sodamachines and the Hostess truck parked behind the kitchen. Perhaps while theytry to eat their way through tons of tempered steel in their insatiable questfor food, we could flee!HeyHoDen: (glancing at Wormtongue) I cannot argue, for there 'tis the Red Arrowsticking through my ex-counselor's head, and when the Red Arrow appears inRohan, it has long been our tradition, from my father and his father beforehim, to ride like hell out of there. So to Gondor, and away! Ride!Eonard: But uncle, we cannot go to Gondor, Lord Denethor expects us with anarmy! We have no army now!HeyHoDen: (peeking back out through the window at the mob) How about the onethat might be right on our heels?Eonard: Uncle!HeyHoDen: (deciding) Lord Balin, would you care to join the heroes of Rohan forone last quest to rid Middle-Earth of evil and thus allow future generations ofdwarves and Rohanese to meet together upon the field of battle and knock eachother senseless for the rights to deforest Fangorn's green woods?Balin: Look, HeyHoDen, I like you and all, and you've got a decent beard for ahuman, but the "Fighting the Dark Lord" thing doesn't cut it anymore. Just notfulfilling. I'm retired, and life is too short to be wasted on such joylesspursuits.HeyHoDen (slyly): There's gold involved. Lots of it.Eonard: But Uncle, the royal treasury has been emptied -- (HeyHoDen slaps himalongside the head) -- err, for spring cleaning.HeyHoDen: With the Gondor army distracted by Nazgul lords and the assault onthe main gate, I'd bet a seasoned contingent of dwarves could bust through theranks and plunder most of the High Court before anyone caught on.[Big pause as the dwarves look amongst themselves. Then they break into song.]Dwarves: We ride! Ho! Kill the men, kill the elves, save the gold forourselves! HeyHoDen, let's go!Eonard: But Uncle, I thought we were friends with the Stewards of Gondor. HeyHoDen: Years ago, they whipped us in the Pinewood Derby, son. Now it'spayback time.[And so, away from the burning food courts and landing pads of Dunhero, wherethe soiled and starved faces of the peasantry looked out from their sewerholes, on horseback and in stolen golf carts, King HeyHoDen, his nephew, thedazed ex-counselor, and the Dwarf Acrobatic Team did ride towards Gondor, theCity of Gold, and without horn or harp or any real semblance of melodic refrainor consistent tempo did break into this very song!]     To Dunhero came our done hero     to set up house and fake his death     To hang the horse, kick off the boots     and enjoy his retirement!     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     The great escape is sure to chaff     his skin as he to Gondor rides!     Raw knees! (Raw knees!)     Raw knees! (Oh please!)     The peasants eat the rocks and trees     as HeyHoDen to Gondor flees!     He cannot leave his friend to smolder     nor give Gondor to its foe!     With dwarves balanced on head and shoulder,     HeyHoDen rides to save the gold!     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     Rawhide! (Rawhide!)     His long rapport with Denethor     demands he ride to watch him die      Rawdeal! (Rawdeal!)     Rawdeal! (Rawdeal!)     Dreams of revenge are soon to hinge     on dwarf gymnastics far afield!     Rawfish! (Rawfish!)     Raw --PRODUCER: CUT! CUT! WE LOST OUR LEASE! SHUT IT DOWN! SHUT IT *ALL* DOWN!Writer: But --Producer: Sorry. You there, throw out those stale Twinkies; this picture's awrap.Writer: (whining) But it's not done! We have three more pages to go and RichardDreyfuss is still in day care --[Doors slam. Lights go out. Crickets chirp. All that is left is a bare table, anumber #2 pencil, an Olympia typewriter, and a spittoon. The writer sighs andsits at the table, then types out the last pages of narrative, this time innovel form.]LAST SCENE: HOW MORIBUND CAN YOU GET?Morrie had quickly tired of day care and of the large diapers he had beenforced to wear, and although the teachers would toss him small bits of crackerand gumdrops if he would but gurgle and coo and stick plastic keys deep intohis mouth, he soon felt quite sick to his stomach."They have all left now," he grumbled. "Gandalf and Pipsqueak, Frodo and Sam,HeyHoDen and Eonard, even the audience! And my turn will come soon enough, if Iam continued to be fed so poorly. What I need now is some REAL grub."And so Morrie killed all of the day care staff, traumatized the children byflushing their Rugrats dolls down the toilet, then found his way into thekitchens and larders of the facility, looking for a nice mincemeat pie or somecarrot-whisky crème brulee to satisfy his terrible hunger for solid food.But the refrigerator only contained mashed bananas and stewed peas, and bottleafter bottle of Zantac and Metamucil. "Holy Fatty Bolger Stuck in a Tub of Apple Butter!" Morrie thought to himself."They're planning to give HeyHoDen heartburn and incontinence all at once! Imust warn the King immediately!"But as the hobbit slipped from the refrigerator to the floor and ambled pastthe trashcan, he paused and sniffed. Then sniffed again, with all the olfactorysense of a desperately hungry hobbit."Bless my stars and garters," he announced, "there's a half-eaten éclairsomewhere in that trash bag!"Remembering what had happened to George in an early episode of Seinfeld, butlooking around and seeing no one, he scrambled up and over the side of the bag,and disappeared like a grub worm into its depths, eating his way to the bottomand thus to the elusive pastry.While the barrel rocked and swayed, the door opened and Otto the groundskeepershuffled into the room. He was already tired from cleaning up after the DwarfAcrobatic Team, which had sprayed beer around most of the hallways as some sortof hazing ritual, and most of the mops in his janitorial closet had beenmysterious broken as if in the throes of passion. Now there was trash to dumpbefore his day's work was complete and he could retire to the golf course inorder to gopher some grub. His hunchback straining, Otto did not even notice the small thrashing shape atthe bottom of the Hefty garbage bag (which was made for trolls -- so tough itcould hold ten hobbits and more besides!) nor the impending plot twist'ssimilarity to the scene with Veruca Salt in "Willy Wonka and the ChocolateFactory.""Ooof!" said Otto, dumping the bag down the chute."Aiiiiiii!" said the bag as it disappeared down the hatch."Whoomph!" said the incinerator as the bag hit the furnace, spelling an end tomost of Morrie's pointless angst, depression, and lack of identity in theentire series, and ensuring that, out of the nine walkers of the fellowship, atleast one of them would taste the equivalent of the flames of the Crack of Doomsince even Boromir had already come back from the dead -- albeit with a bit ofcosmetic surgery.Scratching his head, Otto found Morrie's discarded "I'm One Bad Hobbit" buttonand, liking the sparkly colors, pinned it on his cardigan and wandered outside-- where he was rudely intercepted by a gray-cloaked rider mounted on achugging Harley, who smiled grimly in recognition at the sight of his button. "Come, Morrie!" cried the rider, who definitely resembled the pretty blondechick who was always in his way every time Otto went into the janitorialclosets looking for toilet cleaner but now insisted that her name was Dirtheadrather than Eowynifred."Aragon is alive!" s/he continued, gray eyes flashing. "He who has scorned me,and yet still lives! Well, that misfortune must be remedied! Come to MinasTirith with me, Morrie, and we shall have our revenge! Wa ha ha! Wa ha ha! Waha ha!"Otto stared at her in confusion, but once the writer whispered in his ear andtold him that someone had to carry on for poor departed Morrie, the confusioncleared. (AUTHOR NOTE: Due to budget constraints, the part of Morrie Brandybuck will nowbe played by a big, dopey, grotesque, mostly bald hunchback.)"Okeedokily!" said Otto, leaping upon the back of the Harley with a screech ofstrained metal."Oh, Morrie, you've been picking again, haven't you?" noted Dirthead. "Stickthose 'ten days to thin thighs' and you'll feel much better. You know trollsonly eat chubby hobbits, they throw the rest back.""Burp," agreed Otto.***And so it came to pass that when the King himself had set out, behind themysterious Dirthead hunched Otto the mutant groundskeeper, sitting in for poordeparted Morrie who had never stood a chance anyway, and the great bike namedWinnebago spluttered under the great burden but did not stop, for it knew thatits engine would be throttled if it did not get Dirthead to Gondor in order toslay the breaker of her heart, the Lord Aragon, if indeed he still lived atall.And all of the story became chaotic and bewildering; and ever the confusiondeepened before them; and irony continued to dog their paths. Selah.

But first, we turnto our weather correspondent, Súriel Gwildol![Weather correspondent appears.  She looks much like Anchor 1, exceptwith poofier hair.]Weather C.: Thanks, Sar!  Well, have we got weather tonight!  Muggy andsticky tonight, with no chance of rain, but we've got another warmfront moving in from the east, carrying a huge bank of clouds fromMount Viagra.  Wonder what's cooking out there, huh?  Moms, better takeyour washing in early 'cause we might get a little ash falling out fromthose clouds, though it looks as if all that air is going to be liftedup over the cooler air this side of Anduin.  The current temperature isjust above freezing, with highs later on today in the fifties.Anchor 1: Thanks for the report, Súriel!  Well, we're all wonderingwhat's cooking in the Black Land, aren't we, Sargon?!Anchor 2: Indeed we are, Melineth.Anchor 1: And our first report! looks at preparations for war withinthe City!  Let's go to our star roving reporter, Ariellë Húriniel![Shot of reporter standing in the street shouting into microphone whilegesticulating.]Reporter: Well, all around me the preparations are going on to bringMinas Tirith into a war footing!  But we're by no means unprepared. Ever since trade negotiations with Mordor looked like they were goingto break down over the copyright issue, Lord Denethor has been buyingup stock, hiring corporate lawyers, and dominating the news, scoringcoup after propaganda coup!  We're definitely well positioned to ridethat one out.Anchor 2: Well, that's good to know, Ariellë.  Can you tell us exactlywhere you are right now?Reporter:  I'm right in the absolute thick of things, Sargon; in theheart of the Citadel itself, at the barracks of the Citadel Guard,where, as you can imagine, excitement is rising to a fever pitch![Camera pulls back to reveal an empty, silent street.]Anchor 1:  Ariellë, tell us about that uniform you're wearing!Reporter: Well, as you know, I'm a long-time member of the GuardReserve, and I've just been activated due to the emergency, though Iexpect to continue serving PalanTirith as a reporter.  This is based onthe ancient Atlantean naval uniform, and it's full of symbolism!Anchor 2: I can see that.Reporter: Right now we're going to go into the Guard barracks, and seewhat the boys are up to.  Let's go![Tracking shot follows Ariellë into barracks.  Lights shine on a veryfat old man leaning over one of the beds.]Reporter: Well, as you can see, we have, uh, what we have here is, uh,a man who seems to be engaged in the act of, uh, placing a pillow overthe face of one of the Guards.  Let's see if we can find out more.[The man turns and blinks into the camera]Reporter:  Why, it's Mesprendeur, formerly Court Fool of Gondor! Would you like to tell us what's going on here?*     *     *   Gandalf turned around, sensing difficulties with his plot.  He foundhimself staring down, down, down at a very young woman in the garb of asoldier of the Citadel, holding a microphone into his face.  "Um," hereplied, "I was just engaging in some friendly fraternity hazing..."   The young woman had, however slipped past him with her camera crew,and they were focused on Pipsqueak, still gasping for air.   "Why, aren't you the famous Prince Paragraph of Took, Lord of theHalfwitts?"   "Hobbits," gasped Pipsqueak.  His gasps had less to do with want ofoxygen, or even outrage at the use of traditional Gondorian epithets,than with the woman standing before him.  She was only a few inchestaller than Pipsqueak himself, with long red hair fastened up on eachside by seashell-shaped pins.  She could hardly be older than sixteen,Pipsqueak thought, and wasn't especially well-developed for her age;but she was wearing that remarkable uniform to great effect.   "Hobbits," repeated the woman to the cameras, "is a term in theHalfwitts' quaint northern dialect.  So tell me, Prince Paragraph, howdo you find Gondor?"   "Well, you take the rooad through Edoras, and toorn right at MountMinnie," Pipsqueak said brightly, falling easily into his new rôle andmaking sure to have as rustic an accent as possible.   "So why do you call yourselves hobbits?"   "Oh," said Paragraph, "it's joost a name.  We could 'ave calledourselves 'boggies', bot we liked the sound of 'obbits bettah."   The other guards, who had woken at the sound of the interview,crushed themselves around Pipsqueak and Gandalf, rendering escape forthe latter impossible.   When the messengers from Denethor came laterto summon them, the interview was still going on.   Before long Pipsqueak was walking with Gandalf (under heavy guard)once more down the marble passage to the Tower Hall.  There Denethorsat in the gloom, eyes darting to left and right, like a skitterycockroach ready to bolt into the nearest crack in the wainscoting,Pipsqueak thought; thus intuiting, though he did not know it,Denethor's most common nickname among the folk of Gondor.   Denethor sat staring at the tickertape emerging from a machine onhis desk.  "Belfast Resorts down, MTStarChannel down, Lebanon ThemePark down, PalanTirith way way down..." he mumbled sorrowfully tohimself.  He looked more hopeful when he saw Pipsqueak approaching, andmanaged a sort of smile.   "Well, Master Paragraph, I hope you have enjoyed the City?  Thoughyou may have found fewer drugs available than you hoped for."   Pipsqueak had the uncomfortable feeling that there were a great manysurveillance cameras planted where he could not see them, and mentallythwapped himself for not having thought of that before.   "So, what would you do in my service?  Can you sing?  Tap dance? Jump through hoops?"   "I can sing... a little," Pipsqueak answered half-truthfully.  "Wellenough for my own people.  But we have no songs fit for mighty castlesand theme parks, lord.  We seldom sing of anything more joyous than theassassination of an enemy.  And most of my songs are sad and dolorous,not to mention downright depressing."   "And why should such songs be unfit for my castle?  We who have longoffered entertainment and amusement may surely listen to echoes from aprimitive and barbarous country without such benefits?  Then we may becertain that there remain markets to be exploited."   Pipsqueak's heart sank.  Most of the songs he knew were bawdyballads entirely out of place in the family-oriented atmosphere ofMinas Tirith; but at length he dredged up from his memory a semi-cleanpiece that was pseudo-traditional in his family, to be sung with aBucklebeltland Brogue:   From the day that we're born till the day that we die,   There's never a pleasure that money can't buy,   So pour out the whiskey and drink it with glee,   For Death and the Devil are our company!   In the game-hall we gamble till money be gone,   Then the shirts off our backs go to him who has won,   But never mind money, we'll get more for free,   When Death and the Devil are our company!   In the bawdy-house we'll find Jill, Janet and Rox,   We'll enjoy them each one till they give us the pox,   Which the apothecary cures for a small fee,   Since Death and the Devil are our company!   In a dirty back alley well covered in mud,   A jolly sharp bodkin shall pour out our blood,   The four of us ever together shall be,   We, Death and the Devil in one company!   By the end of this song, Denethor was laughing and pounding hisfist on the table in time to the music.  "Well done!" he cried. "Flunkey!  We've got a new musical here!"   Gandalf interrupted.  "Denethor!" he said.  "We should be talkingabout the Rohirrim and their policies, and the position of Eonard,HeyHoDen's nephew..."   "Nutz to that," Denethor replied.  "I already know all about it. Say, Paragraph, you'd better get into the livery of the Tower, I likeall of my manservants to wear it.  Return when you are suitably clad!"   Pippin wandered somberly from the Tower, hoping against hope that hewould be spared the ordeal.  The weather, as predicted, was quitegloomy, and it was only by sheer accident that, after many hours of "accidentally" wandering around the city (and noting the few gin-jointsand speakeasies still open for business) that he ran into Bererondagain.  Bererond had to chase him for many blocks before catching him;but at last, yielding to the older man's sense of propriety, he foundhimself ensconced with Bererond in a high embattlement of the city,looking out at the scene below and licking his chocolate éclair.      It was the sunset hour, and maybe across the river in EthelienFrodo and Sam were romping in Disgiliath, but here in the shadow ofMinas Minnie nothing so orgiastic could possibly occur. Pipsqueaksighed.  Already it seemed years to him since he had come to MinasTirith, when he had still been a footloose and spendthrift wastrel. Now he was an employee of the Tower of Commerce, earning a salary.  Insome other time and place Pipsqueak might have been pleased with hisbenefit package, but he knew now that with Minas Tirith's stocksinking like a rock, his options were fast becoming worthless.  Hefretted.   "You are concerned about your stock options?" Bererond said cannily.   "Yes," admitted Pipsqueak, "very; but I'm more worried about thedepressing effect this trade war will have on the entire economy.  Notto mention the depressing effect the weather is having on me.  Do youoften have such glooms when the wind is in the East?"   "Nay," said Beregond, "this is no weather of the world.  This issome pollution brewed by the Dark Lord in his great factories inNurnenshire.  Doubtless he is producing some new product that can beproduced more cheaply and in more massive quantities than our owntourist fare."   "Yes," said Pipsqueak.  "I think Gandalf is also worried about thecompetition.  And I think he was disappointed not to find Faramir here. And where has he got to?  He seemed to have lost some argument withDenethor, and was in a bad mood, more so than usual.  Perhaps he hassome foreboding of Bad News."*     *     *Anchor 1: Good evening!

They turn wildly,regain control, and fly off East in a precision formation]Reporter: Stinger anti-aircraft missiles!Anchor 1: What a deal, huh!Reporter [grinning]: And the best part is, we bought them from Mordororiginally!Anchor 2: So what's going on down there?  It looks as if theLamborghini were headed straight for the lead car and....[Distant sounds of crunching metal][A moment of silence]Reporter: We appear to have, er, some kind of a sort of a situationhere.... [sotto voce] damn, that was a nice car.*     *     *   It was not long before a noisy hubbub was heard in the streetsleading up from the outer circles, and there was much cursing andcrying of the names of Faramir and Mesprendeur.  Presently Pipsqueaksaw headlights, and followed by a huge crowd, Mesprendeur riding slowlyon a huge Haug of Mordor (or Harlë in the Elfish tongue).  On hishandlebars, spread in a good imitation of a Pietá, was the limp body ofDoctor Faramir.   Pipsqueak pressed forward as they passed through the gates, and whenhe saw Faramir's death-like face he caught his breath.  It was not thepallor that dismayed him -- he had seen corpses aplenty before -- butthe unholy likeness between Faramir's visage and that of Gandalf ridingbehind.   The Haug screeched to a halt, still belching smoke.  "Friends,"Gandalf said sadly, "I come to you bringing ill news.  Here is DoctorFaramir, who has been, I fear, mortally wounded in the motor accidentthat tragically occurred just as I was saving him from the grip of theevil Black Helicopters."   A sigh arose from the crowd, as well as a high-pitched "No!" fromPipsqueak.  At its sound, Faramir suddenly opened his eyes.   "I'm not dead yet!" he gasped, glazed eyes staring at the heavens. "I have seen... halfwitts!  Like him!" he continued, pointing inPipsqueak's direction, "But in Ethelien, bearing the R..."   At Faramir's first words, Gandalf bent over him with a concernedlook.  One hand of Gandalf's was upon Faramir's breast and anotherbehind his neck as Faramir's last word collapsed into a dying croak. "Alas, alas!" cried Gandalf.  "Faramir has passed away even as he gaveus his last words: 'Victory, victory to Gondor forever!'  Farewell,Prince of Gondor!  Take him away to the Tombs.  Bitter will be thisdeath for Denethor, Steward and CEO."  He bowed his head in grief.   So at length Gandalf and Pipsqueak came to the private chamber ofDenethor.  There were recliners and good central heating, and coldbeers were brought; and Pipsqueak hid behind Denethor's chair, havingno will to get involved in the inevitable argument.   "So, Denethor," Gandalf began, "Now all have seen me risk my lifeto save your son.  Let my good will to Gondor be doubted no more! Alas that I could not give my life to save his!"   Denethor snorted.  "You killed him," he replied.   "Piffle," quoth Gandalf.  "He sustained severe injuries in the caraccident..."   "Which you caused," interposed Denethor.   "Which accidentally happened in the course of my rescue mission. Would you rather he was killed by Nazdaq bullets?"   Denethor shrugged.  "You tell me.  He was your son, after all."   Gandalf arose, red-faced.  "I deny that!"   "Whatever.  In any case, your point is that you have now convincedcertain gullible persons in the City that you are a hero, and youintend to use your new-found status to claim influence.  Very well. What do you want?"   Gandalf drew himself up, and began to speak as if declaiming aspeech long rehearsed.  "The Elder Age is gone, Denethor, Lord of Men. The Middle Ages are passing. Now comes the New Age, and a vast fortuneis to be made selling crystals, beads, books, and tapes of soothingmusic to an immense new market.  This is the world which we must rule!"   "Bullcrap, Gandalf!  That'll always be a niche market and you knowit.  Whereas in every age people want to see movies about bouncyanimals with big eyes, so I'm not worried about these Ages anyway.  Butwhat do you mean 'we'?  You and your tapeworm?"   Gandalf strode up and down the room, making Kow-milking motions withhis hands.  "I am offering you a state beyond your comprehension!  Doyou not see how events have providentially transpired?  Your heirs arelost to you.  But, as if from heaven, there comes from the north ascion of ..."   "I have an heir, Mesprendeur," Denethor calmly interrupted.   "What?" Gandalf sneered.  "Your elder son, Boromir, is mostcertainly dead -- I have reliable reports that he died in a hail ofOrk-bullets across the Anduin..."   "Yes, yes, I know all that."   "You do?"   Denethor winked.  "Never mind."   "And your son Faramir has just died."   "I still have an heir.  And I wasn't planning on dying or goingbonkers just yet, so holdjer horses and wait in line and tell Aragonson of Arabarf,  or whatever his name is, to park his résumé withCentral Casting."   Gandalf stood up, tall and terrible, and fixed Denethor with adeadly piercing gaze.  "My Lord Denethor," he said, "the cares andtroubles of office, the tragical deaths of your two sons, and a rapidlyencroaching senility have weakened your reason.  Your wife Clarabellais long dead, you are old and impotent, and since her death you havepreferred the company of strapping young men in very short sailortunics.  You cannot possibly have an heir."   Denethor burst out laughing.  "Did you come all this way just totry to reclaim your job as Court Fool?  You're just proving that youreally were 'out of the loop'.  I remarried years back, in a smallprivate ceremony to which you were not invited.  And you vastlyunderestimate the power of the loins of the House of Húrin.  As for theGuard uniform - heh - I just think it's cute."   "Then who is this heir?" Gandalf shouted furiously.   "Ah," replied Denethor with a grin, laying a finger aside of hisnose, "perhaps my heir would be safer if left unknown to MonsieurMesprendeur.  I leave it to you to find out.  But I'll give you somehints: despite a certain youthful appearance, my heir has alreadysolo-climbed Mount Minnie, gone spelunking in the Caves of Aglarond,deep-sea-dived in the Bay of Tampalas, defeated the Corsairs in theirown stadium twice, is an astronaut (elenciryamo) in Project Elemmrë,a Brigadier of the Citadel Guard..."*     *     *Anchor 1: So, Ariellë -- I realize this is an especially difficult timefor you -- but can you try to put in words how you feel about the lossof your brother?Reporter [tissue in one hand]: Shocked, Melineth.  Saddened. Grief-stricken.  Upset.  The fall of Doctor Faramir isn't just apersonal loss, it's a loss for all the people of Gondor.  But we allneed to be strong and keep his memory alive by fight, fight, fightingfor the noble Atlantean ideals that he stood for!Anchor 2: We feel your pain and appreciate your patriotic sentiments. Ladies and gentlement, a moment of silence for Faramir Húrinion, MD,PhD, 2983-3019.*     *     *"... and star reporter for PalanTirith, our corporate-run, nationallytelevised newsmagazine.  You really ought to watch that show."   Gandalf wheeled about.  "Great grief will come of this!" he shoutedgrandiloquently.  "You haven't seen the last of me yet!  Come on,Paragraph."  He strode forth boldly from the room, tripped on the edgeof the carpet, and fell on his face.*     *     *Anchor 1:  Good morning!  And welcome! to the morning edition ofPalanTirith! featuring round-the-clock news from Minas Tirith!  I'myour morning anchor, Gwilwileth Lindoriel! and this is my co-host,Gonhir Malbornion!Anchor 2: Thank you Gwil, and good morning.  Today is the eleventh ofSúlime thirty-nineteen.  We'll have late-breaking war news coming up injust a moment.  But first, we turn to our weather correspondent, SúrielGwildol!Weather C.: Thanks, Gon!  Well, it's just going to be totally blahtoday.  There's a thick cloud cover coming out of Mount Viagra, andthat's going to keep the temperatures down in the forties.  No sun, norain expected today or tomorrow; more of the same tonight, with tempsdropping below freezing.Anchor 2: Thanks for the report, Súriel.  And in today's war news, ourSpecial Correspondent Brigadier Ariellë Húriniel has been put incommand of the forces of Gondor in Disgiliath.Anchor 1: That's right, Gon!  While there were disputes over herappointment at the Steward's Council, in the end the voices in favor ofAriellë's overwhelming competence won the day!*     *     *   Early in the morning the Council had been summoned.  There wereDenethor, Lord of the City; Forlong the Fat, Lord of Lotstarch,Captain of Gondor; Ariellë, Steward's heir; Paragraph Took, CourtSongster; and Gandalf the White, recently reinstated, following aseries of truly amazing pratfalls, as Court Fool.  Forlong had had aspecially-built, triple-sized chair brought in for him, and as theinitial formalities were being completed had been snarfing down a loadof unpeeled potatoes provided him in a bushel basket.  "Hieland spuds,specialty o' Lotstarch," he grunted confidentially to Pipsqueak with agrin.  "Guid for wha' ails ye!"   "Friends," Denethor began, "today the fate of Gondor is onthe line.  Our stocks are slipping and our expenses are mounting.  If wecan't fight off Sauron and his corporate lawyers, our trademarks may beinvalidated and poof, there goes our franchise.  We're looking atbankruptcy, lady and gentlemen.  Bankruptcy."   Silence filled the Council hall save for a gasp from Pipsqueak.   Forlong interrupted.  "If I may put in a wee word, my LairdSteuart," he began.  Ariellë sighed and took out a book.     "My Lord Forlong," nodded Denethor.   "Weel, ye see it's this way.  Back in Lotstarch we hae a wee sayin',that findin's keepin', and keepin's haein'.  Noo I am registered andtrademarked, as the custom is, as 'Forlong the Fat', and I canna behaein' imposters imposin' upon my wee scrap o' territory.  So wha' I'maskin' is, why yon porridge-stuffed beggar" -- he pointed at Gandalf --"is gi'en yer Lairdship's countenance at this meeting."   "My Lord Mesprendeur is a very funny fellow," Denethor began toreply.   "Aye, aye, tha's a' very weel, but as we say in Lotstarch, twabellies in ae ruim must come tae blaws.  There's anely ruim enow inGondor for ane fat man, and that man's Forlong.  I insist that this'Gandalf' the Wizard, Clown or whate'er he be, cease and desist frombein' fat for as lang as he dwells in this kingdom.  Those are myrichts, my Laird, and I demand 'em!"   "My Lord Forlong," Denethor answered dubiously, "we are not here todiscuss your trademarks... and I don't see how Gandalf can stop beingfat."   "We'll soon see aboot that," Forlong replied. "I challenge thissae-called Gandalf tae a duel -- here and noo, my laird, here and noo!"   "Not in the Council Hall -- please, my Lord..."   "Och Aye, m'laird!  'Tis written in Ye Olde Medieval Charter thatyer wise ancestors granted to Minas Mickey, that a dispute betweenmembers o' the Council sall be decided anely in the Council Hall!  Myrichts, Laird Steuart! I demand my richts!"   Denethor sighed.  Pipsqueak thought he saw Ariellë mouth wordsacross the table, something like "f....n rules lawyer".     "Denethor!" Gandalf fumed.  "Are you really going to permit thisoutrage?"   Denethor shrugged.  "Court Fools are expendable.  You'd betterprepare yourself.  Lord Forlong, what is the form of the duel?"   "As it e'er has been and sall be... wrastling tae a fall, o' course!"   Forlong rose from the table and began to strip off his clothing. Underneath his tunic, he turned out to be wearing a white loinclothsuspended from a broad black belt.  Stomping to the far end of theCouncil Hall, he began spreading a large circle on the floor, composedentirely of potatoes.  Taking his stance at one side of the circle, hestamped loudly with both feet.     Gandalf, most unwillingly, was pressed into the circle by theothers.  He was not obliged to remove his robes.  Forlong began tocircle around him as Gandalf began to intone "I am Gandalf the White,the Great Wizard.  Hear my words and obey them.  Your limbs are w....OOF!"   Forlong's massive limbs slammed into Gandalf's belly, and reached asfar as they could around his ample girth.  "Huh!" Forlong grunted, asstraining he heaved Gandalf from the ground.   Gandalf arose easily into the air.  "Hah!" Forlong shouted in a toneof surprise.  "Licht as ae feether ye are!  Noo feel the micht o'Forlong the Fat!"  And with a mighty heave he flung Gandalf to thestone floor.   And Gandalf bounced.  Five feet in the air he rose from the pointwhere he had struck the ground, and then he fell, and bounced again. "Wha' sorcery?" exclaimed Forlong, baffled for an instant.  Then agleam came into his eyes.  "My laird Steuart!  I claim foul play andcheatin'!  Yon Mesprendeur's nae fat at a'!"   "What do you mean?" Denethor asked.  Gandalf was sitting, somewhatdazed, chin sunk into his puffy chest.   "I'll shaw ye," Forlong replied, and darted from the ring to thetable, where he picked up and returned a sharp potato knife.   "No bloodshed!  No bloodshed!" cried Denethor in horror.   "Nay, my laird, there'll be nane.  Just a wee cut..."  and with thatForlong stabbed hard into Gandalf's chest.   There was a tearing sound and then an immense explosion.  Forlongwas blown across to one of the side walls.  When the others looked backat Gandalf, blown to the opposite wall, they saw that his chest hadwholly caved in.  "Balloons!" chortled Forlong in glee.  "Th'impostor's been usin' rubber balloons!"   The stunned Gandalf was returned to the table, where a searchrevealed several more balloons.  These removed, he appeared much lessimposing, and spent a long time chewing at his beard and muttering tohimself.   "Now that this trademark dispute has been satisfactorily resolved,"Denethor said, "we can return to our business.  Now I understand,Forlong, that you alone responded to the summons sent to the provinces. Where are the rest of our Field Staff?  Where are Degrevant of RingletVale, Dodinas, Dinadan and Dagonet of the Vale of Martha*, Galahaut of Gwyntystorm, Duke Angér of Lameduc, Hervis of the Green Hills ofVermont, the deep-sea divers of the Ether, and not least of all, whereis Prince Amraphel of Dinas Emrys?"[* Named for an ancient Steward of Gondor.]   "Och," Forlong replied, "Weel, Degrevant was hae'in motor trouble,Dodinas, Dinadan and Dagonet were on vacation, Galahaut had tae attendhis grandniece's wedding, Angér was plannin' a fishin' party, Hervisdidn't feel like it, the deep-sea divers were deep-sea divin', andAmraphel was oot tae lunch, or sae I hae been tald."   "So we have nothing to stand against Sauron's subpoenas, or whateverelse he chooses to throw at us."   "Aye, but we can tak 'em weel, my Laird!  Those Sauron boys arenobbut a rabble o' pantywaists, if ye ask me."   "If the subpoenas are to be served, they'll be served atDisgiliath," Gandalf put in suddenly.  "'Twere best to ambush thelawyers there."   "So who will lead the ambush?" Denethor asked, and silence reignedonce more.   "Mesprendeur has a sartin heroic presence, or sae they tell me,"Forlong said at length, not without sarcasm.   "Yes," answered Gandalf snidely, "but due to a certain person'sinterference, I no longer possess the powers of divine rotundity givenme by the Valar to aid Gondor!  I have heard, however, that the Lordof the City has in his service a person of great strength and skills:astronaut, navigator, skydiver, general..."   "Who, me?" said Ariellë looking up from her book.  "Sure, I'll go."*     *     *Anchor 2:   Good evening, and welcome to our evening edition ofPalanTirith.  I'm Sargon Turgonion; my co-host, Melineth Malthuriel isoff today.  In today's war news, a Flag and Drum Corps has issued fromMinas Goofy and is marching on Disgiliath.  They have been joined byrockabilly bands from the South.  We have also learned that theNameless Tenor, known to many as the Leech-King, is leading them, andthe fear of his singing has passed before him across the River.*     *     *Anchor 1:   Good morning, this twelfth day of Súlimë.  I'm GwilwilethLindoriel, and welcome to our abbreviated morning edition ofPalanTirith.  In today's war news, our boys have suffered a temporaryreverse at Disgiliath, apparently being met not, as they expected, by asubpoena but by large numbers of automatic weapons and some appallingbrass.  Brigadier Ariellë is leading the troops in a strategic movementto the rear, returning to the forts on the wall of the Lammas Ichor. The Court Fool, Lord Mesprendeur, was also dispatched to the front withorders to pick up the mens' spirits.*     *     *Anchor 2:   Good morning on another gloomy day, the thirteenth ofSúlimë.  We have another dispatch from the front.  The enemy hasdynamited, I repeat, dynamited the Lammas Ichor, which now stands inruins and poses no hindrance whatsoever to the advance of the enemy. This a gross contravention of the rules of war which, as finalized inthe Disgiliath Accords, require them to stand on one side of the wallwhile we hurl insults and cows at them.  This is a terrible atrocity.Anchor 1: That's right, Gonhir.  Court Fool Lord Mesprendeur was thefirst to return from the scene of the crime, and has gone straight tothe CEO's office.  And on our northeast flank, the vacation island ofCaer Andrews has also been seized by the enemy, who are now said to beerecting a bandshell there.*     *     *Anchor 1: This is Melineth Malthuriel, reporting to you from the wallof the First Circle.  This is a special edition of PalanTirith,reporting on what is already becoming known as The Siege.Anchor 2 [from studio]: Can you describe what you see behind you, Mel?Anchor 1: Sure can, Sar.  Those men down there are our troops, tryingto get to the wall before the enemy gets here.  The enemy is probablyabout seven miles distant now, and they are within, I repeat, withinthe Lammas Ichor.  We can't see the enemy from here, but in thedistance you can see searchlights.  According to the stories fromretreating survivors, anyone caught in the lights is brutallymachine-gunned.Anchor 2: Have we got any artillery or anything else that we can useagainst them?Anchor 1: Well, Sar, I'm afraid that Minas Tirith was built primarilyas an amusement center and most of the weapons we have are non-workingreplicas.   We were really expecting a legal, not a military attack atthis point, and the story is that we were basically caught with ourpants down.  But I'm told that even as we speak, engineers are combingthe caves under Mount Minnie looking for anything that can help us. Anchor 2 [quiet for a moment]: I see.  Is there any news of Ariellë?Anchor 1: She's supposed to be guiding the retreat.   That may be hercompany back there in the middle of your screen, marching steadilytoward the gate.  They're about a quarter of a mile away right now. And here come some jeeps...[distant sounds of shouting; the whole area is illuminated bysearchlights]Anchor 1: They're under attack, even as we speak!  A company of whatlooks like Orks, and, uh, motorized troops with red flags areattacking.  Our boys are turning to face them and...WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUPAnchor 2: Melineth!?  Are you all right?Anchor 1: It's complete chaos out there!  It looks like we have aNazdaq attack along with everything else![Siren sounds]Anchor 1: There's a siren from our walls -- something's happening downthere -- it's motorcycles!  A whole squadron of harli from our side! And there's Forlong the Fat leading them![Very Loud Sound of Explosion]Anchor 1: I think a missile's just gone off near one of the Nazdaqs. That must be one of the Stingers.   The Nazdaq and the other troops areretreating.  We seem to be picking up what survives of Ariellë'scompany and returning to the gate.  We're going to go down off the walland see if we can get some pictures from Gate Square.Anchor 2 [in grim tones]: So just to recap what we've seen in the lastfew minutes.  Our troops, retreating from the walls which the enemydynamited earlier today.  One of our companies attacked by enemy troopsand Nazdaqs.  Ariellë Húriniel: her fate unknown.Anchor 1: Okay, Sar, we're back.  Can we get a picture here?  This isForlong the Fat, Lord of Lotstarch, carrying what looks to be the bodyof Ariellë in his arms?Anchor 2: How is she?Anchor 1: I can definitely see some blood.  No sign of movement. They're putting her into a City Ambulance, so I assume she's not dead. Let's talk to one of the men who was with her.  Private, can you tellus what happened?Soldier: Yeah, uh, we was marchin' back after the snafu at Disg, an wesuddenly got spotted an' fired on by a Suthren jeep column.  LadyAriellë took a bullet just before the cycles came in.Anchor 2: And so we end our Special Edition of PalanTirith.  Our boys,safely back in the city.  Brigadier Ariellë, wounded and taken tohospital.  Lord Forlong has gone to discuss matters with the CEO. Until next time, I'm Sargon Turgonion.*     *     *Anchor 1:  Good morning!  And welcome! to the morning edition ofPalanTirith! featuring round-the-clock news from Minas Tirith!  I'myour morning anchor, Gwilwileth Lindoriel! and this is my co-host,Gonhir Malbornion!Anchor 2: Thank you Gwil, and good morning.  Today is the fourteenth ofSúlime thirty-nineteen, and Day One of the Siege of Gondor.  If youtake a look out at the Pelennor this morning, you'll see some drasticchanges in the scenery.Anchor 1: That's right, Gon.  The Pelennor is entirely occupied byenemy troops, who have set up camps and have been digging trenches and,we hope, latrines.  We also see what appear to be emplacements formortars and howitzers.  Behind them are what appear to be largecompanies of tanks that crossed the river last night.  We still lookfor reinforcements out of Edoras, but whether any help will come fromthe Riddlemark remains a riddle.Anchor 2: Speaking of riddles, some of you may have been wondering whatthat awful noise is that started about midnight last night.Anchor 1: And the answer is, that it's a brass orchestra out therepracticing.  If we zoom in to our left, we'll see a large banner spreadout over those three-story-tall amplifiers projecting the music thisway; you'll also be able to see the Flag and Drum Corps practicingtheir moves.Anchor 2: Looks pretty good, Gwil!  So tell me, what does the bannersay?Anchor 1: It's written in an Orkish variety of runic, but our expertsagree that it says something like "Ragmug's All-Brass Military MarchingBand."Anchor 2: Let's see if we can get some audio pickup from out there. How are we doing?  All right, this is what it sounds like:[Clashing brass and throaty voices singing off key 'La Cucaracha, laCucaracha, ya no puede caminar; porque no tiene, porque le falta,miruvóre que tomar...']Anchor 2: I think we don't need much more of that...[Sound of huge explosion]Anchor 1: What was that?[Shadow passes in front of cameras]Anchor 2: I've just been handed a notice saying that the enemy arelaunching incendiary missiles into the city.  They are landing all overthe city.  Anything outside that is flammable may burn.  Please stayindoors and do not go outside.  Make sure that all flammable goods aretaken inside.  We will update you as necessary.[WHUP WHUP WHUP WHUP]Anchor 1 (plaintively): Oh, sh*t, I hate those choppers.*     *     *   During all this black day Ariellë lay upon her bed in a bunkerbeneath the Tower of Commerce, in a fever that no amount of quininewould assuage.  'Dying', someone said; and soon 'dying' was repeated upand down the streets of the city.  By her Denethor sat, and watched,and let the strings of government slip into the hands of pettyfunctionaries.   One of these was Pipsqueak Took, who now waited upon Denethor, notsinging songs now, but tasked with telling anyone who came there fororders to go away. For long hours he sat by the Steward, hearingnothing but the shouting of the Civil Defence Brigades, the snarlingsounds of distant brass instruments, and the whup whup whup of theNazdaq.  He saw Denethor crying silently.   "Don't cry," he said.  "She could get better.  Did you ask Gandalf?"   Denethor spat.  "Why should I ask the fool?  His hope has failed. The Enemy owns our trademarks now.  This is even as Gandalf wished it:the utter end of the House of Húrin.  Mean folk shall run what remainsof our franchise, selling tee-shirts and coffee-mugs at roadsideconcessions, making what profits they can on the black market untilMordor finally deprives them of their licenses."   Men came to the door crying for the CEO.  "Nay, I will not comedown," he said.  "I must stay beside my daughter.  Follow whom youwill, even the Court Fool, though his hope has failed.  Here I stay."*     *     *Anchor 1: Good evening, I'm Melineth Malthuriel, continuing our SiegeBroadcast from PalanTirith's new studio in a bunker under the SeventhCircle.  Sargon Turgonion will not be with us, as he was killed earliertoday in a Nazdaq incendiary bombing raid.  In other news, Denethor,Steward and CEO of Gondor, has effectively abdicated, turning powerover to Court Fool -- now Generalissimo -- Mesprendeur who will becharge of Defence Ops.  He's been making the rounds of the walls,trying to put some spirit back into the men with light humor andjuggling tricks, but unfortunately everybody gets depressed again oncehe leaves.  And why shouldn't they be?  We're all going to die realsoon.  [sigh]  Well, let's go to Gonhir Malbornion who is now reportingfrom the First Circle and can tell us just how hopeless the situationis.Reporter: It does look pretty hopeless, Mel.  If you take a lookaround, you'll see that the entire First Circle is on fire due to theincendiaries.  The enemy has been using explosive artillery against theouter wall, but they haven't been able to do much.  But smaller bombshave been launched against the upper circles, and they've been doing alot of damage, in some cases levelling entire sections of wall.  You'relucky to  be up there in those bunkers.Anchor 1: I don't feel lucky, Gon.Reporter: If you look behind me, you'll be able to see the tanksmassing in the area just in front of the Great Gate.  It looks as ifthat's where the main assault will come.Anchor 1: And then it will be over, Gon?Reporter: Maybe, but I suppose we'll all be dead by then.*     *     *   Messengers came again to the Tower chamber, and this time Pipsqueaklet them enter.  "Bombs are falling all over the City, Lord," theysaid.  "What do you want us to do?  Nobody wants to follow Mesprendeur,much less stay on the walls and offer a target visible from seven milesaway."   "Fly," muttered Denethor, looking at one that buzzed around thechamber with a hungry look.  "Why don't the fools fly?  They could ifthey had wings.  But we all have wings, even the Balrogs.  We could flyaway from here, somewhere over the rainbow, way up high..."   "There are reports, Sir, that the enemy is contemplating a gasattack.  Should we start distributing gas masks and pills?  There areonly enough for a few of us."   "Gas," said Denethor.  "Better to be gassed sooner than later, forlife's a gas.  And I?  I will go to my gas chamber!  For it's all rightnow.  In fact it's a gas!  I'm Jumping Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas,gas!"   The messengers turned and fled.   Denethor looked at Pipsqueak and winked.  "That always works," hewhispered.  "Well, we'd better evacuate.  Probably the safest place isthe Tombs, on the other side of the Hill, under Mount Minnie.  Callsome servants and we'll take Ariellë there.  And, if we're lucky, we'llsoon see the Angels of Avalon."   Pipsqueak called the servants, and taking up Ariellë's bed theyclimbed out of the bunker into the Seventh Circle.  The clouds abovethem were lit with red flashes from explosions and the white ofsearchlights.  The sound of the Nazdaq choppers rang clear through thestill air.  Its own floodlights out, the Castle of Lornavaniwen loomeddark against the clouds behind them.  Denethor stopped by Tarzan'sTreehouse and sighed.   They passed on into the Sixth Circle, and soback west to the rear of the City.  There, where the walls were stainedwith graffiti, stood an almost unregarded, inconsequential lookingdoor, painted a peeling pale green, with a keyhole in the center of itsmetal knob.  Postno Bills it was called, on account of the stenciledletters faintly spraypainted on it.  Beyond it went a winding road thatdescended into the narrow land between Minas Tirith and Mount Minnie,where half the City threw its garbage.   It was also the place of the Tombs of the Stewards.  Denethorfished the key out from his rather impressive keyring and unlocked thedoor, and they wound on down the road, Denethor holding a lanternhigh.  Pipsqueak shuddered gloomily, for it was cold; and he did not atfirst notice Denethor speaking to him.  "...eward Berendan sailed intothe West.  There he came upon the island of the fallen angels, theAngels of Avalon, who live in a great tree covered with white feathersfrom their wings; for the sky is filled with good and bad that mortalsnever know.  They sheltered him, and promised him that if ever the Citywas in danger, they would come up out of the sunrise..."   "Er, what?" said Pipsqueak.  "The sunrise in the west?"   "So the prophecy is told.  And they would fight on behalf of Gondoragainst the Tyrant, the Evil One, and the Dragon of Darkness."   "Um, that's nice," Pipsqueak muttered.  Obviously the old man hadlost his mind.   They came at last to the Silent Street, and entered the House of theStewards.  In this chamber were many stone tables, and on each was asleeping form.  "Suspended animation," hissed Denethor.  At a sign,the servants laid Ariellë down on an empty stone table.  Then Denethorspoke in a low voice.   "Here we will wait," he said.  "But send not for the embalmers, forshe is not dead, and will not die, I think.  While the the Dark Lordrides in force we shall remain here, waiting for the Angels of Avalon,waiting for the eastern glow.  Time will tell us all.   You may go. Farewell!"   "By your leave, lord!" said Pipsqueak and turned and fled.  What adangerous lunatic he thought to himself.  Needs a real goodpsychotherapist.  I had better find Gandalf.  As he came back into thesixth circle the sounds of the bombing returned again to his ears. Missiles were arching high above the walls in flaming streaks, andleaving glaring flashes of electric white where they touched down. Even as he watched on in dismay, three missiles struck within theseventh circle, and with a hideous rumble, the white Castle ofLornavaniwen shuddered and fell into ruin.   Pipsqueak ran on, down, down toward the outer city.  Some folk,seeing his sailor tunic, turned and shouted, but he paid no heed.  Atlast he came into the First Circle, where the fires were still raging. But it had become strangely silent; for a moment, it seemed, theshelling and missile attacks had halted.  No other noise could beheard.   Then suddenly there was a dreadful, high-pitched wail, and a deepechoing boom.  Shaking in fear, Pipsqueak forced himself forward intothe Gate Square.  There he stopped. He had found Gandalf, but couldproceed no further.   Ever since midnight the assault had proceeded apace.   The drums ofthe Flag and Drum corps rolled, while the brass crashed and thetrumpets brayed to the hoarse voices of the Orken army.  Ever and anonthe artillery spat fire against the walls; but their Captain cared notif they actually hit anything, their purpose was only to keep the menof the City busy in many places.  Made by the ancient Atlanteans fromAdamantium, no cannon or missile blast could pierce the armor platingof that wall.  But the weak link in the whole wall was the Gate; andagainst it the enemy was throwing all its strength.   The drums rolled louder, shaking the castle walls.  Tanks crawledacross the field; but on the ground in front of the Gate, reckingnought of any counterattack from the First Wall, were explosive expertssetting up their charges.  Long wires ran back from the Wall to thedetonator.   The drums rolled wildly.  Over the hills of the slain that hadfallen before the gate the Ringwraith rode in black, the Nameless Tenorcome to exult over his foe.   He rode slowly, caring nothing for thechatter of small arms fire that still came from the walls.  He haltedjust before the gate, and removed some sheet music from his breastpocket.  And as he did so a great fear fell on all, defender and foealike, and the gunfire fell silent.  For a moment all was still.   Then in the distance the orchestra began to play, no marching tunethis time, but an aria --- and with that the Black Captain cried aloudin a dreadful voice, singing in some forgotten tongue words of powerand terror to shatter both eardrums and glass:      La donna è mobile qual pium' al vento,      Muta d' accento -    e di pensiero.      Sempre un' amabile   leggiadro viso,      In piant' o in riso, è menzognero.      La donna è mobil' qual pium' al vento,      Muta d' accento -    e di pensier',      e di pensier',    e di pensier'!      è sempre misero   chi a lei s'affida,      Chi le confida -  mal cauta il core!      Pur mai non sentensi felice appieno      Chi su quel seno -   non libo amore!      La donna è mobil' qual pium' al vento,      Muta d'accento -  e di pensier',      e di pensier',    e di pensier'!   And suddenly, on the last shrieking high note, an unseen handpressed the detonator and the Gate of Gondor burst asunder: there wasa flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragmentsto the ground.   In rode the Lord of the Nazdaq, under the archway that no enemy hadever passed without a ticket, and all fled before his face.   All save one.  There sat Gandalf upon his Mordor-made Haug, whichalone among the vehicles of Gondor had failed to start, despiterepeated attempts.   "You cannot enter here," croaked Gandalf, and the Leech-king halted. "Go back to the cheap recording studio prepared for you!  Go back! Fall into the nothingness of low ratings and popular disdain thatawaits you and your Master!  Go!"   The Ringwraith let fall his cloak, and behold!  He was all clad informal evening wear, with white tie and black tail coat.  A conductor'sbaton was in one hand, and a glass of champagne in the other.  Hechuckled drily.   "Old Fool!" he said.  "This is my hour.  Didst thou think thoucouldst upstage me?  Die now, with thy vulgar commercializedentertainment, and curse in vain!"  And with that he lifted high hisright hand and an electric shimmer ran down his baton.   Gandalf still could not start his Haug.  And at that very moment, insome unburnt apartment adjoining the Gate Square, an alarm clock wentoff.  BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP...   Shrill and clear it beeped, caring nothing of opera or rock'n'roll,knowing only that it was set at 6:30 a.m.   And as if in answer there came from far away another sound.  Sirens,sirens, sirens, echoing from the sides of Mount Minnie.  Sirens of thehordes of the North.  Edoras had come at last.
     It was dark and Morrie (Otto) was awakened by the smell of gasoline andburning tires.   He felt the throb in his head and remembered the nightbefore.  He remembered being thrown out of the Winnebago.  "Stupid blonde," hecursed.  "I should have never ridden with her.  Oh, what the heck; I'm Morrie,or someone like that, now, and I'm supposed to go around riding on motorcycleswith hot royalty."     He dimly recall the wild night of riding the bike through the plains ofRohan.  Eowynifred's hair blowing in his face.  The smell of her perfume andWormtounge's liquids on her.  And then the crash.  Eowynifred, in a momentof frenzied ecstasy, had rode the bike so fast that she forgot to watch outfor the King and the dwarves.  She plowed through the dwarves and chargedstraight into HeyHoDen and his mount which had just stopped to take a dump."Stupid blonde..."     Just then Eonard tumbled over Morrie's (Otto's) prostrate form in thedarkness.     "What the hell?"     "Oh, sorry dude, I didn't mean to trip you."     "Sure you didn't.  What the hell are you doing out here anyway?"     "I fell off the motorcycle and just got up.  I was talking to myself."     "Sure you were, you pothead.  Playing with yourself is more like it.  Iswear I heard you say the word blonde..."     After merrily clearing up this mess with Eonard, Morrie (Otto) set out withhim to see what HeyHoDen was up to.  They found the King sitting at thenearest Taco Bell munching on a chalupa while Balin and the dwarves satnearby.     "Stupid pigs, I told then I wanted the damn dog in the commercial, not thechalupa," growled HeyHoDen.     "Now, now," said Balin, "Its better than crap you know."     "Actually I rather prefer crap.  A little ketchup makes a huge difference,you know," commented Wormtounge.     "Shut up, you fool,"  said HeyHoDen.  "We are totally screwed in the ass.Those pigs are gonna catch up with us before we get to Gondor and the Citything."     "Just wish there was some wild man to show us a short cut to -"     Just then a totally naked man jumped in front of them.  He wore nothingbut a feather in his hair and held a crushed Coke can in his hand.  Eowynifrednearly fainted with delight.     "How."     "How?"     "HOW."     "How?"     "How.  I am Sitting Bull of the injuni.  I come to make peace andsmoke weed with the white man."     "Hey, count me in too,"  said Morrie (Otto).     "Listen, you naked old freak," HeyHoDen shouted. "We don't need weed, weneed a shortcut through the woods so that we can plunder Gondor."     "Don't listen to that dildo,"  shouted Morrie, even louder, "Give me thatpipe, man."     The injun reached behind him and with a grunt produced a pipe.     "Ain't nothing like a wide anus to store your pipe in, man," commentedEonard.     Sitting Bull grinned and proceeded to light it up and pass the pipe around.After everyone was totally stoned he proceeded to talk.     "I help you find shortcut.  I show you way to Stoned City.  There youdestroy Magic Mountain and that bastard Denethor.   As he dies tell himnever to throw trash in my forests again.  Then you leave injuni alone totheir pipe-weed smoking.  Aight?"     "Sure thing,"  said Balin. "Lead the way, dude."     "Wait up," shouted HeyHoDen, "what if this naked freak of nature leads usinto a trap and kills us all?"     "Then we'll kill him," said Balin.     "But if we're already dead how are we gonna kill--" muttered Eonard.     "Splendid," shouted HeyHoDen.  "Lead the way, Sitting Bull.  And remember,the only good injun is a dead injun."     The small company consisting of the royal family, Morrie (Otto), thedwarves, and Sitting Bull passed into the forest.  They traveled andtraveled and traveled.  After some time they stopped to view the wonders ofDunland.  They saw Pooh in the honey tree.  "Yum, yum."  They saw thelamppost still burning bright.  HeyHoDen went over for a walk with Aslan andlearned new and interesting ways to impersonate Christ.  Robin Hoodhimself dropped by for a chat and got instantly hooked on Eowynifred.  Heinsisted on calling her Maid Marian and followed her for many miles untilshe utterly rejected him by making sweet love to Sitting Bull.  Robininstantly took his arrow and slit his own wrists, dying in a pool of his ownblood, rejected by a fair lover.  They journeyed on, stopping at fast foodrestaurants and eating plain old crap when there was nothing else.  And sothis relievingly short chapter drew to an end as Morrie (Otto) sat on theground and prepared some "grass" with a couple of injuni who had come alongfor the ride.     "Tomorrow, Gondor and all her riches and glory," muttered HeyhoDenearnestly.     "Can't wait to get my hands on Denethor,"  injected Eowynifred.  "I'veheard that those Stewards are great in bed, way better than the Kings of old -like that sad flab Aragorn, or whatever his name is."     "Oh, man, this weed is great."     "Hell yeah."     "Morrie, when this war stuff is over, I'm coming over to the Shire andgrowing a plantation for myself."     "Hell yeah."     "Good stuff, this pipe weed."     "Hell yeah."     "Don't hell yeah me, you dingaling.  I'm the King, HeyHoDen theMighty Pipe and Bong Smoker."     "Hell yeah."     HeyHoden smiled, lay down in his sleeping bag, farted and started strokingthe lovable hobbit (Otto).     "HELL YEAH."
  As the alarm sounded the Lord of the Nazdaq looked at his watch,proferred an inappropriate expletive for a kid's amusement park and ranout the gate again, muttering something about being late for his lectureon the arts in war.  Seeing this, Gandalf went back to "cheering" thedefenders with his peddler's trick.  His real purpose was of course tosteal their purses while their concentration was elsewhere. Since heabsolutely hates to pick money off a dead corpse, he always tries todo it before they die.  Going back in time a bit, let's look at what really happened beforeHeyHoDen sounded his horns.  As HeyHoDen was galloping towards MinasTirith the injuni leading him saw the cowboys ahead and left indisgust, leaving the Rohirrim suddenly in the front of the battle.Meanwhile his army of seven acrobatic dwarves insisted on making asmall detour by their house which was close by.  When they got there,they went in and left a message that read as follows: Snow White, wehave gone to help HeyHoDen defend Minas Tirith, as soon as you comeback home with your Prince Charming, could you send him along with hisarmy to give us a hand, thank you.  After this small interlude theycontinued their dash towards the battle field, to find it all aflame,and they figured that no one had heard their horns since none stoppedto great them.  At this, HeyHoDen felt that his special greeting forAragon was definitly deserved.  His whole plan rested on Gondorbelieving him to be an ally and thus letting him through the ticketbooth. Once inside, he could safely prepare a greeting for Aragon thathe would remember for the rest of his days - since his days wouldscarcely exceed his entrance into Minas Tirith.    As he was riding hard for the gate, HeyHoDen came by all nine Nazdaq. They were intently listening to one who appeared to be their leader byhis girth. He was rambling on about something, and the words art and warkept coming up pretty often.  While he talked he kept on pointing atdifferent parts of the battlefield and the fortifications.  WhenHeyHoden was level with them he clearly heard him say "break time" andnext thing he knew they were all signing and clapping rhythmically whileone of their number danced jerkily; which brought them all, includingHeyHoden, into fits of laughter, and a weird state of physicalattraction for them.  Sadly for him, HeyHoden learnt that one should notlaugh hysterically or look to the side for too long while riding as hetoppled and his mount fell on him.  His wounds were so extensive thathe had but a few moments of life left.  Close behind him Dirthead tried to reach him while he was still alive,but the chief Nazdaq was in her way.  When he saw her he yelled, "Youmay not pass; we are on a class field trip and have priority, you have tolet us pass!"  This led to a long-winded bickering match on who wouldpass first.  The hissy fight was settled in the following fashion:  "No man as small as you may force me to go against the rules of courtesy!"  Dirthead removed his helmet and answered, "But I am no man, I amEowynifred!" and she nimbly dodged around the huge girth of the Nazdaq toattack him with her secret weapon.  When she reached his back she grabbedonto his underwear, yanked them up and shouted "WEDGIIIIIIIE!".  At thesame time Otto, who had fallen off the Harley, was picking up a sword toineffectively defend himself; but the great girth of the Nazdaq had causedthe wedgie to have terrible effect and he stumbled forwards and onto theblade which Otto was holding up.  It stabbed him straight through the heartand he died instantly.  Try as he might afterwards, Otto could never findhis blade again amidst all the folds of the Nazdaq's stomach.  Seeing theirteacher fall in such a way, the rest of the Nazdaq fled in despair.  Arguing over who had killed the the Nazdaq (they both had good arguments,one being the bearer of the weapon and the other having gotten the Nazdaq tofall), Otto and Eowynifred decided to settle the matter with a fist fight. To their future despair they each managed to knock the other unconscious, andto this day this feud hasn't been settled.   As all of this happened Eonard realized he had been left alone on the battle-field, and tried to find his "army".  He did find them, but HeyHoDen wasalmost dead and the other two were already unconscious.  He went to hisfather who made him swear to kill Aragon at the first occasion he couldfind when he could make it pass as an accident.  Eonard swore and asked hisdying father whether he could do anything to ease his last moments, at whichHeyHoDen replied:  "The only thing which would make me happy is if you found a way to make mydeath fake, or resurrect me (which is quite plausible in this story) so that Imay retired at an old folks' complex, much like the one we passed on our wayhere...."  With that HeyHoDen King of Edoras died.  As he saw the seven dwarves weep forthe late king, Eonard told then not to weep; for now Rohan had a strong king,and he would not have let those pigs desert them, he would have chained them anddragged them behind Harleys to get them to respect his might.  "But no morefretting," he said, "let us join this fray once more to find Aragon!"  So heleft, too happy to be King to care for his safety, and did not see Otto wake up.  Otto awoke painfully. He groggily brought Eowynifred to the city ticket booth,paid the exhorbitant entrance fee, and dragged her to the infirmary; he reallywanted to know how to ride like her.  If he was going to take over Morrie'sdrug cartel, he had to have an awe-inspiring skill like that one.  As the men of Gondor, who by then were totally demoralized byGandalf's lame tricks, saw Eonard fight, they were inspired to performdeeds of glory.  They aranged a sortie with the cowboys of the Pelennor,and started circling the students of Mordor.  To their dismay theyfound out that the graduates and men with black feet and white hands hadbeen kept as reserves by the late rector of Mordor university.  His vicerector, seeing the turn of events, decided to send them in, so that theyin turn started circling the cowboys, but they were obviously going inthe opposite direction as the cowboys were.  From far off on the AnduinAragon's party was rowing up the the river on a barge, their number wasthe same as when they entered the Paths of the Living plus one goofylooking character. However, the current being as it was and they havingonly two paddles, they had a hard time getting there.  But Aragon wasrejoicing; he had read all of Goscinny's books, and he knew how to winthe fight considering the twist it had taken.  He only hoped that JollyJumper would be up to the task.  Babar! Aragon again sneered at HeyHoDen's insolence. Babar! To giveAragon a steed that bore a kingly name! It was as if HeyHoDen was sayingthat Aragon was less-kingly material than his bearer. So it was that atthe first available opportunity Aragon had halted his group, stood beforethe mumak, announced, "I hereby rechristen thee Jolly Jumper", andbroke a bottle of Dom Peregrin across its head. Aragon smiled at the memory.The subsequent memory of the angry mumak picking him bodily up and throwinghim into a tree, and the subsequent pain in his side, he tried with difficultyto forget.  The battle for Gondor went on and on and on. After approximatly 1 hourof rowing, or circling depending on who you listen to, the fight was ended,the cowboys mysteriously turned out victorious, the Mordor students werefleeing, many of them planned on complaining to the Student Society of MordorUniversity (SSMU) for the low quality of their frosh week, and Aragon'sbarge reached the shore.  Seeing a group of five students who seeminglywanted to steal their raft, Aragon directed his meager force into adefensive position, and coordinated the defense from a safe distancebehind his men.  As the last orc died, he rushed towards it and madesure to be splattered with blood; that way he could pretend to have beenin the heat of the battle.  At the same time as the barge reached shoreEonard directed his steed at full speed towards the barge, hoping toreach it on time to pretend a fumble at the same time as he killedAragon.  Sadly, he reached the shore 30 seconds after the last orc diedand his plan fell to shambles. His only option was to pretend to behappy to see Aragon again.  And Aragon was only to happy to explain toall how he had played a crucial part in the fight, and he had a briuse(which he got the last time Jolly Jumper toppled under his weight), andblood all over him (which he poured himself).
  The Leech-king withdrew, blistering the air with curses.  At thatmoment the Haug finally started up again and Gandalf revved theengine, preparing to ride through the gate.  Pipsqueak panicked andran in front it, nearly getting squashed by the tires.  "What the hell are you doing?" screamed Gandalf.  "You nearly gotus both killed!  Besides, is it not a law in the City that those whowear the sailor's shirt must stay in the Citadel?"  "Denethor has gone mad!" cried Pipsqueak.  "He's raving aboutangels or something!"  Gandalf looked through the Gate, and already on the field he heardthe sound of dancing.  He clenched his fist and hoped that the Nazdaqwouldn't steal his entire audience.  "I must go. The Leech-king is abroad and he will yet bring the culture of Mordor upon us," he said.  "But Ariellë!" cried Pipsqueak.  "She is still alive, and they willgas her if we don't stop them!"  "She is alive?" asked Gandalf.  "What are you talking about? Bequick!"  "Denethor has gone to the tombs, and he has taken Ariellë, andhe said life is a gas, and he's waiting for the angels or something. Can't you save her?"  Gandalf muttered something about working right with his plans, andwhy should he leave, which Pipsqueak didn't hear.  Pipsqueak tugged onGandalf's robes and cried, "Don't just stand there, please hurry!"  "I will come," said Gandalf.  "If Ariellë is truly alive, then I'llhave to do something about that."  Then he turned the Haug around andraced up the streets of Minas Tirith.  Then as they approachedthe slopes of Mount Minnie, the streets got to narrow for the Haugand Gandalf left it behind.  Coming to the green door Gandalf passedthrough it and went down the garbage-strewn road that led to theHouse of the Stewards.  Once they reached the House, Gandalf sprang up the steps.  "What isthis madness, Denethor?" he exclaimed.  "The houses of the deadare no place for the living.  Where is your daughter, Ariellë?"  "Madness?" replied Denethor.  "I am not mad, Mesprendeur.  Ifeigned insanity so your friend would bring you here.  And here youwill be tried for your crimes against Gondor.  We may be doomed,but I will make sure you pay the price for dooming us."  Then the room lit up with lights and Gandalf saw that he had indeedbeen decieved.  This was no chamber of the dead, or even cryogenicallypreserved heads, but a courtroom.  "A trial?" he asked in a sneeringtone of voice.  "For what?  I have committed no crimes."  "No crimes?" replied Denethor.  "Mesprendeur, you are chargedwith treason, two counts of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, anda host of other assorted offenses."  "You have no proof," snorted Gandalf.  Suddenly Denethor laughed, and leaped onto a bench.  He reachdunder his robes and drew out a Palantarium.  Pipsqueak gazed at inamazment, for it was smaller than the Palantarium which was given toAragon, though he did not now that this was the famed LaptopPalantarium of which many legends tell.  Then, activating the Valatilë software that had been installed onthe Palantarium, Denethor began to project some images on ascreen behind him.  Pipsqueak gazed upon it with wonder, but Gandalfbegan to feel uneasy about and hoped fervently that the uneasiness didnot show on his shifty face.  "Do I not know thee, Mesprendeur?"laughed Denethor.  "So!  With the left hand you would use me tofurther your own twisted goals, and with the right bring up thisRanger of the North to supplant me."  The image on the screenfocused, and Pipsqueak saw that it was Aragon, at the Falls of Rauros.He claimed to Giggly and Lego-lass that Boromir was dead, andthen kicked the warrior to shut him up when he protested.  "So yourpawn tried to eliminate my son, no doubt on your orders, but it didn'twork.  Boromir lived."  Then the image wavered and shifted, nowshowing Boromir travelling through the Dead Marshes.  "Luckily forme, your Ranger requires a short leash; every time you let him out ofyour sight, he always botches your plans up."  Then the image shiftedagain, showing Boromir falling in a hail of bullets, and thencoming back to life in the Passages of the Dead, with a goofy-lookingface which Aragon had given him.  "I don't know what kind of sick game Aragon is playing; but he willfind becoming king to be difficult, if Boromir still lives. Let's move on."  The image wavered again, and then it showed Gandalftalking to Aragon at Deem's Help.  They spoke in the words of AuldHigh Elvish, which few in the courtroom understood, but the footagehad been edited with subtitles so everyone would know what was beingsaid.  As everyone in the courtroom listened to the conversation,sweat began beading on Gandalf's forehead.  "What else does he have inthat cursed thing?" he thought.  Then Denethor spoke again.  "Sohere we have proof from your own mouth of your treasonous conspiracyto overthrow the lawful government of Gondor."  Gandalf decided it was time to start bluffing.  "Ha!" he said.  "Whohear actually understands Auld High Elvish?  For all anyone knows,Aragon and I could have been discussing barbecue recipies to sharewith the Rohirrim!"  Denethor smiled at him mirthlessly.  "I have more evidence topresent to the court, Mesprendeur."  Then the image shifted to thefoot of Eyesore in Isengard.  Gandalf faced a number of accusations,each worse then the others.  At length he lost his composure, and thenkilled Aruman.  "What the hell?" wondered Pipsqueak to himself. "That's not how I remember it at all!"  But then it all started comingback to him; and he eyed Gandalf fearfully, edging away from him.  While Pipsqueak was remembering what really happened at Deem'sHelp, Denethor went on.  "Aruman discovered your plot and exposed youGandalf, and so you killed him and tried to cover everything up. That's the first count of murder.  As for attempted murder..."  Thescreen then went dark; it was night in Pipsqueak's bedchamber. Gandalf loomed over Pipsqueak's bed, preparing to smother him with apillow, stopped only by the reporters which entered the room a momentlater.  "After your companion revealed the existence of Aragon youtried to kill him, fearing what else he might expose.  It wouldn'thave mattered anyway, Mesprendur, since the Palantarium seeseverything."  Gandalf had in the meantime had been biting his nailsnervously and had given himself a manicure.  Denethor paid him no heed.  "As for the second count ofmurder," he continued.  The screen shifted to the rout fromDisgiliath, just before the Siege began.  "Everyone believes Ariellëwas shot by a Southron during the retreat, but the Palantarium caughtwhat really happened." The screen shifted to Forlong's rescue. Gandalf was riding with them.  As Forlong tried to convince Ariellëthat she had to leave, Gandalf looked around, and then pulled a gunout from under his robes and shot her in the back.  No one noticed inall of the confusion and chaos.  "You arranged the death of Boromir and shot Ariellë yourself tomake sure that Dr Faramir would succeed me, since you've alreadybribed him heavily to follow you.  Ever since Sauron captured you andpaid you off at Dol Guldur, you've been plotting the downfall of theHouse of Hurin.  You may have succeeded, but you will not live toenjoy your success."  Then Gandalf knew he had no other recourse.  He popped a canister oftear gas out from under his robes.  As everyone coughed and choked, heknocked Pipsqueak out, and drawing a knife stabbed everyone else inthe room.  Then he headed through a small door in the back to theboiler room and rigged it to blow.  He raced out of the House and upthe garbage-strewn streets just as the city was rocked by anexplosion.  He looked behind him and saw the remains of the House ofStewards, now gutted with roaring flames.  "That should take care ofthe evidence," he said to himself.  All that survived the explosionwas the Palantarium, but all the incriminating data had been destroyedin the explosion, and it was said afterwards that anyone who lookedinto it saw only the logo of Gondor: a large black circle toppedwith two smaller black circles.  Before waking Pipsqueak up, Gandalf cast a spell of forgetfulnessover him and gave him some false memories to cover up what hadhappened.  But in his haste and nervousness, he forgot a keyincantation.  He shook Pipsqueak awake.  "What happened?" Pipsqueakasked.  "Where am I?"  "Alas!" said Gandalf.  "He lost his mind, and blew up the House ofthe Stewards in his despair.  I barley managed to save you."  "I see," said Pipsqueak carefully.  Now that his head was startingto clear, he remembered what happened in the courtroom; and he realizedthat he had to be careful and keep his mouth shut if he was to stayalive.  They continued on toward the Citadel, and then heard a greatvoice shout, "Wedgiiiie!"  Gandalf hurried over to the wall and sawwhat happened.  "What was that?" asked Pipsqueak.  "It would seem that the great Tenor of our enemies has beendestroyed," he said, "but not without grievous pain, for from thisdeed will arise a great flame war.  So long has the reach of Sauronbecome.  And now I see how his will was able to enter this city. Sauron must have taken the Palantarium from Minas Goofy.  Using thatstone, he must have set up a chat room, where he made his foul planswith Denethor, and probably Aruman as well.  Gandalf looked over the wall again, and saw that Aragon had arrived.  "Now I must go down to the field to greet Aragon and Eonard.  Comewith me!"  Pipsqueak followed quietly.  He hoped Gandalf's planshadn't doomed Frodo, and that working class hobbit - what was his name?Sandy? It didn't matter.  Pipsqueak knew he was the only one who couldsave them all.
     A mist was over Otto's eyes as he stumbled through the smoking ruins of battle, nursing his jaw where Eowynnie had belted him with her heavy mailed glove. He was too tired and sickened by the battle to even begin looting the bodies. Giant siege engines and overturned catering trucks lay burning everywhere, yet he gave them no heed, not even the ones with tuna sandwiches; he followed the gurney of HeyHoDen like a man in a fevered dream.     Morrie! he repeated to himself. I'm Morrie! Not Otto. Morrie! What's the alternative? Go back to being a janitor for the rest of my life when there's an opportunity to become somebody important? I don't understand how the hell it happened, but it doesn't matter. I'm Morrie! Not Otto. I've got to learn more about my adventurous new life. Wow, this city sure looks beat up. I wonder if this is where I live.     The small party passed its way across the field and through the great Gates of Minas Tirith, which were twisted and crumpled like defective aluminum cans. Strings of "E" tickets from the ruined ticket booth coiled across the roadway, and Otto, deep in thought, tripped over them and fell into an alley. When he righted himself and found his way back to the main road HeyHoDen's procession was gone. He stumbled his way through the ashen streets at random, hoping to regain sight of his party, or perhaps a bar somewhere, or maybe a mailbox with his name on it.     "Morrie!" a voice called out to him.     He turned around. A small figure, like a child but wearing the livery of Gondor and no pants, came out of a side-street and dashed up to him. "Morrie!" the figure said again. "Is it really you?"     "Ja," Otto replied, then tried harder to mask his Scandinavian accent. "Uh, yeah," he attempted again gamely. "Frog in my throat. Sorry. Uh. Do I know you?"     "Oh, thank Eru!" Pipsqueak continued, unhearing in his anxiety. "I had hoped I might find you! It's Gandalf! Do you remember Isengard?"     "Oh, ja, ja," Otto blurted out automatically. "Gandalf! Isengard. Remember all about that, meeting you there. Yes, sir. Isengard! Remember it just like it was yesterday."     "You do?" Pipsqueak said. "Oh, good! That's good! I was scared I was the only one who remembered!"     "Nope," Otto said quickly. "Like the back of my hand. Perfect memory. Uhm. So, how've you been, then, Gandalf? Long time since Isengard. Lot of water under the bridge."     "Oh, I've got so much to tell you! But you must have been in the battle. You look terrible!"     "No, I feel fine," Otto replied.     "You look at least a foot taller."     "Uh, no, just new shoes."     "And you've grown a beard."     "Uhm. Accident. Wrong bottle. Rogaine instead of aftershave. That's all."     "And it looks like somebody belted you with a heavy mail glove."     Otto paused. "Well. Uh. Yeah. Yeah, that did sort of happen," he conceded.     Pipsqueak took Otto, soon to be Morrie, by the arm. "I've got to get you to the Houses of Healing," he said. "There you can rest, and we can compare notes about Gandalf. But be careful! He's around, you know, and he has spies everywhere."     "But I thought you-" Morrie began, then stopped himself. He was beginning to feel somewhat disoriented. He allowed the stranger to guide him further and further into the City, past small pocket gardens and numerous aging gift-shops, towards the Houses of Healing. He was lightheaded from the smoke and confused about the identity of the person leading him; and someone named Gandalf was around, and had spies everywhere, which didn't sound too promising as a beginning to a new life. This Morrie thing, he realized, was going to take a little more effort than he had thought. Maybe having a quick lie down wasn't such a bad idea after all.     So it was that Morrie lay in the Houses of Healing, with Pipsqueak keping watch by his side. Gandalf knew this, but not knowing of Pipsqueak's recovered memory he deemed it unimportant. Other, more urgent matters were on his mind. "What do you mean, you don't know where Ariellë is?" he demanded of the nurses. "She was grievously wounded. Near death. They'd bring her here, right? There isn't another Houses of Healing run by another Guild or something, is there?"     "Och, nay, sir," replied the oldest of the women, "the Houses o' Healin' are the only healers, sir, and have been for many long years, what with our having cornered the market on rare herbs an' folklore an' wool blankets an' whatnot, it's a surety ye'll naught be findin' any caregivers other than those o' the Houses o' Healin', an' we run all the franchises an' the little stores what where visitors might be gainin' a foot-plaster or an aspirin or a Band-Aid for when they might have hurts their tootsies walkin' all day or fallin' off a ride, for the Houses ha'e done made the City a warm an' hospitable place for many an Age, an' are one of the few places in these latter days to consistently show a profit-"     "Spare me your fiscal analysis, Iorritant," Gandalf cut in with a wave of his arm, "and your horribly-overdone dialect as well. I've already been through the morgue, and I've inspected the ruins of the House of the Stewards, and she's not dead in either place. If she's not dead, then where the hell is she? Last I saw of her, she wasn't exactly fit to go hang-gliding or deep-sea-oyster collecting. If she's alive, I've got to find her before she can recover! Uh, so I can help her recover, of course."     "Och, nae, nae, good Gandalph," Iorritant began again. "For there is no competition to the Houses o' Healin', like I've sayed. An' there hasn't been in long centuries, nae, not since there was a King in Gondor, for they say the King could heal warts an' make penicillin out o' epoxy an' the like. For The Hands Of A King Are The Hands Of A Healer, the old legends say, an' everyone believes it because it's all capitalized like that an' everything-"     At this Gandalf jumped up suddenly. "Men may long remember your words, Iorritant," he grinned, shaking her hand eagerly and then grabbing his hat. "The fools. Ha ha ha haaa! Wait right here! I'll be right back. And keep the loremasters nearby! I want plenty of witnesses handy!"     Aragon sat in his little pup-tent with Eonard, sharing a bottle of Dunland Slugger's they had found on the field of battle and drinking to the fallen. "But what I still don't unnerstand," Eonard slurred slightly, "is why we're out here in th's Eruforsaken pup-tent when you're supposed to be th' ruler of this whole damn City."     "I deem the time unripe," Aragon said, pronouncing the syllables with grave emphasis. "It would not be well to enter this City while the Stewards still reign, for it would divide the City's loyalities in this its moment of trial. Also the reigning Steward might have me thrown in the dungeon for a century. When Dr Faramir rules the City in peace, however, then shall I make my lineage and my Certificate of Authenticity known to all."     "'S good idea," Eonard agreed, once again taking a draught from the bottle. "'S'noble."     Aragon nodded and reached for the bottle when an arm clad all in white reached through the tent-flap and yanked him by the lapels. "Come on," Gandalf growled in a large stage-whisper. "We've got the opportunity of a lifetime here!"     Gandalf led Aragon quickly through the darkened streets, with Eonard stumbling along somewhere behind them. "But you said I should wait until the Stewards were all out of commission," Aragon whispered. "That I not divide the people in loyalty during this time of strife and all that."     "You never do what I say anyway," Gandalf whispered back. "Listen! They've got these idiotic beliefs about the Kings of old, see? The hands of a King are the hands of a healer and like that. The Stewards haven't got anything like that, not even aspirin concessions. So all you do is do some quick healing, and whammo! Minas Tirith is our baked potato!"     "But those beliefs are true," Aragon began. "The cause of healing is noble. For in the ancient days when our people were beset by the Darkness and ringworm and foot-fungus in the days of Numenor the great King Tar-Palindrome went forth and invented ointment and-"     "Look, forget ointment. Forget noble for a minute," Gandalf interrupted. "Just think healing, okay? One or two quick heals and we'll be on top of the oyster, whether Ariellë is alive or not."     "Ariellë?" Aragon asked, stumbling in mid-step at the name. "Not the same Ariellë who-"     "No! That was somebody else! She's nobody," Gandalf sneered. "Look. Forget it. You just do some Kingly-type healing, okay? Let me take care of the rest."     Soon later they were led to Faramir's chamber. The Doctor lay on his back in the small stifling room, pierced by the many nightmarish wounds of the Black Helicopters and a single, conspicuously ordinary knife-wound in his back. Aragon knelt by the bed while Gandalf stood nearby, making sure there was a crowd of witnesses just outside the door. "My lord Faramir is hurt most grievous," the aging Loremaster intoned through false teeth. "He is suffering from what the Atlanteans once referred to as feagurth, or mortalius in the Northern dialects, sometimes called spirgrache in Edoran, or kifo-smyerte in the Russo-Swahili, or ilbloob-looblooblOObb to the Betelgeusean-"     "What you're saying," Aragon interrupted pointedly, "is that he's dead."     "Uh, well, yes," the Loremaster replied, "not to put too fine a point on it. Actually, he was already dead when we brought him in this morning."     "Then why," Aragon asked angrily, "have you put him in a bed?"     "Uh. Well." The Loremaster had the decency to look embarassed. "Well, y'see, his health insurance still had some credits on it, what with him being a member of the Family of Stewards and all, and, well, we figured that, what with one thing and another, with all these heating bills to pay, if we gave him a room for a few days we could charge him for it and-"     "Say no more!" Aragon said, appalled. "Oh, there's going to be some reorganization when I come into power-"     "Look, forget that," Gandalf cut in, stepping in hastily and rubbing Aragon's shoulders like a coach readying a prize boxer. "Time for all that later. Time to heal, okay? Get in there and heal!"     Aragon nodded and went to the bed. For a time all was silent. Aragon knelt by the body and hummed a quiet mournful tune, just on the edge of hearing, which brought to those nearby a vision of green fields and gentle spring breezes and Willie Nelson. Then he put a hand upon Faramir's brow and whispered, "Doctor Faramir! The King commands. Come back! Come back, Faramir!"     For an hour and yet another the vigil went on. Aragon's voice slowly grew quieter, and it seemed to those watching that he was wandering in some faraway country, searching for Faramir, looking under invisible rocks and draining unseen bogs, and at last whittling a megaphone out of some unseen wood so that he could shout further. Gradually more and more of the Healers stopped in the doorway and stood in amaze, chiefly because once they showed up Gandalf refused to let them leave. Then, just as the observers were being driven to the end of their patience, Aragon stood. It seemed to those nearby that he looked as one fatigued by a long struggle, for his face was grey, and he had a leg cramp. He looked hard upon Dr Faramir's peaceful and quiet features, and sighed; and finally he looked to Gandalf and the Loremaster, who anxiously awaited his pronouncement.     "Uh, you're right," Aragon said simply. "He's dead, all right. No question."     The faces of the Healers were alight with amazement, not to mention anger, with some sheer frothing annoyance thrown in for good measure. Among their grumbles and yells could be heard the shrill highly-pitched rodent trap of a voice which was Iorritant's. "'Cor, what a bloody waste of time that was," she exploded. "Some 'ealer that one turned out to be! About as useful as eggplant in a snowstorm, that one. 'E's even worse than Reaver. Remember ol' Reaver and that amputation 'e did for that case o' the chills-"     "Shut up! Shut up!" screamed Gandalf, overriding the din. "Okay, bad example, I admit. But the guy was already dead, okay? Look, let's go to someone who's just grievously wounded this time."    Eowynn lay silent and unmoving, her eyes gazing up at the ceiling. Her face was deathly white except for a red mark upon her temple which strongly resembled the emblem on Morrie's helmet. Eonard stood beside the bed, distraught both by the emptiness of his sister's eyes and the more poignant emptiness of his bottle. "She was found on the field near HeyHoDen," the Loremaster garbled. "Though she was merely hit by some wayward soldier's helm, she will not awaken. I fear there is some greater mischief at work. We have been unable to give her aid, largely due to fear of heightened malpractice premiums."     "Greater evils are at work here," Aragon explained. "For who among mortals could yank the Black Underwear and not take grievous hurt? And yet there is more here than this one day's sorrow. Is that not so, Eonard?"     "Indeed, yes, lord Arag'n," Eonard replied almost soberly. "For she was grown disgusted with Edoras, and the foul enchantments o' Wormbreath were upon her, and her name has been arbitrarily changed every time she's appeared in a chapter. And being trampled by King HeyHoDen's honor guard when they were picking up the King's body probably didn't help either."    Aragon nodded, and again knelt by the body. He watched her quietly for some time, particularly her breasts which held his attention for a great while. Then, evidently satisfied that she really was breathing, he muttered a low incantation and drew from his pouch some thin green leaves, which he broke in his hands and dropped into a bowl of water. A sharp smell of basil filled the room, tangy and refreshing. Aragon followed it up with some garlic, fresh tomatoes, dill, finely diced onion and a touch of ginger. He sent someone for Ricotta cheese and some fettucini. Then he called softly to Eowynn, saying there would be Italian food and that she would miss it all if she slept through it. He called her by her many names: Eowynn, Eowinnie, Eowynifred, Dirthead, Hey You In The Back With The Eyeliner. He touched her brow and held her hand. He would have given her a vigorous chest massage if there hadn't been so many people standing around. Finally in desperation he stood up and slapped her very hard, several times, whilst screaming her name. Eonard then grabbed his arm and shot him a glance which looked remarkably sober. He stopped. He nodded.     "It is not right for me to wake her," Aragon wisely observed. "For her brother should perform that honour. It would only grieve Eowinnie to wake up to see me: virile, manly, yet unavailable. Nope, nope, no no no; the Right and Noble course is to leave Eowynn in Eonard's capable hands!" And just as the assembled witnesses began to howl in protest Aragon beat a hasty retreat out of the chamber, Gandalf following mere inches behind him.     Boromir lay groggily, fevered and wounded, and still smelling of seaweed. "His case is most grave," the Loremaster monotonously droned, annoyed that he was being given all the exposition. "Between the mumak, the near-drowning, the coral reef and the barnacles, his case is most bitter indeed. Not that the king couldn't handle it, of course," he added, with a vituperative look at Aragon.     "Fear not!" Gandalf said airily. "Piece of cake." Moving closer to the worried Aragon, he quietly added: "No problem here. You already resurrected him back in Chapter Two. And do you know how many times he's been killed already? Hell, this man won't stay dead even if you drive a spike through his chest. You could electrocute this man with twenty thousand volts, cut his body into tiny little pieces, soak them in acid and fling them into mighty Anduin and then invalidate his trademark and he'd still recover before the ink was dry on the page! Trust me, I've seen it happen." Aragon nodded once and made for Boromir, and had scarcely touched his arm before the Great Man of Gondor bellowed:     "AaaarrowwwwphnagaaaaooooooOOOWWWWwwwwwwwwww!"and immediately convulsed, fell heavily on his face on the floor, and lay still.     There was a long silence.     "So, uhm... is he cured, then?" Gandalf asked.     "Owww, 'e's not breathin'!" Iorritant began to squall, in a voice shrill and loud enough to be heard over half of Gondor despite Gandalf's sudden urgent attempts to shush her. "That Aragon bloke 'as killed that nice Mr Boromir! Och, now that's as incompetent a job o' healin' as Oi've ever seen in all me days. And to think that Gandalph thought 'e could heal people better than us! And wasted our entire evening! 'Cor, what a pig! It's good work 'e couldn't find Ariellë; an' he was lookin' for her, mind you. About as adept a healer as hittin' yourself on the foot with a big rock, I says." This Iorritant said and much much more besides, and the rumour of Aragon's incompetence and Gandalf's stupidity was carried through the night as if by public-relations agents being paid by the word.     Pipsqueak, already nervous, jumped about a foot when Gandalf and Aragon suddenly thrust open the door and pushed their way in; but thinking quickly he pretended he was just worried about the sleeping Morrie. "There's something different about him," the hobbit explained, desperately trying to avoid Gandalf's eyes. "He's been talking in his sleep, which isn't Morrie at all; and he's been saying things about brooms and window cleaner and ordering new mop-heads before the morrow." And as Gandalf and Aragon turned to the bed he took one last apologetic glance at Morrie, slipped quickly out the door and ran into the night.     "It may be the blow to his head has harmed his mind," Aragon intoned. He reached over to touch Morrie's brow and said in a commanding voice: "Moribund Brandybottle. Awake!"     "Ja, ja," Morrie said immediately, opening his eyes easily. "Morrie! That's me. What d'you need, mister?"     "Ah-HA!" Aragon laughed, turning quickly to the doorway; but there were no witnesses, as Gandalf could no longer restrain them after the Boromir incident. With a sigh he returned to Morrie and held up a hand. "How many fingers?" he asked.     "All of them," Morrie replied cleverly.     "How's your memory? Forget anything? Names? Debts?" Aragon continued.     "Hah! Not me," Morrie happily told the strangers. "Mind like a steel trap. I remember everything."     Gandalf, who had only been listening with half an ear, suddenly was all attention. "Everything?" he asked, his expression dark. "You remember everything?"     "Ja, ja," Morrie replied happily. "Everything. Perfect. Clear as a bell."     "Including Isengard?" Gandalf demanded.     "Oh, ja!" Morrie grinned. "I was just thinking about Isengard. I remember the whole thing! Top to bottom. No memory lapse there."     "Ah. Well, that's good to know," Gandalf said airily. He proceeded to the door. "Guard!" he yelled. "This Halfling has the Plague. Put him in an isolation tank and allow absolutely no one to speak to him!"     "Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn," Gandalf groused a moment later in the deserted hallway. "You really botched that job up. Not even Boromir! My Eru, my dog could resurrect Boromir. A guy can't keep Boromir from being resurrected. But you just look at him, and whammo! Fit for burial! You stupid, toadying imbecile." He opened a chamber door at random and they stepped in.     "I healed the halfling," Aragon pointed out.     "I wish you'd healed him like the others," Gandalf snapped irritably.     "I don't understand," Aragon mumbled. "These are the hands of a King. They should have healed! What went wrong, I wonder? Was it the pressure? Too many witnesses? Performance anxiety? It's a good thing I don't work in porn films."     "I don't know how the hell I'm going to get you installed as King now. You stupid bastard." Gandalf sat down on the bed and was greeted by a scream of pain from a soldier with a broken leg. Aragon rolled his eyes in exasperation and grabbed the man by the lapels with one regal hand.     "You. Get out. We're talking."     "Yes, my Liege," the soldier said, jumping up and walking out quickly.     "Absolutely incompetent. Absolutely bloody incompetent," Gandalf went on, not noticing, angrily concentrating on lighting his pipe. "Now if you'd tried to heal Ariellë, that might have worked in our favour. But she's still out there somewhere, damn it, and so we need a new plan." The match broke in his hands and a burning fragment skittered across the floor. "New plan. Totally different angle. Like... damn, that was my last match. Have you got a match?" He looked at Aragon and then strode angrily out to the hallway. "Hasn't somebody in this Eruforsaken dump got a fucking match?" he screamed at the top of his lungs; and his voice echoed and reverberated off the stone walls.     "You've got the Ring of Fire," Aragon reminded him quietly.     "Yeah, but it needs a new flint," Gandalf grumbled. "Okay. Healing wasn't it. But we've got to get you doing something Kingly, or else you'll never be accepted by this rabble. Damn it. We need a new plan."
  Pipsqueak woke up from a deep sleep, thinking he had heard somebody callhis name. As he lay there in the darkness, he heard it again: Paragraph Took,hear my voice! At first he thought it was Gandalf, but this voice wasdifferent; it was full of warmth, love, and sympathy, so much unlikeGandalf's nervous babbling. This voice spoke the truth and Pipsqueak wouldlisten to it and obey what it would command.  Beware! Gandalf has betrayed you all. Frodo must not be allowed tocomplete his mission, and you are the only one who can stop him. Find anEagle whose heart is pure, and fly to Mount Doom. You must stop Frodo at allcost; for if you don't, all of Muddle-Earth will fall into darkness!  "Sss... uh, Aruman??" whispered Pipsqueak with trembling voice. He sprangup, but there was nobody at the room, but as an echo he still could hear:Even the smelliest personnnnn...  Hand in hand, like lovers do, giggling Giggly and leggy Lego-Lass waltzedinto the City, after morning came; for she wanted to do some shopping, andfolk that saw them pass marvelled to see such an open display of inter-racial affection; for long had Minas Tirith been yoked by a strictmoral code of the Stewards.  "There are endless lines of toy-stores here," said Giggly looking around."But none for the adults, if you know what I mean. When Aragon takes over, Iwill talk to him about opening a chain of erotic-shops, selling finesthandmade Dwarvish instruments of pleasure."  "They need more strip-clubs and escort-services too," said Lego-Lass."When Aragon liberates the City, the people of the Wood will send to himtheir best exotic dancers, and courtesans who won't hesitate in performingany act."  Their casual conversation was interrupted by Arwen, who came running afterthem. "Where the hell is my beloved Aragon?!" she said. "He's nowhere in thecamp, and his bed hasn't been slept on whole night! That bastard better havea good explanation for this." The warrior maiden was unconsciously squeezingher sabre-hilt with her knuckles white.  "Hard to say," said Lego-Lass with false sincerity. "Is there anall-you-can-eat buffet anywhere nearby?" Giggly giggled uncontrollably, andArwen gave a menacing glance to the grinning Elven-maid. "Ok, ok. Justkidding," she continued. "I think he's with Gandalf. They seemed to haveplanned to hold some kind of meeting at the conference-room on the top-floorof the Tower. Gandalf specifically warned everybody not to tell you..."  "That treacherous Wizard is up to no good again!" Arwen bit her lip. Thenthe expression in her face brightened. "If I stop his evil plans, I canstill be the hero of the third movie!" With this she leaped up and rushedaway, pushing surprised guards aside.  "She's such a bitch!" said Lego-Lass. "I hate her, I really do."  "Never mind that," said Giggly. "Come over here and tell me who youlike!"  They were standing outside the ancient citadel where once great film-moguls had dwelled, and the morning-sun shone upon them. The air ofthis sacred place seemed to be filled with history and memories of theglorious days of yore, which seemed to demand respect and quiet awe.  "Take me, Giggly," cried Lego-Lass. "Right here at the heart of the oldMagic Kingdom!"  And he took her, and he cared not that they were on an open place in thesight of many. And many indeed saw them, and even more heard the noises theywere making as they plighted their troth and were glad until the guards cameand arrested them for Public Naughtiness.  The Dwarf and the She-Elf were taken to the guardhouse, where they weregiven their one errand-call and then locked in the Cell of Poor Hygiene.When Lego-Lass looked out of the small window of their cell, she could seestrange things flocking around the empty marketplace, pecking a toscansalami.  "Look!" she cried. "Goons! They are far from Studio 5. A wonder they areto me, and an annoyment such as I never have felt. Alas! For the goons andtheir yin-tong cries. No peace shall I have again in mortal lands."  She sighed, and sitting down on a bench covered with filthy hay, began tosing softly:    There's a song that I recall, my Mother sang to me    She sang it as she tucked me in, when I was ninety-three...  She was interrupted by a guard banging the door. "Shut up in there, youbum!" he shouted. "Your lawyer is here to see you."  "Ai-ai!" said Lego-Lass.  The guard opened the door, and in walked a small, hooded figure. Dwarf andElf looked at the hooded stranger with amazement. "Leave us!" he told theguard, with a voice that for some reason sent shivers through theirintestines. The Guard grumbled but snatched the silver coin the strangertossed to him, and closed the door behind him. The stranger turned to thetwo friends and removed his hood dramatically.  "Oh, it's you, Morrie," said Giggly. "What brings you here?"  "Don't mention that name here!" said Morrie, and a shadow of nervousnesspassed by his face as he glanced at the door. "The name of Brandybuck isfeared and loathed widely in these lands, and someone might recognise me.While we are here, my name is Mr. Moriarty, a local solicitor."  "Sure, whatever," said Lego-Lass. "Say... weren't you supposed to be afoot taller then before and have a beard? Just something I overheard at thecampfire."  "Naah. That's just some guy I suckered to come over here as a decoy, sothat my disappearance wouldn't arouse too much attention. As he is nowsafely locked away, I have free hands to carry out my masterplan without anyinterruptions. And you can help me with that. You like money, don't you?"  Lego-Lass and Giggly looked at each other. In their dreams they couldalready picture themselves sharing a luxurious dream-house on one of theparadise-islands of the Tampalas Bay, all paid up with dirty drug-money...  "We're in!" they said in unison.  "Great," said Morrie, or Mr. Moriarty as he was now called. "Just wait abit, and I'll get you out of here." He knocked on the door, and the guardopened it.  "Aww, now I didn't get to tell about our journey through the Paths ofLiving, and the tragic misfortune that came over Boromir," sighedLego-Lass.  "Good thing too," said Giggly. "For upon that road I was put to shame:Giggly Groin's son, who had deemed himself having a stronger bladder thenany Men or Elf..."  "I admit, the Ancient Toons were hilarious to look upon," saidLego-Lass. "And with Boromir walking ahead of them with his new face,there was no friend nor enemy who would not fall to the ground convulsedwith laughter, save Lord Droopdawg of Lamedog, who remained in seriousmelancholy. Perhaps the stories are true, and he is partly a toon himself.But the Pirates of Tampalas would have gotten away, had it not been forBoromir, who got hold of their ship and formed a living bridge, allowingthe rest of us to charge over his back and into the ship. But alas! Aragonand his Mumak were too much for him to bear. I hope he's getting betternow."  "I see no reason why not," replied Giggly.  Presently the Captains were starting their debate, high above the commonriff-raff, at the Tower of Ethel. All the remaining nobles of Gondorwere present, as were the twin-sons of El-Rond; and Aragon who presentedhimself as an already crowned King even though presently that was not yetaccepted in any way by many of those who were present. But it was Gandalfwho presented the first presenting.  "My lords," said Gandalf to those who were present, "listen to the wordsof the Steward of Gondor before he died, in which I had no part:Gandalf is a great guy. He's so wise and so noble, and wants only goodthings for Gondor. If should it happen that I lose my mind and killmyself, in which he will have no part, he should be put in charge andeveryone should just do whatever he says. I would like you all to know thatwith heavy heart I accept this gravest duty."  This aroused some angry murmur from the side of the nobles of Gondor.Dr. Imrahil and his twin brother Prince Armadillo® (of whom nobody couldremember which one was evil) both sprang up ready to object when Aragonslammed down Endurit, cleaving the table in half. The nobles went quiet,and Gandalf continued. "Good. That is settled then. I shall rule you all inthe days that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy. Now! Despitewhatever others may have told you, it is obvious that we have no hope to standagainst Sauron with arms. Sooner or later his overwhelming armies wouldcrush us no matter what we do. Resistance is futile, you know..."  "Then you wish we would just give in to Sauron??" said Hurly the Keymasterand his twin-brother Curly the Backdoor-Master simultaneously.  "Uh, basically yes," said Gandalf. "The only way for us to proceed isunconditional surrender. And as a token of our good will, all the noblesof Gondor shall be given to Sauron as hostages who will be executed ifwe don't agree to whatever he demands."  "Don't worry," he continued, grinning evilly at their shocked faces. "KingAragon and myself will see that everything goes well while you're away. Haveno fear. This is only a cunning ploy to buy time for the Ringbearer tofinish his task. When Sauron is destroyed, you all shall be heroes!Posthumous Heroes, with any luck... Whoops, did I say that out loud?"  So powerful was the effect of Gandalf's voice that the nobles actuallystarted leaning toward his suggestions, when suddenly the door was slammedopen, and in walked three incredibly sexy females followed by a hooded man.Gandalf gazed in terror at Ariellë, but before he could say anything Eowynnspoke up, directing her words at Aragon.  "All these years, father!" she said. "Why didn't you tell me? Why??"  "Oh, I don't think he knows about it," explained Arwen, as if theexpression in Aragon's face would not make this painfully obvious. "El Rondmanaged to hide it from everybody. Except me of course. But it is true.Eowynn is your daughter, Aragon. Perhaps you remember the days you spentboozing in Edoras some twenty years ago? The one night you ended up passingout next to your drinking-buddy Eomondo's horny young wife, and woke up nextmorning feeling dirty? Eowynn got started that night, although you are notto blame.  "But there is more," continued Arwen. "Ariellë is your twin sister. Youwere separated when young, for your own protection. Ariellë was placed inSteward's family so that she could get the best possible Gondorianupbringing. You, on the other hand, ended up on that pig-farm of Butterball'shalf-brother where Dad found you... And since Ariellë is a few minutesolder then you, it is she who is the rightful Heir of Isildur and the newruler of Gondor."  "Do something!" whispered Gandalf to Aragon, but all he could do was tostare from Ariellë to Eowynn and back while mumbling "She's my sister,she's my daughter. She's my sister, she's my daughter..." over and overagain.  "This is ridiculous!" cried Gandalf himself. "Where's your proof?"  "Right here!" said Arwen and pointed to the cloaked figure. The manremoved his hood, and lol! it was Boromir. Boromir as he should be;alive and well, more goofy-faced then ever.  "Hands of the King are hands of the healer," said Arwen. "Ariellëresurrected him in the presence of many witnesses. She is the rightful Queenof Gondor!"  The nobles cheered and looked relieved.  "What commands the Queen?" asked Arwen smiling and touched Ariellë's armgently.  "As Aragon has begun, so I will go on," said Ariellë. "Let none nowreject the counsels of Gandalf, whose long labours come at last to test. Wewill make a peace with Sauron - a honest and fair, mutually satisfactorypeace, with no hidden agenda. We will find a way for Culture andEntertainment to co-exist, and Capitalism to flourish alongside socialwelfare and respect for the nature: what Aruman called the Third Path. Nowprepare yourself, for tomorrow we shall all march to the great PeaceConference at the Black Gate!"  The nobles cheered again, and Gandalf looked on with sour face as theyfollowed Ariellë out of the room. Eonard lead the still-weeping Eowynn bythe hand, and he gave Aragon a nasty look as they went by him. And it seemedthat even the sons of El Rond were abandoning him. At least Arwen stillloves me, thought Aragon to himself as she stopped at the door and turnedto speak to him.  "Did I mention that I am breaking off our engagement?" she said. "Alas,you have somewhat lost your charm lately, and now you have lost your Kingdomtoo. It would seem that Ariellë is the most powerful lesbian in town now, soI guess I'll be taking my chances with her. Toodle-oo!"  Gandalf and Aragon were left alone in the room. Aragon was sobbing quietlyand munching his comfort-choklit. "No need to worry," said Gandalf bitinghis lip. "There will be no peace after Frodo destroys the Ring." Aragonlooked at him, surprised.  "You see, the Ring contains Sauron's Mojo," explained Gandalf, "and withhis Mojo out of the way he will lose any interest in music, arts andlovemaking; and then he'll be able to concentrate on being the Evil DarkLord as he is supposed to! When that happens, Ariellë will look like a foolor a traitor. And who then will the people turn to? They will turn to us!"  Gandalf laughed diabolically, and the look on his face was so evil thatAragon begun to move away from him. But Gandalf grasped him by the shirt.  "It's too late to back off now," he said. "You're in this too deep already.Besides, you shall see that Arwen will come crawling back, when you are madethe King. You better just stick with me..."  Suddenly he let go and turned around. Boromir had appeared to thedoorway. "So that's your plan, eh?" he said. "You would use the threat ofSauron to keep the West under your control, and use all of us as yoursockpuppets! Well I will be no Wizard's tool! I'm telling everyone aboutyou!"  "Sure. Go ahead, I won't stop you," said Gandalf. "I know when the game islost... Oh, one thing. Before you go, how about you take a look out of thewindow?"  "I don't mind if I do," said Boromir.  From his hideout, Pipsqueak watched in terror as Gandalf casually pushedBoromir out of the window. As Boromir's cry broke down to a loudthump, Gandalf turned to Aragon and said: "Let us hurry! If we get to himfirst, you can try resurrecting him one more time!"  As they left the room, Pipsqueak crawled out of his hiding place and stoodtrembling in the middle of the room. "Aruman was right all along!" hethought to himself. "And now I'm the only one who knows the truth. But whatcan I do? Where will I find courage? I can't go on alone..."  And again he heard, like a whisper in the wind, a voice from another placeand another time.  Yogurt will always be with you...
   "Arwen!  Arwen!"  A rapidly approaching hobbitish voice accompaniedby the absence of the flapping of bare feet on the flagged street madethe Elf-maiden turn.  It was Pipsqueak.   "Arwen!  I must talk to you.  Someplace where you-know-who can'toverhear us."   "Very well.  First you can tell me what you're on.  Why aren't yourfeet touching the ground?"   "Morrie and I had Ment-draught in Fungang.  We've been hovering likethis ever since.  Didn't you notice at Isengard?  Look-"   "Last I saw Morrie he was not hovering.  Houses of Healing, as theymarched him into quarantine.  He was a foot or two taller than you buthis feet were on the ground."   "..."  Pipsqueak suddenly looked puzzled.  "Now you mention it, therewas something different about him after he came in from the battle.That too, now you mention it.  Well, no matter.  Probably just hiswounds.  Look-"   "In here."   As they stood in a deserted old souvenir shop, Arwen turned her gazeupon the squeaky hobbit.  "Well?"   "It's Gandalf.  He's up to no good.  He-"   Drily: "I had noticed."   "He-killed-Aruman-he-killed-Boromir-he-wants-to-kill-Ariellë.He-wants-Sauron's-Ring-destroyed-but-this-will-only-turn-Sauron-evil-again-he-"   "Woah!  Slow down, Pitya.  He killed Aruman?"  She fixed her intensegaze on the little one.   Pipsqueak explained, suddenly calm and focussed.  Arwen's gaze grewmore intense.   She said: "I was there.  I have blurred memories of that day, but Idon't remember him killing Aruman.  I remember Aruman deserving it."   "I remember better than you.  I had a memory freshener whenDenethor put Gandalf to trial.  I saw all on Denethor'slaptop Palantarium.  Then Gandalf threw a smoke grenade, killed all butme, and made an explosion to cover up the evidence.  He thinks I'veforgotten all of that, or I should be dead now.  Think back, Arwen,think back!  Remember his expertise with drugs, and remember that hepassed a bottle round among us."   There was a pause.  Arwen's gaze grew distant, then pained.  Then ithardened.  And hardened.  And hardened even more, until she looked moreperilous than Pipsqueak had ever seen the warrior maiden before.Suddenly, remembering his childhood, he wished fervently that Arwen hadbeen his mother ---   --- for a moment he had that expression that children often imagineon a puppy-dog in a pet shop: adopt me!  Arwen noticed, smilinginwardly; then: not yet, you idiot, remain unfettered a whilestill ---   --- then she relaxed a smidgen and took a deep breath.   "And Boromir?"   "I saw him push Boromir out of the window.  I was hiding in theconference room where you told Aragon about his family relations."   "Then I can reassure you.  That boy is a toon.  Normal people fallingtwenty meters onto stone will turn into rattle-sacks of broken bone andblood.  I have seen it more than once in battle in the mountains.Boromir - didn't you forget the ? - made a hole in the street andclimbed up from it.  Showing his true self, finally.  I saw it.  Manydid.  But I'm not surprised that Gandalf would try.  He wants to killAriellë?"   Pipsqueak explained.   "Destroying Sauron's Ring will make him evil again?"   Pipsqueak explained.   "What more?"   "He tried to kill me, but was interrupted.  Then he tried to make meforget with magic, and he thinks that he did it.  He also killedDenethor.  I shouldn't be surprised if he is after you next."   "I should.  If he tries, the surprise shall be his.  Briefly.  IsAragon part of this?"   "Yes, at least partly.  Gandalf wants to install him as King ---"   "That is old news."   "I think Gandalf has some sort of hold on him, and he doesn't tellhim everything."   "I should think so.  The Aragon that I loved was a bit shady, butwould never have stooped to such evil."   Then Pipsqueak took a deep breath.  "Have you seen the Star Warsmovies?"   "Yes?"   "You know how Obi-wan was killed but could still advise Luke withsome sort of disembodied voice?"   "Yes."   Another deep breath.  "I think Aruman is still around in the same wayas that.  He has talked to me.  He wants me to find an eagle and send itto Mount Doom and prevent Frodo from throwing the Ring in."   A short pause.  Then: "Ah.  Leave it to me.  Pitya, you have donevery well in telling me."   "Boromir!  I thought I..."   "Killed me?  Can't be done.  Do you know what rabbits are like?  Toonrabbits are worse.  Mother knew one called Roger."   Gandalf sighed, reached into the recesses of his robes, then produceda small bottle.   "Ink eraser?"   "Yes, Aragon, ink eraser."   But when Gandalf returned his attention to Boromir, there was only aBoromir-shaped hole in the stone wall, silhouetted arms frozen inmid-flail.  Peering through it, they saw a progression of Boromir-shapedholes through the other walls clear to the outer one.  Some ball-shapeddust clouds slowly dissipated along the beeline.  A cry of meep-meepaccompanied by the sound of an engine faded into the distance towardsthe River.  Boromir would not soon warn Gondor against Gandalf.   "What's with the meep-meep," asked Aragon.  "This is a Disney placerun by a Disney-franchise family, right?"   "Toon humour."   Sitting on a stone parapet, Pipsqueak was reading.  So consumed washe that he didn't notice the figure approaching him from behind until ahand grabbed his shoulder.  "Still reading that feminist bastard,Pipkin?"   "Morrie!"  A swift look down.  "And hovering again, like me!  How didyou escape quarantine?  You never should have let Gandalf know-"   "Never stopped hovering.  It's Otto you mean, pretending to be me.Not very good at it, or he wouldn't have been in the isolation tanknow."   "Sweet Jesus!  I should have guessed!  Who is Otto?"   "Yes, you should.  Would the real Moribund Brandibuck have been soconfused?  But let the saps think the real Morrie is in the cell.  Youknow my family's rep in these parts, whatever we've done to earn it.I'm Moriarty now.  Solicitor.  See who I brought with me?"   "Yeah.  Why d-don't you do it in the road, you two?"   Pipsqueak swung his legs across the parapet and jumped down on theflags.  "Look," he whispered.   "Stop whispering.  These two love-birds are part of the plan."   "Oh are they?  Well, how far have you come?"   "Two inches away from contacting Aragon.  I need him to give me ashellfish export license from Tampala Bay to the Shire."   "Oh, I wouldn't pull Aragon into it," replied Pipsqueak.  "He is neckdeep in shit already and getting cold feet about it.  He might try to dothe righteous thing and stop you.  Just to soothe his conscience bydoing something right these days.  He would guess what you want toput into those shellfish of yours.  Or Gandalf might get wind of it.  Hewould not stop you.  He would take over.  You think your family isruthless?  They must have taken classes from Gandalf, the oldmotherfucker."   Pause.   "Pipsqueak!  What has gone into you?  Swearing?"  Morrie grinned.The love-birds blushed.  Dwarves blush by their beards stiffening, sinceso little of their facial skin can be seen.  Giggly's beard was like asteel brush.   "I've grown, Morrie.  Faens kuse i rddryppende drittfitte-"   "Point taken, if maturity is cued by adult cussing.  Which itisn't, it takes more.  What's wrong with Gandalf, that we didn't know ofbefore?"   Pipsqueak drew his breath, and let drive.   Afterwards, as the three others stood fuming, he smiled to himself.I am like a contagious virus against the wizard.  Whenever I comeacross one of those present at Aruman's death, I make them remember likeI do.   "Arwen!"   Coldly: "Yes?"   "Arwen.  Do you still want to marry a king, or a queen?"   "Yes."   Aragon sighed.  "Then you did right in ditching me.  Gandalf has aplan.  I serve in it. I'm confused.  I'm tired of it.  All this schemingand killing.  Now he wants to restart the war between Gondor andMordor.  That's why he wants the Ring melted down, if you'll believe it.Arwen, that's not the price I want to pay for the throne.  The price Iwant Gondor and its people to pay, I mean.  Shitshitshit."  Heturned and left.   Softly, Arwen called after him: "How much weight have you lost?  Isee you have lost some."   "Then you see with sharp eyes," replied Aragon without turning back."I outweigh one horse fewer than yesterday, that's all.  My appetite isgone, and I don't much miss it."   "Arwen!"   Warmly: "Yes?"   "I have thought about this.  You want to be with me when I becomequeen?"   "You will need me when you become queen."   "Two queens in one hive is trouble.  You, Arwen, cannot be thequeen's consort and not in practice be queen yourself, that is evident."   Pause.  "Yes."  Another pause.  "We would always be fighting."  Onemore pause.  A grin.  "And you would constantly lose."   Coldly: "I might lose one fight.  Then I should give an order, andlose no more fights against you."   "So you choose between me and the rule of Gondor, and you choosethe rule?  Sensible."   "Exactly.  Glad we see eye to eye.  The last two nights werepleasant, but that is not enough."   "Aragon, my boy!"   "Yes, Gandalf?"   "You have lost weight.  That is not good."   "My knees are happy with it.  So is Babar."   "Then eat Babar.  You must reach a pondus worthy of a king."   "I have weight worthy of a whole platoon of kings, and you can seeit!  A little more of this and I can outlard a whole division oflairds."   Coldly: "Consider it an order."   Even more coldly: "Give it to yourself.  The order for food.  Yoube king!"   "Aragon!"   But Aragon had turned and was leaving.  Gandalf tried to rush pasthim and face him down, but the walk around proved too far.  Then hegrabbed Aragon by the shoulder to force the fat man to turn back andface him.  He might as well have tried to turn a small planet.  Frombeyond the bulk before him he heard Aragon's voice: "Maybe I'm a toontoo.  A normal mortal could not be so fat and live."  Then, in abrighter voice: "And you have not enough eraser to be a threat to me."   "Aragon!  Hey, Aragon, wait!"   "Why?"   Arwen was far more agile than Gandalf.  She could leap onto the roofof a bus, and often had.  Twice in London.  She could even leap ontoAragon, and she did now.  For a moment she sat cross-legged on hischest.  It was like sitting on the mother of all water-beds.  "Standstill!"  Then she jumped down on the street and fixed him with her gaze.   "Do you remember the death of Aruman?"   "No.  Hm.  No-"   "Think back on that day.  Think hard."   "What day?"   "The day at Isengard, when Gandalf spoke with Aruman."   "I remember that day."  Pause.  "Sort of.  That's a funny look inyour eyes.  I haven't seen it since those distant days when you lovedme."   "There is something inside that mountain of butter that I still love.Now, if that means anything to you, remember the day at Isengard.  Thinkhard.  I have.  It pained me, and I suppose it will give you a splittingheadache as well-"   "I'll get a splitting headache, or just a split head, if I don't doas you-"   "No joking, Aragon!  Just do as I say!  Please!"   "Please?  From you?  Then this must be important indeed!"   "It is."   Aragon stood still.  He even ceased to wobble after a while.  Then heclasped Endurit.   "There is more," said Arwen.  "I have it from Pipsqueak."  Sheexplained.  Aragon drew Endurit.   "I'll trim down.  The lard from me by dieting and the lard from acertain wizard with Endurit!"   "Excellent.  But first things first.  I have a plan.  I must leaveyou for a while, east."   "I think we should simply cut Gandalf's head off.  But wait.  I needto trim down before I'm physically fit for it.  One reason why he wantsme to be fat, I think.  I bet it's his fault.  At any rate, he has manyweapons.  A direct assault on him may end in disaster."   "It is not Gandalf's fault that you are so fat, nor your own.  Hejust took advantage of it.  But pretend that you don't know thesethings.  Play along.  I have a plan for Gandalf too."  She laughed, andfor a moment her eyes shone with an oily green.   And so the plans of the forces of Good and the forces of Shady butBasically Decent (Plus Morrie) ripened.  Ariellë was contacted, and allknowledge shared with her.  With the upcoming peace-conference withSauron and Arwen hunting east for the Ring, the future looked bright.Even Morrie, who knew a powerful rival when he saw one, was on theanti-Gandalf team.  Also he realized now that it was probably not Arumanwho had supplied Lotho with the machine guns that theSackville-Bagginses had killed Norbert and Clovis with, but Gandalf.   Yet the plots and schemes of Mesprendeur Valóma the Crafty were notso easily defeated.  Many were his contacts in the East.  Many were theflokarinos that he sent secretly east as bribes.  Many were theblackmailing letters that went the same way.  He may have lost part ofhis power in the City, and more of it than he realized, yet he was notimpotent - save perhaps in the biological sense.  Two days later camethe message from Mordor that there would be no peace.  Whether Sauronhimself sent the message or someone else did without his knowledge andconsent this chapter does not tell, though a hint will be provided.  Inany event Ariellë's plan for a peace conference at the Gates of Mordorwas shattered.  The Armies of the West prepared for war.  Gandalf ledthe War Council.  It was very short:   "We shall march to the Black Gate.  There we shall hold Ariellë'speace conference.  We shall make peace, and we shall make it with ourblades!  Let Ariellë stay home and do her knitting!  King Aragon shalllead us."  Pipsqueak also had to go, by Gandalf's order.  Gandalf didnot know that Pipsqueak's reluctance was feigned: ere she left, Arwenhad told him that she had a plan for the disposal of the wizard, and hemust be present when it came to fruition.   Aragon, hearing Pipsqueak's voice, turned in surprise.  He recognizedit easily, but it was not as squeaky as it had been.   "Aragon, why is this chapter called 'The Back Orifice Opens'?"   Aragon patted his sword.  "We intend to hack our way through thegate."  Then he looked up, puzzled at the groans of the readers.   As the armies made ready to leave the City, Aragon tried to mountBabar the Mûmak.  But he could not.  The Mûmak knelt down, but withAragon on its shoulders it could not rise.  Nor could there be found orswiftly constructed a scaffolding that would support Aragon as hemounted the standing Mûmak.   "It was an ill wind that brought me this fate.  Long have I beentired of being this huge.  Well can I understand my Arwen when she saysthat if I don't lose a landslide of stone she will uproot a certaingrove of turnips."  The others looked at him strangely at this.  Then hesighed.  "I did ask the author of this chapter to do some voodoo to trimme down fast.  The dumb shite just mumbled something about having beenburned on drastic alterations in a previous chapter."  Then he drew hissword, with customary difficulty: "You shall not be sheathed again untilI can see my toes!"   "Until you are slim again to be able to," came the snicker fromMorrie.   "That too," replied Aragon.  "Be careful how you tease me, mobster.I can roll onto you.  I may be too soft to crush you, though my weightis easily mastodontic enough, but I may smother you."  He smiled.  Heknew that he was on the right path: even the day before, he had weighedmore than Babar.  Now he did not.  He reached out and down and pattedMorrie on the shoulder.  A little later the Armies of the West begantheir eastward march, Babar happily carrying no weight beyond his own.   The last that Pipsqueak saw of Morrie's face was eyes brimming withuncharacteristic tears.  This was some moments after Aragon had pattedhis shoulder.  The Mobster was clutching something beneath his tunic,though so innocuously that only the experienced eye of his youngercousin noticed.  Pipsqueak was absolutely befuddled.  He had never everseen his morose cousin weep before, out of courtrooms. He could guessnothing, no parting gift of any kind, that Aragon would have givenMorrie, let alone one that could have moved him in any way whatsoever.   Line after line they went, infantry of Gondor and cavalry ofRohan.  This early on the march the moods were high, and the banterbetween the two armies friendly.   "Hey, why are you wearing skirts, you women?"   "At least we're wearing something below the waistline.  Some of youstreakers don't!"   They made their first night-camp some distance past Disgiliath.  Somestragglers, eager to explore the decrepit old city of the Atlanteans,came in late and were caned.  Pipsqueak recognized the canes andshuddered.   "Hey", cried out Aragon in the evening murk.  "Where are those twobottles of Westfarthing Chinook I had?  I know I had them before we leftthe city!"  Pipsqueak wondered at this for a moment, trying to put twoand two together.  Then he smiled.  Four!  He was no longer befuddled.   It was near the end of the second day of their march from theCross-roads that they first met any offer of action.  For a smallorc-village had been spotted by the scouts a few miles upland of theRoad.  Gandalf at once gave his orders.  Six hundred men separated fromthe main body of the army and followed the wizard through the thickets,east and up.   "Hey, come here, lad!" he cried to Pipsqueak.  "Your training isn'tended yet!"  The hobbit reluctantly followed.  From a small plastic bagextracted from his extensive clothing Gandalf took a pinch of dust anddeftly inhaled it.  Pipsqueak recognized the bag and the dust.  Hestill has some of the Vala dust from Charadhras?  Or has the oldsnorter replenished it?  I wish I hadn't let the others find out aboutit when Morrie found it.   The going was swifter than might be expected in a landscape likethis: jungle, or almost so.  But the scouts knew their business.  Theyfound the swiftest way, winding round knolls, wading up creeks.  Twicethey detoured around patches of leafless forest and withered bushes ofsome kind.  "Agent Orange or something like it," Pipsqueak overheard asoldier explain to another.  "Against the coca fields.  We don't wantto pass through there!"  "Right.  Round and up."   After an hour and a half of careful march through the uplands ofEthelien they arrived at the village.  The orcs were going about theirbusiness, making ready for the night.   This is not what I expected, Pipsqueak thought.  These aremostly women and children.  I didn't know that orcs had women andchildren.  Where are their weapons?  I see one guy lugging around a bowand a quiver.  Why is that female caressing its imp?  From talk thathe overheard he realized that some of the Gondorian soldiers wereequally baffled.  Yet they surrounded the village quietly.  Many of themseemed to know their business well.  Pipsqueak grew more and moreuneasy.  "Lock and load," whispered Gandalf.  "What, our swords?" camehushed replies.   "CHAAARGE!" rang Gandalf's cry.  There was a great flapping noise inthe nearest trees; some leaves and feathers came drifting down.  TheGondorians poured their arrows into the village like a dark hail,then drew their swords and ran forward, converging.  Two of theGondorians fell with sudden shafts sticking from their chests.  Somemore fell to their own men's mis-aimed arrows.  But to the orcs it wasno use.  The three orc-men who had weapons soon looked like slicedhedgehogs.  Then the slaughter began in earnest.  When afterwardsPipsqueak followed the men back to the Road, not one orc remained alivebehind them.  But Gandalf's eyes were shining with an ecstatic light.   We shall mercifully pass the gruesome details by, save onehappenstance.  One scene burned itself into Pipsqueak's memory.  It wasa young orc-boy and an orc-girl, apparently in their late teens.  Theystood hand in hand, staring wide-eyed at the attackers.  They made noattempt to escape or defend themselves: it was no use, and they knew."Hey you!" cried Gandalf to one of the Gondorians.  "Grease thosetwo, you moron!"   "No... no..." mumbled the soldier.  Pipsqueak saw that he was weepingsoundlessly.  There was a broad smear of blood near the point of his longsword.  An orc-child lay some feet behind him, neck almost severed.  Thechild's dead hand was still clutching a small stone.   "Aah, spineless swine!" cried Gandalf.  He strode three long stepsand pushed the soldier violently to the ground.  Then he pointed hishand at the orc-pair.  Zap.  Zap.  The girl fell dead, then the boy,each with a smouldering hole in the chest: Pipsqueak was off fried baconfor months.  Gandalf started flinging his evil lightnings at theorc-children.  Zap Zap Zap.  "Get the goblin-imps too!" he cried in agreat voice, insane and happy.  "That race cannot be redeemed!  Arbeitmacht frei!  Nits make lice!"   As the party returned to the main body of the army, there were manyhowls of protest: not all the soldiers of Gondor and Rohan enjoyedthe sight of orc-heads on the tips of the spears of some of thereturning men.  Some of these heads had belonged to orc-children.   As Pipsqueak tried to fall asleep, he overheard the celebration ofthat minority of the Gondorian soldiers who had enjoyed their littleevening out. They were drinking heavily, and boasting.   I was at Srebrenica.  This was better.  We got them all this time.Gandy's not like that wimp Mladic.   Hey, I was at Tuol Sleng.  That was better.  We got thousands.  Hadtime to play, too.   Can't beat Auschwitz, you amateurs!   Heh heh, does what I did in Rwanda count?   Urg, we wuz too drunked up at Sand Creek.  Good thing I wuz soberthis time.   You aren't so sober now, are ye?   Heh heh heh.   Attaboy.   Heh heh heh heh.   ...Calley, you amateur...   ...Sabra, Shatila...   ...wading in gore...   ...what, can'tcha bend your knee?   ...heh heh heh heh...   ...Nanjing...   ...Belgian Congo...   ...more than threescore stubborn monks hewn down on the shore...   ...you are old, Viking...   ...ten captured Chinese soldiers each of us, to kill as wepleased...   ...Jerusalem...   The night that followed, and the night after that, were the blackestand most painful thus far in Pipsqueak's short life.  Theseconversations that he overheard did not improve matters.   The night after the massacre at the orc-village Pipsqueak had astrange dream.  He dreamt that he fell awake.  He could remember nodetails.  All that he remembered when he awoke from his dream was havingbeen awake, and that he hadn't enjoyed it.   Upon the sixth day from Minas Tirith they came at last to the endof the living lands.  Only parking lots and malls stretched before them,league upon ugly league.  At this horror some of the host were unmanned,already sick to the hearts with the massacre of the orc-village.   Aragon looked at them, and there was pity and understanding in hiseyes.  These were young men from Rohan, from Westfold far away, orhusbandmen from Lotstarch.  They were not made for the slaughter thatGandalf had led them into.  Nor was he, for that matter.  He quailed atthe thought of looking Arwen in the eyes.   "Go!" said Aragon.  "But keep what honour you may, and do not run!March instead quietly back to Minas Tirith, and prepare yourreports.  There will be investigations following this campaign."   "Hah!" cried Gandalf.  "Wimps!  No guts for a little bloodshed in anoble cause!  Good riddance to maggots!  Yaaah!"   Slowly the reduced army marched northwards towards the gate.  Orslowly may not be the proper word: Pipsqueak felt as if wading throughtreacle.  He could walk ten painful steps forwards and advance only afew inches.  The soldiers around him apparently experienced the same, bythe talk that he overheard.   The army made their last camp on the march, north and a little westof the Black Gate.  No enemies were to be seen, yet fear lay heavy onmost of the soldiers.  The treacle became thicker.   Suddenly Pipsqueak realized that he was no longer in the camp.  Hestood much closer to the Black Gate, together with Gandalf, Aragon,Giggly, Lego-lass, Eonard, Dr. Imrahil, Armadillo and a few others whomhe could not name because the lazy author of this chapter could not bebothered to look them up.  Without needing to be told, he knew that aparley was about to be held.  A man, richly dressed, appeared on thewall that arched above the gate.  Presenting his left side briefly tothe delegates of the West, he showed them his empty scabbard in token ofpeace.  The device of his shield was the text "Mouth of Tauron".  Thenhe spoke.  His voice was melodious.   "Well?  Why do you disturb us further?  Will you give us no peace bynight or day?"  Its tone was that of a kindly heart aggrieved byinjuries undeserved.   "But come now," the voice continued.  "Some of you at least we knowby name.  Gandalf we know too well to have much hope that he seekethcounsel here, nor forgiveness.  But thou, Aragon, lord of the Rangers ofthe North, art declared by thy well-worn travel clothes, and more by thenoble countenance of thy forefathers.  Though thy waistline surprisesus.  Why hast thou not come before, and as a friend?  Much have wedesired to see thee, especially now, to save thee from the unwise andevil counsels that beset thee!  Is it yet too late?  Despite theinjuries that have been done to our country - in which, alas! thou hasthad some part - still my lord would save thee, and hope to keep theefrom the ruin which draws closer.  Indeed he is among the few, thoughnot the only one, who has resorted from scheming and insults toinfluence thee."   Aragon opened his mouth as if to speak, but said nothing. He lookeddeep into the eyes of the Mouth standing above him, and then to Gandalfat his side; and he seemed to hesitate.  There was a silence.   It was Gandalf who broke it suddenly.  "The words of this messengerstand on their heads.  But in the language of Mordor, help means ruinand culture means glitz and clichès, that much is clear."   "Peace!" said the Mouth.  "I do not yet speak to thee, traitor toboth sides.  Pray allow me first to speak to the Ranger, whom my lordhas hopes for.   "What hast thou to say, Ranger of the North?  Wilt thou have peacewith my lord, and all the aid that his knowledge, founded in long years,can bring?  Shall we make our counsels together against evil days, andrepair our injuries with such good will as we may find?  Shall we havepeace, thou and we?  It is ours to command."   "I will have peace," Aragon answered at last, thickly and with aneffort.  All the Gondorians present cried out gladly, till Gandalflifted his hand.  "Yes, the King will have peace," he said, "he willhave peace, when you and your master and all your works have perished."Suddenly Aragon noticed a very large bottle of ink eraser in thewizard's hand, though only he realized its significance.  As theflabbergasted man on the wall above turned his gaze upon him, he onlylooked down and nodded mutely.   --- Pipsqueak's mind worked slowly and labouriously.  The treacleseemed to have reached his brain, impeding no longer only his physicalprogress.  He had a strong sense of deja vu, but he couldn't placeit ---   "You are a liar, Mouth of Sauron!" continued Gandalf.  "You speak ofpeace.  You hold out your hand to us, and I for one see only a finger onthe claw of Mordor.  Cold and cruel!  What will you say of your armiesbesieging Minas Tirith, and the incendiary bombs showering the city?When your master hangs from a gibbet for the sport of his own crows willGondor have peace with Mordor!"   The Mouth looked puzzled.  "Our armies besieging the City ofGondor?  We know of that attack, but apart from those renegadeNazdaq thou mayst be certain that Mordor had nothing to do with it.Tanks and automatic weapons were used in that attack, weren't they?Mordor has very few such weapons, and thou knowest this."   "Yeah, right.  And where did those armies come from then?" sneeredGandalf.   "Tell thou us," replied the Mouth.  "Yet we have our suspicions.  TheTurquoise Wizards that thou broughtest east, Attila and Pinafore, arestill active.  Running guns, among other things.  And we know that theNazdaq had dealings with them."   Aragon looked up.  Gandalf moved the bottle of eraser menacingly.   "Liar," he said simply.  "We will listen no more to your lies."   With that he calmly reached into his bag ---   --- Pipsqueak's sense of deja vu increased sharply ---   --- and produced a whip of many thongs.  Lashing them skywards, hecaught the Mouth of Sauron around the knees.  Then he pulled, and theMouth fell, crashing on the stone flags before his own master's gates.   As the gaudily dressed man died, Gandalf casually threw a smokegrenade at him.  The smoke covered him completely.  At the same time, agreat cry of rage rose behind the wall.  Then a breeze wafted the smoketowards the west.  The edge of the smoke cloud covered the delegation ofthe West briefly, and Pipsqueak distinctly felt a fresh and pleasantfragrance that he did not associate with Gandalf's smoke grenades.  Itcould have been the Mouth's perfume.  Then they had to retreat rapidlyfrom the gates, as the host of Mordor poured out to avenge the Mouth ofSauron and the indignity of murdering their envoy at a parley.   Blades flashed brightly in a bloody melee.  Shafts fell like fletchedsleet.  Pikes pumped like pistons, drawing water that was red.  Gandalfstrode foremost in the army of the West, lightning after lightninglashing out from his right hand.  Pipsqueak, who had often wondered atthis power of the wizard, looked closer.  He had rockets before.  Butwhat's a bloody Star Wars prop doing in this world?   In the front line of the army of the West now stood Pipsqueak, and hedidn't like it.  He was no coward, not now, but he saw men falling onboth sides, and to his mind came images of widows and orphans.  He mustput a stop to this madness.   He drew his trusty old flintlock pistol.  He did not know whence itsuddenly came; it was there, perfectly naturally.  He could not rememberusing it before, but he could remember that he had used it before.Pointing it skyward, he discharged it.  Bang!  There was no recoil,and very little gunsmoke, but he accepted this as perfectly natural.   "Stoooop!" he cried.  The nearest men glanced briefly at him.  Thatwas all.   Pipsqueak reached hurriedly for more powder, wadding and a new ball.Then: What am I doing?  If this is a dream, I have total control.  Ican do anything I want.  If I want to make it so that I have alreadyreloaded my flintlock, it will be loaded.  Without bothering to reloadthe old museum piece, he fixed its barrel between his ankles and drewthe hammer back with some difficulty.  Pointing it skyward again, hefired.  Bang!  "Stoooop!"   The nearest men glanced briefly at him.  He put the pistol back inhis belt, whence it disappeared without making its disappearancenoticed.  Perhaps a ruse would help.   "This is Mom talking to you!  You boys stop this ruckus this instant,or you'll be grounded for a year!  You're in serious trouble already,d'you hear?"   The men of the opposing armies did not hear.   An arrow, one of the thousands raining from both sides, came straighttowards Pipsqueak's face.  It parted the hair on his helmetless head ashe ducked, swiftly as the orc-chieftain in Moria in the original text.He gave up.  Let them fight, if they want to fight.  When does Arwen'splan turn up?   Then the storyline changed abruptly again.  Some of the readerspricked up their ears at that, before remembering that this is a writtentext; most shook their heads sighing.   The cry rang out in many voices: "Dragons are coming, dragons arecoming!"  The two armies stopped dead, both the living and those whowere already bleeding quietly on the tarmac.  The soldiers gaped up atthe sky, where dozens of huge shapes sped down towards them, mightyserpents with wings, black or brown contrails.  Only Gandalf remainedoblivious of them.  Zap, zap, zap went the blaster in his hand.Easterlings and Southrons continued to fall.  Then Pipsqueak saw twodragons whom he thought that he recognized.   Orm Embar and Yevaud!  Pipsqueak's mind was made up.  The slaughter must be stopped, and nowhe knew how to stop it.  He did not know what a flight of dragons ofEarthsea were doing in Muddle-earth, but he had an idea of how to makeuse of these two.  He had never thought that being a Le Guin fan wouldcome of use.   Were these Arwen's plan?  She had noticed him reading the Earthseabooks in Minas Tirith and had nodded approvingly.   He cried their Names.  His voice was little and the noise in the skywas grown great, but the dragons of Earthsea have keen ears.  They canhear the grass grow, and they can hear it on the next island on a stormyday, or so it is said.  With an air of surprised reluctance the pairarrested their rushing swoop towards the thousands of men on the ground.Pipsqueak cried to them again, remembering not to look into their oilygreen eyes.   "Orm Embar and Yevaud!  Rid me of that wizard, then of yourselves!"He pointed.  At once the two dragons turned their attention to Gandalf.These were not dragons of Muddle-earth, like Smaug and Ancalagon thatwere no more.  A dragon of Earthsea must obey one command from one whospeaks his true name; but the first part of this command was one thatpleased them.  Dragons of many western writers enjoy toying withflatlanders, these absurd and amusing little bipeds that cannot fly.  LeGuin's dragons of Earthsea are not among the exceptions.   Pipsqueak knew these things well.  "You too, Kalessin!  Noman-baiting today!"  Perhaps the dragons thought him more than a nervoushobbit with big front teeth.  In their experience it was mages who hadpowers such as being able to hover two inches above the ground.Kalessin did not seem to obey, though, merely hovering back andwatching: amused, perhaps.  Kalessin is always amused, I think, even inanger.  It must be nice.   It was then that Pipsqueak wondered how he was able to commanddragons who spoke (or bothered to speak) only the Old Speech ofEarthsea, when he spoke in Westron of Muddle-earth.  Author'sprerogative, perhaps.  There are inconsistencies enough in this dream.Now get back to the main action, Pipkin!   Zap, zap went the mad wizard's blaster.  Argh, argh went theEasterlings and the Southrons, one by one by one.  Then the wizard wentsquawk as Orm Embar grabbed him with the claws of his powerfulforelegs.  Although Gandalf was nearly six feet tall and after histussle with Forlong was grown nearly as wide across the waist, thedragon had no trouble tossing the terminally surprised ball of lard highinto the air.  The blaster separated from his hand and took its owntrajectory through the lower atmosphere of Muddle-earth, until it wasdestroyed in a blinding flash by a jet of pale blue flame fromKalessin's mouth.  There were shock diamonds in that jet, and the dragonsailed half his (or was it her?) own length up and backwards, trailingyellow smoke.  Gandalf reached the top of his arc.  His mouth grew roundand his eyes wide open, but he had stopped squawking.   Then Yevaud's mighty tail swung round, thicker near the middle than aman is tall yet faster than a whiplash.  Yellow smoke streamed thickfrom his nostrils.  Dragons of Earthsea may yield one mastery to one whospeaks their true names, but they will choose the manner so as to bestserve (or amuse) themselves.   &gt;CRACK&lt;   Pipsqueak saw that he had accomplished more than he had purposed.  Asone the dragons abandoned their play.  With the ancient yet vigorousKalessin in the lead they pursued instead the rapidly receding wizardtowards the flaming Mt. Viagra in the far distance.  A baseball cap, toPipsqueak like a large tent, landed on a broken patch of tarmac somedistance from him before dissolving back into nothingness.   The flight of the dragons, both the arrival and the departure, causedsome panic in both armies.  Aragon did not panic, but Babar did.  Risingon his hind legs, he trumpeted with fear, and Aragon fell to the ground.At that impact, the ground shook.  Shopping malls slid and fell, roofscaving in.  A great smoke rose.  Pipsqueak rejoiced at this sight.  Thecollapse of the two Towers of the Teeth, however, caused him a greatunease, though he did not know why.   Aragon got back on his feet.  Each of his footsteps was a smallaftershock.  "That was a bad fall, Pipsqueak," he said.  "Imagine howbad it would have been but a week or two ago."   The sun shone suddenly warm and brightly, though it had not beenovercast before.  Pipsqueak found himself knee-deep in a basin of warmand pleasant water.  It had apparently once been a fountain near thegardening section of an ancient shopping-mall that was still standing,though the last paying customer must have left through the now brokenautomatic sliding doors when Methusalah wore nappies, or earlier.Pipsqueak's trousers might be drenched, but he felt as if wearing onlybathing trunks, and he was: quite an unusual attire for hobbits.  Thismade him feel rather bashful before the eyes of so many, but otherwisehe was happier than he could remember ever having been.  There was ahush.  No sword was raised, though many were unsheathed; no shaft wasspeeding, though many were on the bowstrings.  At this point Pipsqueaknoticed that his pistol was gone.  It did not worry him.   The two armies stood panting.  Then a Southron king strode forward,tall and broad-shouldered.  He was coal black, dreadlocks inlaid withgold thread reaching almost to his waist.  His right arm was missing;only a scorched stump stood out from the shoulder.  He was bleeding frommany small cuts on the left side of his body.  He raised his remaininghand in a gesture of peace, and stopped a few paces before Aragon.  Hecast a swift glance at Pipsqueak and smiled a little.   Aragon was grown slimmer.  He sheathed his sword.  It needed nowiping first: there was no blood on it.   Then the Southron spoke.  "Now that that meddlesome menace Inkánushis gone, can we be friends, man?  Can we have a little peace again?"   The sun continued to shine without malice.

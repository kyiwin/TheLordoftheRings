        Sam roused himself painfully, but the less said about that,the better. Unable to proceed without falling into the chasm at hisfeet, he had stood around for a while in a rêverie, into which, notunnaturally, thoughts of wogah (specifically, of Spiegel) hadintruded. His earlier indifference to Spiegel's loss had been theresult of the shock of having been kidnapped, and confusion as towhether he was a true proletarian hobbit, or the heir of Isildur -- orboth. But now that the shock and confusion were past, his earlieraffection for Spiegel renewed itself within his heart.        "Who kens what indoctrinations and postmodern tortures she is nowbein' subjected tae!" thought Sam.  "She must be freed from Sauron'sgrip. Aye, I shall rescue Spiegel, and then tak the Ring to Mt.Viagra, or me name ain't Vladimir Ilyich Lenindil!" (Vladimir Ilyichwas his name in Westron; and he liked the name Lenindil, despite hisdoubts whether he was indeed, as Sauron claimed, the heir of Isildur.)        After he was done getting roused, another thought occurred tohim: while rescuing Spiegel, he could also get hold of Frodo and makethat little rat suffer for the "armchair revolutionary" insult - bymaking the oppressor an instrument of the Revolution.        Meanwhile, Gullible had moved a little out of earshot and taken awalkie-talkie out of his bag. "Agent 007 to Fat Lord," he said."Situation excellent, preciouss.  S has the R and is determined to dothe needful with it. Please alert our contactses.  Deliverance fromNassty is at hand.  Nassty will pay for calling us a narrativeirrelevancy, ssaddam.  Over and out."  He returned to Sam, and smiledin a suitably servile manner.  "Has hobbit decided what to do yet?" hegrovelled.        "Yes," said Sam.  "I must rescue Spiegel before destroying the Ring.But I have nae idea how to do either.  It doesn't look as we'll get nofurther."        "Before we fleeds, Don Giovanni heard nasties say something aboutgoing to the Tower of Cirith Undies.  To get there, we need to get toLithlad Station and take the Subway."                Sam gazed at the abyss at his feet.  In the background, in the lovelyersatz chalet of Cirith Iodel, he heard an exquisite soprano warbling:    DOR! A land, an Orkish land!    RHî! A crown for royal dude!    MIR! A jewel I hold in hand!    FA! I'd tell you, but it's rude!    SÛL! It's Sindarin for wind!    LANG! A cutlass or a sword!    Dî! A bride with Sauron sinned!    And that brings us to Mor-DOR, DOR ...A gunshot echoed in the mountains, and the song abruptly ceased. Andhard and cruel and bitter was the parking lot that met Sam's gaze.        "This is where the suburbanites leave their cars so they can usepublic transit ssysstem," explained the Don.  "Border between Mordorand Gondor heavily congessted with traffic, yes it is.  Lots ofpeople moving to Mordor; very chic, precious, very chic.  One day allpeoples will be inside, if we don't desstroy nassty Ring."        "Doesn't look very chic, with all this asphalt," said Sam.  "I reckonMordor is lowbrow after all."        "It'ss a parking lot," said Gullible.  "Were you expectingCorinthian, preciouss?"        "Weell, cultured or not, we've got to get down there somehow,"observed Sam brilliantly.  "I suppose this is where we use me rope?"        "No, let'ss ssave that for nassty ssarcasstic hobbit," said Gullible."We'll take elevator instead."        "What elevator?" inquired Sam.          "Follow uss," replied Gullible.        Gullible led Sam back into the alpine countryside. The hobbits cameto a stop at a linden tree; Gullible pulled one of the branches off,and a hidden door opened, through which the hobbits boarded theelevator.        "We'll go down to level C, and there we'll head south to LithladStation," said Gullible, pushing a button.  "A long walk, preciouss. Many carss.  Some grim and evilses, some noble and sssad.  Many proudand fair, with crown in their ssilver hoodses.  But all stinking, allrotten, all emitting carbon monoxide.  A fell gleam isss in theirheadlightsss.  Saddam.  We musst be very careful," he added, "ordrug lordss will shoot us.  Lucky thing hobbit met Don Giovanni, acosDon knowss drug lordses and can protect sstu... sensible hobbit."        The elevator stopped, and the hobbits got out.  Now began the worstpart of Sam's journey, compared to which the scaling of Mount Viagrawas as a picnic in Woody End Park in the Shire.  Cars upon carslowered before his horror-stricken gaze.  At first he looked withinterest at the licence plates and bumper stickers: "I Brake forWinged Balrogs", "I &lt;heart&gt; Minas Epcot", "If Rings of Power wereOutlawed, Only Outlaws would have Rings of Power", "It's a TrollThing; You Wouldn't Understand", "The White Council Is Racist", alongwith more refined sentiments, such as "Maria Khallas Kicks Tebaldi'sRear End", "Empower the Periphery through the Deconstruction of PowerStructures", and "Who Would Conquer the World, Must First Get the Ringof Wogah" -- to say nothing of totally obscure items like "The Natureof Being Is Psotting to TEUNC", "Bha, I Walays Tyope My Repeats","Bother, said Pooh. Some Stupid Halfwitt Has the Ring!", and "I Moofor Dwagins".  But after a while, the cold deadening monotony ofpassing car after car after car, in an asphalt desert where horses hadno names, almost overwhelmed him.  Nor did the eerie shapes he saw outof the corner of his eye contracting various illicit-looking deals andoccasionally shooting each other do anything to increase hisconfidence.        "Gullible," he said eventually, "are we mostways there yet?"        "We makess good progress," said Gullible.  "We have finished StraightLot.  Now we come to Winding Lot."        Sam was thoughtful for a moment. "When we get tae the Subway, they'llknow at once that we're no from around here," he said. "Maybe weshould have stopped at the Mall of Gorgoroth and bought us someOrc-gear like that toff Gorbush had.  As we're in Mordor, we'd betterdress in Mordor-fashion; and anyway there isn't nae choice."        "Don Giovanni came prepared for that, ssaddam," said Gullible. "Look!"        He took a bundle out of his pack and opened it.  Sam looked indisgust at the contents, but there was nothing for it: he had to putthe things on, or go naked, and even Kinko wasn't into exhibitionism. (Wlokay, he could have gone on wearing his own clothes, but he'd lostmost of them when the party was attacked, and his current outfitneeded a rendez-vous with a washing-machine -- badly.)  There werelong slacks of some unclean polyester-fell, and a vest of expensiveleather.  Over a white cotton tunic went a tie of stout ring-mail, toolong for Sam and heavy. The Don had also brought several Orc-helmets,that in the Black Speech were called fedoras.        Having disguised themselves as best they could, they set out again. The journey through the Winding Lot was much like that through theStraight Lot, except that their route sloped gradually downwards, in asort of spiral.  Finally, when Sam thought he would scream if he sawanother Mordcedes-Lurtz, Khadillak of Harad, Shevrolugbúrz,Orcsmobile, or Ford of Isen -- to say nothing of the Nazdas,Elfbusters, Torogas, Valaraukor, Gondas, Sangahyundaes, Orcuras, NastyGreen Slimy Beasties, Ancalagons, Smaug-guzzlers, Nissis, and ThÛbarus-- they came to an end of the cars, and beheld a glass wall, and aglass door in the midmost thereof, and over the door was carven theword: Subway.  And they rejoiced at the sight and were glad.        Three eras had passed in the history of Mordor's public transitsystem.  In the Dark Years during the Second Age, Sauron and Mini hadcreated an efficient Eagle Express system. But after the loss of theRing, the Eagles got uppity and services declined, so Sauron createdan underground railway system that was the wonder of the world, withfast and clean vehicles and sumptuously elegant stations. In thelatter years of the Third Age, however, budget cuts in transportationhad changed all this -- although there is no denying that some of theolder stations retained a dishevelled dryad loveliness. But the systemwas showing its age and tending to a certain greyish monotony, despiteSauron's attempts at inexpensive beautification through paintings andsculptures by various avant-garde artists.  The trains no longer ranas frequently as they had aforetime -- especially on weekends -- forbudget cuts had impaired services.  It didn't help matters that thestations near the Western border were the abode of drug-traffickersand other nasties, for the mind of Sauron was too often elsewhere inthese latter days (elsewhere being primarily various portions ofShelob's anatomy).        The hobbits mastered their fears and entered the station, taking aglass elevator downstairs to the main lobby, where they stood in linefor twenty minutes or so at the booth behind several snooty Orcs,mischievous Trolls, and fascinatingly witty Balrogs.  While theywaited, Gullible explained their route.        "We need to take ungwë train to 42nd Ssstreet, which the Orcs callMishkoltz, preciouss," he said. "Long ride and out of our way, but noother way to make the connection, because the Northeast-boundngwalmë doesn't run on weekends; doing nassty and inconvenientconsstruction work, the Orcses are.  Ungwë train takess uss to CanalStreet, at ssouthern corner of Lithlad Station. There we get onssilmë nuquerna, which goess to 161st Street, the northern corner ofLithlad.  There we need to get on quessë and take it to CirithUndies. Very crowded at Cirith Undies; lots of outdoor operaperformances there, yess lotss.  They hurts our ears, my poor littleears."        "Ye mean there are trains runnin' inside the train station?"blurted Sam, startled.        "Yes, ssaddam," replied Gullible. "Big station.  Orcses and stuffmusst gets through somehow.  This is the only way."        "But why is the station so huge?" asked Sam.        "Acos Sauron got carried away with his building craze and didn'tknow where to sstop, the basse masster of treachery... saddam." Gullible said nothing about the corrupt building schemes in whichSauron's evil twin Saurtre had been engaged, before he finally ran offand joined the narco-terrorists for a lark; for no one learned of thatuntil Mordor's secret archives were made available to historians inafter days.        "Wow, Gullible, ye really are an expert!" cried Sam.        "Comess with the job, precciouss," said Gullible, patting himself onthe back.At this point they finally found themselves at the head of the line.         "Where ya goin'?"  asked the guy in the booth.        "Cirith Undies," said Gullible.        "6 flokarinos," said the guy.  Gullible put his head close to thewindow-pane and whispered something that Sam couldn't hear; but theguard became almost polite and handed Gullible two tokens with wingedspeed. The hobbits passed through a turnstile to the platform, whereseveral surly Orcs and other denizens of the Land of Shadow and HighCulture, mostly in uniform, stood around, waiting for the dilatoryungwë to wend its way thither.        While waiting, Sam tried to listen to the locals, but couldn't hearmuch, as no one spoke above a whisper.  He did hear bits and pieceslike "situation in Ethelien's getting worse", "even in Dor Remi", "theBig Bosses, even the Biggest, can make mistakes", "something almostslipped", "too lax", and "curse the Gondorians!"  Even theLurtzafarians seemed to be rather down.        Finally the train arrived.  There is little to tell abouttheir journey, for monotonous is the public transit in the Land ofChiaroscuro Lighting Effects. They were in a land of darkness wherethe days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered wereforgotten too.  Oft and anon the trains would stop between stations,or would suddenly start going in the exact opposite direction to thatin which they were supposed to go.        "Come on, you miserable sluggard!"  growled Sam, after thequesse train had stalled for 45 minutes. "Now for it!"  Out westwardin the world it was drawing near noon upon the seventeenth day of Marchin the Shire-reckoning, and even now Gandalf was smothering (or almost)Paragraph Took, shooting Ariellë, pretending to murder Dr Faramir,and trasking and burning Denethor and Co.; Otto was incineratingMorrie (or so everyone thought, although it turned out later that theincinerator was really a transporter); I suppose we should be gladthat Sam didn't get liquidated and replaced by some colourless slobnamed Blotto; Aragon was bringing Boromir back to life and turninghim into the splitting image of the ancient king Wupdidu and killinghim again by accident; the indestructible Steward's heir was being brought back to life by Ariellë -- who withal was alteringArwen's sexual identity (but brief was that amour) -- and then killedagain by Gandalf and then coming back to life, revealed as a truetoon; El Rond was, very likely, being poisoned by a disgruntled chef;and I would not be surprised if some nasty little computer gremlinshad somehow annihilated all the Valar (come on, can I at least killoff Tolkas? I never liked the guy), and if Eru had brought them backfrom the dead with all deliberate speed.  At one point, tachyonparticles wiped out all life, but fortunately Captain Picard saved theday by going back in time, etc., etc., etc.. Yet amid all their caresand fear and premature deaths and resurrections, the thoughts of theirfriends (and enemies) turned constantly to Frodo and Sam (andoccasionally to Gullible).  They were not forgotten. But they wereconveniently beyond aid, and no thought could bring any help toSamwise, Hamfast's son and Don Giovanni Tenorio the Gullible; theywere utterly alone.  For their purpose was to serve as fall guys, sothat Gandalf and the leaders of the West could maintain a plausibledeniability, if the mission went agley.  (Although Gandalf'sdeniability was getting less plausible with each enormity hecommitted.)        As they waited for the train to get moving again, Sam mulledover the events of the last few days.  "I'm sair confuzzled, andthat's a fact," he thought. "It's me eternally self-doubting sidea-comin' oot again." He recalled Google Junction: the billboards andone-hour motels uncounted, the gas wars, the commercialism, theremakes of Flipper and Mr. Ed, the boring conferences; heremembered the neon glitz of Shelob's nightclub. And yet, Sauron hadsubjected the hobbits to opera and other classical music stuff in anappallingly ornamental setting; and had, moreover, conveyed a certaindeconstructionishness. Was it possible that more than one culturallevel existed in the Black Land, that everything in it was not of oneboring, stereotypical, cartoon-evil piece?  To get an idea of whatMordorian culture was like, Sam looked at the ads that embellished thetrain's interior. Obviously, this question was much more importantthan the boringly practical one of how he was supposed to get to MountViagra and destroy the Ring without being killed.  But it was not easyto get an answer.  Much poetry he beheld, most of it by Gorbush, thevery same who had wogahed Spiegel from his arms. A fairly typical oneread:     gondor narconasties     wouldn't you know it?     losers!And another:     lady hobbit she's really sexy     wogah wogah did you say? yep     ~&amp;~But right next to this somewhat arcane stuff, Sam saw an advertisementfor Koorsthak Lite, and next to that, a painting of a can ofKampbelghurghak's Soup by Andy Orchol, provocatively captioned "Is ItArt?" Thereafter came a painting of giant watches by Salvad-dÛr Dalrog...Sam's eyes began to glaze over, barely taking in the ad forHustler that followed.  As he pondered the matter, Sam came to afearful realization: In the postmodern bizarrerie of the Mordoraesthetic, pop kitsch and highbrow avant-gardism went hand in hand. (Meanwhile, Gullible was engrossed in Spying for Dummies.)        Finally they escaped from the toils of Mordor's public transitsystem. They found themselves in the Cirith Undies district, an area sopostmodern that even Derrida was shocked. Strange shapes they saw,which resembled bits of molten lava that had cooled and lay liketwisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented earth. As he lookedmore closely, Sam saw that these weird shapes were actually some kindof rarefied metal sculpture.  "By Lugnardo da Vinyamar, the pomoNazdaq sculptor, ssaddam," hissed Gullible. From somewhere to theirleft came the sound of singing and orchestral music, wherein Samrecognized the vile evil of opera, which The Badguy Formerly Known AsGandalf had once called "an abomination so loathsome that the veryheavens seem to plug their ears in horror".  (That purple passage waspresumably ghost-written.)        To the right, Mount Viagra and Barad-dÛr lowered in the distance.As he gazed upon Barad-dÛr Sam groaned at the bad jokes that issued forththerefrom, and took no comfort whatsoever in the fact that they werecultured bad jokes, such as "how many sopranos does it take to screwin a light-bulb", and several very nasty jokes about tenors andviolists. He barely listened as Gullible explained the postmodern(absence-of-)significance of the enormous dinner-forks that adornedthe battlements of Barad-dÛr, and of the gum that it metonymicallychewed and popped ("that was scary, and that's a fact," as Sam laterrecalled), how they (re)"present"ed the hypertextuality of being,etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.   Multipurposed and polyvalent wasSauron's stronghold, the ironic and clever dinner forksmise-en-questioning the buttresses of knife-edged iron, walls ofimpenetrable stone, doors of heavy adamant all marked "ENTRANCE ONLY,"and interminable window offices, which in turn gave this monument tohighbrowdom the appearance of a movie set for some film noir -- animpression that could not quite dispel the drollery conveyed by theminiature busts of Orc-composers that stood over each entrance, northe erotic appeal of the posters of Shelob that adorned the doors.        Further off Sam and Gullible beheld the terrible mountain, thedread goal of their quest.  Ever and anon the furnaces far below itsuplifted head would grow hot, and with a great surging and throbbingpoured forth a river of some disgusting fluid or other from chasms inits sides, blazing towards Barad-dÛr down great channels of strangelyFreudian aspect, while purple flames soared heavenwards.        "We are not going that way yet, if hobbit insists on ssilly resscueplan," ssnorted Gullible. "We musst go left if we are to get to CirithUndies.  Unfortunately, it will not be easy.  We'll ssee, precious, ohyess, we'll ssee."        "Hobbit does insist on silly rescue plan," said Sam.  "Let's go!"        The hobbits bore to their left, where they found themselves firstin a kind of park, whose shrubbery was trimmed into shapes of shockingindecency (at least by Shire standards: "No sex please; we'rehobbits!" was the Shire's motto). Some giant roaches had organized atap-dancing party in a piazza. Here peace still reigned, if a watchfulone.  Sam and Guillible heard a soprano singing a duet with a barelyaudible alto over a chorus of bassi. Before long, they arrived at acrowded outdoor amphitheatre full of Orcs, Trolls, Rogs,jack-o'-lanterns, and other aliens, all dressed to the nines andgaping at a stage within a kind of band shell.  Sam looked, and wasfilled with horror at what he saw: Orcs lighting bonfires and toastingmarshmallows by having slaves hold them in the fire with their barehands, while a woman knelt on the floor and sang some aria ofheartbreaking beauty. A small figure in an elaborate costume wastrying to sing alto, but all that came out was an annoying squeal. The supratitles didn't help much, for the sentence In 3010, thepotatoes triumphed conveyed little meaning to Sam's mind.        Enraged at this treatment of the slaves, Sam cried out: "Iend this exploitation! Why do ye allow your oppressors tae inflict thisindignity upon ye?  Rise, for ye have nowt tae lose but your chains --and that's a fact!"        "Ssssh! Ssstupid hobbit!" hissed Gullible.        "Cannot you see that this is great art?" sniffed an Orc in theaudience nearby, whom Sam recognized as Gorbush.        "I find the interruption very apt," said a Nazdaq, sitting nextto Gorbush. "It is a metaphor for aesthetic aperture.  There is noclosure or finality to the artistic work, but it is imminent withinbeing."  Naturally, the Nazdaq sent shivers of dread and despair downSam's spine, and all that.        "I see your point, Lugnardo ..." began Gorbush, but before hecould reply, another Orc yelled at the would-be alto (who was,unfortunately, now partially audible), "Ho la!  You there, youdunghill rat! Do you call that a high B-flat?  Stop your squeaking, orI'll come and deal with you.  D'you hear?" Annoyed, Lugnardo cast aparalysis spell on the complaining Orc; thereafter, the audience wasmore or less quiet until the intermission.        During the intermission, Sam, accompanied by Gullible, corneredGorbush and asked what the Utumno was gaein' on. (Gorbush easily sawthrough their pitiful Orc-disguises in any case.)        "This is a performance of Verdishnakh's Uglucco," explainedGorbush.  "A brilliant, radical production by Lugnardo the Nazdaqsculptor.  (Not as radical as Petér Sellárz's production of DonCeleborno; Sauron nixed that and the director as well.)"  He loweredhis voice, and whispered, "Lugnardo is also charged with protectingFrodo. We have to be extra careful, since he's making his operaticdebut today, under the pseudonym Andrea Bocelli." Gullible stretchedand yawned in facetitious boredom.        "Sae that's who the wee runt was, who couldnae sing," said Sam.Gorbush nodded. "And where are he and Spiegel being kept?" continuedSam. "And are they bein' weel treated?"        "Yes, they're being well treated," replied Gorbush in a whisper,"but we cannot discuss that further now. Even here, the Fat Lord hasspies. After the performance I will take you backstage to meet yourcompanions, and we shall see. For now, I will explain the opera toyou." Gorbush proceeded to do so, at length, for the rest of theintermission.  Sam remembered very little, except that the very lovelysoprano's name was Nazwaz, Easterling for "Flashing Lotus."  Gulliblehissed and muttered under his breath: "Who careses? Wasste time,ssaddam.  Need to desstroy curssed thingy. Gandalf will not bepleassed, precciouss, no he won't.  Beer iss too expenssive, ssaddam,ssaddam..."        When the intermission ended, Sam (having nothing better to do)sat through the rest of the opera, and actually found himself liking it(except for Frodo's performance, which stank), in spite of constantlyrepeating to himself in an undertone, "Opera is evil, and that's afact; opera is evil, and that's a fact; opera is evil, and that's afact..."  Gullible plugged his ears.        As they left the performance, Sam and Gullible found Gorbushin the middle of a heated argument with another Orc.        "Then you must go deliver my critique to Lugburz," he was saying."I must go backstage anyway.  But I'm hurt.  The Black Pits take thatfilthy hidebound traditionalist Ralfpat!" Gorbush's voice trailed offinto a string of politically charged epithets.  "I gave him betterthan I got, but he flamed me, the reactionary, before I killfiled him.You must go, or I'll get you demoted. News must get through toLugburz, or we'll both be for the Black Pits.  Yes, you will too.  Youwon't escape by skulking up here."        "I'm not going down those stairs again," growled Lurtz, "be you poetlaureate or no.  Nar! Keep your hands off your mouse, or I'll put avirus in your laptop's guts.  You won't be poet laureate long whenthey hear all about these goings-on.  I've fought  for the Toweragainst those stinking UNM-rats, but a nice mess you precious criticshave made of things, fighting over the new cabinet position."        "I have nae idea what the bloody UdÛn ye lads are talkin' aboot,"interrupted Sam.  "Nor do I care.  I just want to be taken to whereFrodo and Spiegel are, an' I'm no wantin' tae bide my time aboot it."        "Sssss! Wasste time! Very sstupid, yess, very dumb, yess verymoronic!" grumbled Don Giovanni.        "My apologies," said Gorbush to Lurtz.  "Hobbits don't understandthe finer points of Orc-etiquette, like Never interrupt a debate onaesthetics."  Turning to Sam and Gullible, he said, "This is Lurtz,Frodo's trainer in the martial arts, and my assistant." Turning backto Lurtz, he said, "I have to go now.  We will speak of this morelater.  Deliver the critique, and come back to the Tower after that,or I'll make you listen to Gondorian rap."  Lurtz shuddered andleft, muttering under his breath.        "Very well; since you are so eager to see your employer, let us beoff," said Gorbush to Sam and Gullible. "Excuse me, but I will have toblindfold you."        "Gettin' used tae it, by noo," muttered Sam, as the Orc placedspecial mauve-tinted glasses over his eyes.        "If you remove the glasses, an explosive will detonate," saidGorbush, as he prepared to put another pair of glasses over Gullible'seyes.        "Ssssss! We're friendsses! You can't seriously mean to blindfold DonGiovanni!" hissed Gullible.        "You're not on the list of persons with security clearance; so yes,I do seriously mean to blindfold Don Giovanni," replied Gorbush, doingit.        "Cruel! Tricksy! False!" whinged Gullible; but under his breath hesneered, "Trusst not in ssikrit wayses; we have long spied out thisrealm, yess preciousss, hee hee!"        They went on a longish trip, taking several elevators, an escalatoror two, and the odd secret passage.  When Gorbush finally removedtheir blindfolds, they found themselves in a modern art gallery filledwith Dalrogs, Van Gorgoroghs, Myrchs, Mordnets, Pollorks, and otherhorrors. "Frodo and Spiegel are in the Pikassoblug," whisperedGorbush.  He revealed that a somewhat distorted female portrait was infact a panel in the wall leading to Frodo's and Spiegel's secretlodgings.  As they entered the hidden apartment, the realization thatFrodo was near filled Sam with revolutionary rage, and he sang in aloud voice:     In Western lands beneath the boss,     the banners rise in Spring,     the workers march, the peasants cuss,     the merry Wobblies sing.     Or maybe Rosie calls a strike     and swaying beeches bear     placards and posters, red on white     amid her branching hair.     Though here at journey's end I lie,     in pomo buried deep,     beyond all corporate towers high,     beyond all prices steep,     the workers' flag is scarlet bright     for blood our martyrs shed:     I will not sell my life for lite,     until the boss is dead.        "Oh dear, I left Spiegel's... erh... thing behind," saidGorbush in a worried voice.  "I'll be right back.  Don't move until Ireturn."  He darted out the hidden entrance. Sam and Gullible lookedaround the luxuriously appointed room in wonder, admiring itselaborate bookcases, filled with tomes with titles like MovablePeripheries: The Exiled Margin Rewrites Itself: A Study in EasterlingMÛmakisms.  As he stared uncomprehendingly at these books, Sam heardSpiegel moaning in a room nearby, and rushed in.  Sam trembled withdesire, and could not speak. Spiegel seemed slightly taken aback.        "Am I still dreaming?" she murmured.  "There was an Orc withmy... erh... thing in his hand, and it turns into Sam!  Then I wasn'tdreaming when I heard you singing just now, and tried to cover myears?  Was that you?"        "It was indeed, Spiegel," sighed Sam. "I'd given up hope, almost.I couldn't find you. But I have now, Spiegel, dear Spiegel."  He layback in Spiegel's gentle arms, like a child at rest when night fearsare chased away by some loved voice or hand.  Spiegel held him a bitawkwardly, as far away from her body as possible.        "Something hit me, didn't it?" mused Spiegel.  "And I fell intodarkness and erotic dreams, and woke and found that waking was evenmore erotic.  Orcs were all around me. Or rather, one was, but he washot enough for a thousand."  The enticing vision had seemed so real toher, half bemused as she still was with her desire for Gorbush.  Samhad changed before her very eyes into an Orc again, leering and pawingat her, a passionate creature with groping hands and a slobberingmouth.  But now the vision had passed. The creature was still leeringand pawing and groping and slobbering, but it was only a grubby littlehobbit.        And as Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on him buthanging on a chain from his neck, he felt enlarged, as if he wererobed in a huge distorted shadow of himself.  He felt that he had fromnow on only two choices: to forbear the Ring, though it might tormenthim, and challenge the Power that sat in its dark hold beyond thevalley of shadows; or to claim it, and seduce Spiegel.  Already theRing tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason.  Wild fantasiesarose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, striding with aflaming sword across Spiegel's fruited plain.  Then Pinko gained theascendancy over Kinko, and he saw himself once again as VladimirIlyich Lenindil, Hero of the Proletariat, and armies of workers andpeasants flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of theSauronite dictatorship. And then all the clouds rolled away, and athis command the Barad-dÛr Opera House etc. became a Kremlin andbrought forth Politburos.  He had only to destroy the Ring -- or so hethought -- and all this could be.   And after he became commissar,he'd have plenty of women to wogah -- a harem swollen to a realm; hisown hands to use, not the hands of others to command.        At this point, to Spiegel's relief, the door opened and Frodoentered. To say that he and Sam had a merry meeting would be stretchingit, but at least they didn't try to beat each other up.        "Your operatic debut was interestin'," deadpanned Sam. Frodo seemedpreoccupied, and merely grunted in reply.        "Ssstupid hobbitses waste time, messs up quesst," muttered Gulliblefor the twentieth time; but no one paid even the slightest attentionto him.        Frodo was accompanied by Jîvz, his Balrog valet, and Deeanna Troll,his counsellor. This last smiled at Sam and Gullible and said, "You'rehiding something!" before sashaying out of the the room in aprovocative gait.        "Bah, she was no very relevant to the plot, nohow," said Sam, aftershe had left.        "Please don't be so meta," said Spiegel.  "I can't stand it. Let'sstay in character, shall we?"        Frodo, meanwhile, was muttering to himself,  "The economy of beingis simply the unbecoming of unbeing ... rather like Elbereth'sperfume, that wafts into allergenicity. .. Why is this stuff sohard and BORING?  Why won't Sauron just give me the estate?"        "Ha!" said Sam.  "So the estate was a fake all along! Now we kenSauron's evil."        "I don't know if he's good or evil," replied Frodo.  "But he sureis strict.  I might even say: a fierce will, unknowing of mercy. He makesme get up every day at 5:30 a.m., read theory, swim, then afterbreakfast I have to take a quiz, talk with Sauron ... Then he lets mehave one hour of recreation, but after that I have to study the BlackSpeech for two hours; after lunch -- which consists mostly of tofu --I practice fencing with Lurtz, then religious instruction withCounsellor Deeanna Troll, then complete rest in the dark, then voicelessons with Gorbush, then I have to read more theory (GermaíneGrír, bgheeeahkhgh!!). After dinner, I take another quiz, religiousservice, talk to Sauron, bed ... Whenever I ask about my estate, hesays I'm not worthy yet.  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!  Ifeared that it was so."        "By the way," asked Sam, hastily changing the subject, "how did yeknow the way to Mordor earlier? Ye'd never been there before."        "Oh, Sauron gave Frodo and me homing devices while you were in thebathroom," replied Spiegel. "On coming to the asphalt parking lot, wealmost wondered if Sauron were indeed evil ...  Sauron laughed when Itold him that. He's sexeeeeeee! And ever since he took away that nastyphial, Frodo has been almost bearable, though he still has relapseswhen one wants to strangle him."        [Here the MS. contains an interpolation in a suspiciously roggy hand:"Sauron is as pure as the driven snow.  Since I'm the narrator, thismust be true.  And Sauron's Diary is canonical.  And I am taking overthe e-text, mwahahahhahahahhahahaha!!!"]        "I believe it is time for you to read Textual Sex and Sexual Tests,sih," interposed Jîvz unctuously.        "Shut up, Jîvz," said Frodo.  "This is a greater matter than youknow."        "Please it your Highness to remember ..." murmured Jîvz        "It pleases my Highness principally to be obeyed, old mutterer. Nowgo!"  Jîvz bowed and left the room.        Sam scowled on observing Frodo's only too familiar treatment of hisservants.  Nevertheless, mindful that he still needed Frodo's help(whether freely given or forced), Sam restrained himself from killingthe git, and instead asked, "Would ye like tae aid us on a leetlequest?  A mere trifle, we just need tae destroy the Ring and free theWestern Lands from evil.  You'll still get your estate, I'm sure. Indeed, I'll warrant ye'll hae a better time governing it as your ownmaister than as a subject of Sauron.  But first, we need tae get ridof the Ring, and that's a fact."        "You've got it?" gasped Frodo.  "You've got it here?  Give it to me!"he cried out, standing up, holding out a trembling four-fingered andgloved hand.  "Give it me at once!  You can't have it!"  He panted,staring at Sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity.        "Nay, ye avaricious bastard -- I mean, auspicious mastard. We mustdestroy yon evil engine of sorcery."        "You won't give it back, you say? Curse you, Sam, you little maggot!If you think I'm so damaged from my operatic debut and postmodernreading load that it's safe to flout me, you're mistaken.  Come here,and I'll sing falsetto in your ear.  And when some new lads come, I'lldeal with you: I'll send you to Bergzum-ishi's Wozzeck."        "I'll no give it back, not before you're dead anyway," answered Samsurlily.  "I've told you twice that we need to destroy it."        "So that's it, is it?" yelled Frodo.  "You'll do this, and you'llnot do that?  And after stealing the Ring, you'll bolt and leave me. No, you won't!  I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly first."        "Frodo, you're not helping," interrupted Spiegel.  "Why don't youleave this to me?"  She gave Frodo one of her persuasive looks, and henodded.        "I'll give you fifteen minutes to change the little Bolshevik'smind," he said.  "Meanwhile, I'll try to read some of this textual sexstuff, though reading it has practically cured me of any sexual desireI might have once had: I can't even fantasize about fishes anymore,without being reminded of incredibly boring highbrow lit crit." Withthat he stomped off.        Sam and Spiegel looked at each other in silence for a few minutes,remembering the happy and golden days of Book IV, when they had rompedin Disgiliath in innocent joy, laughing through their tears (mostly atFrodo).  Then, as Sam's thought returned to the mission at hand, Sam'sface darkened.        "So," he said, "are ye with me or against me?"        "My destiny is here," said Spiegel. "I must stay in Mordor andraise the consciousness of its people.  They need it so much, for an evilcorruption is seeping its way into the realm from the northwest."  Shesighed. "Please don't destroy the Ring, Sam," she implored. "Can't yousee that we were wrong about Mordor?  That Orcs are not all evil?"        "Nay, we must annihilate it," said Sam.  "If we don't, the Sauroniteswill take over, and their tyranny will be far worse than that of thecurrent Imperialist and Global Capitalist hegemonists."        "Sauron has brought peace to many realms," said Spiegel. "Toreadorand Cuspidor rejoice together; the topless beaches of the Southronkingdom of Rîô are in harmony with the gaming establishments of MinasVegas ..."        "His aggression shall not stand!" cried Sam.        "Why are you so sure that destroying the Ring is the right thing todo?" rejoined Spiegel.  "Because Gandalf says so?  Doesn't sound likethe Sam I know, believing something just on the authority of some fatmountebank in a pointed hat. And Gandalf is evil.  I haveexperienced the subtle -- or not so subtle -- psychological torture hedispenses in the name of advice.  And if Gandalf is so good, how doexplain the Barbie and Ken incident?   I suppose since Barbie was anEasterling and Ken an Orc, Gandalf was perfectly in the right when heturned them into plastic dolls and merchandised them."        "Tae crooked eyes truth may wear a wry face," intoned Sam.        "Indeed your eyes are almost blind," said Spiegel.  "Blinded withhatred for your Master.  You cannot see beyond your personal and classhatred.  If you did, you would realize that destroying entire races ofpeople through the annihilation of the Ring is wrong."        "Entire races?" echoed Sam.  "Aye, I forgot ye're an Orc-lover."        "Ah, so that's what's changed you," said Spiegel.  "Jealousy illbecomes you.  There is more at stake here than our personal feelings.What will happen if the West conquers?  The Orcs will be wiped out. Ordoes your belief in equality not extend to Orcs?  Because mine does!Ah, Sam, in the name of our friendship, please try to understand ..." Sam began to say something, then stopped, gazing upon Spiegel's faceintently.  His expression lost some of its harshness, and a furtivetear trickled down his cheek.        "Don't lissten to her!" screamed Gullible.  "Hobbit-witch lies,yess she doess.  She cheats us with Orcses, betrays us to them, preciouss. We musst desstroy the Ring! We musst!  Gandalf says so, and he's thegoodguy!  Sauron's the villain! SSSADDAM!!!!"        Sam continued to waver.  But at just that moment Frodo returned,still holding his Textual Sex book.  "I happened to hear the lastpart of your conversation," he remarked.  "It seems to me that evenSam ought to be able to understand that the metaphysics underlyingSauron's social democratic centralized decentralizm is nothing lessthan the modalization of being through the trajectory of its owneros."        "Bourgeois radical chic flummery!" retorted Sam, in whom hatredfor Frodo now stifled all other feelings, even his affection for Spiegeland his revolutionary ideals.  "I have made up me mind.  The Ring mustbe annihilated, to avenge your tyranny, ye effete decadent armchairfascist!".        "I end all this!" cried Frodo, suddenly seizing the Ring.        "No, no!" yelled Gullible, snatching the Ring back from Frodo'swhite-gloved, oddly cartoonish hands.  "No you won't, you thief!"        But at that moment, Deeanna Troll rushed into the room with cinematicabruptness and seized Frodo, covering the hobbit's mouth; but Spiegelwas still free and cried out, "Treachery!"        In ran Jîvz from the sauna room. "I cannot allow this to continue,"he said, brandishing his elegant Second-Age whip.        But Gullible was ready.  "Thiss iss sset to kill, ssaddam," hehissed.        "Bah, you can't kill ..." began Jîvz, before his sentence was cutshort by Gullible's devastating aim.        "Maybe not, but at leasst we can ssstuns you," sneered Gullible, asthe Balrog valet collapsed.        "GUARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" screamed Frodo as he struggled to freehimself from Deeanna's grip, but in vain.        "They've gone fishing, sih," Jîvz reminded him, as the Balrogregained consciousness..        "At my orders," said Deanna Troll.  "This country wants setting torights, and Gandalf is the one to do it.  Enough of this week-kneedhigh culture crap.  With that ring destroyed, we can make this an evilempire to be proud of... You see," she said with a sneer, "I'vebeen hiding something."        Meanwhile Sam and Gullible hastened to the door, exited throughthe Pikassoblug painting, and fled through the art gallery.  Even as heran, Sam wept.  Curiously, all the museum guards seemed to believetheir explanation that they were performance artists, even though theperformance had the unusual title, "Fat Lord's Orders."  Away into thenight they sped.  From the bowels of the outdoor opera theatre issueda high and dreadful wail.  Far up above in the darkness it wasanswered.  Out of the sky there came dropping like a bolt a wingedshape, rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek.  A jet-propelledBalrog it was, bearing a Nazdaq on what Sam supposed to be some vilemission of evil, possibly involving ballet.        "They've taken everything, Spiegel," said Frodo.  "EverythingI had.  Do you understand?  Everything!"  He cowered on the flooragain with bowed head, as his own words brought home to him thefullness of the disaster, and despair overwhelmed him.  "The questhas failed, Spiegel.  Even though he's an idiot and his magic tricksare transparent, we can't escape Gandalf's dominion.  Only 'Rogs canescape.  Away, away, out of Middle-earth, with winged speed, far awayover the Sea.  If even that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out."        "I still have hope," said Spiegel.  "I will not give up yet."        "Now I'll never get my estate!" whined Frodo. "I feared thatit was so."        "Is that all you can think about?" said Spiegel indignantly. "There's much more at stake than that! Entire races of people couldbecome extinct!  Come! We must inform Sauron at once."        "Yes," admitted Frodo. "We must tell Sauron what that slimylittle footpad and his 'Revolutionary' lackey have done."        So it was that when Gorbush finally returned, he found Samand Gullibe gone, and Frodo and Spiegel in the videoconference room.Lugnardo and Jîvz were also there, hanging their heads with shame;but Deeanna Troll was gone. Sauron was on the screen, and he did notlook happy. He sighed and murmured, "I was a fool! A fool! Ah!"
   Sam had just wits enough left to seize the phaser from Gullible andthrust it back into his breast.  "Run, Gullible!" he cried.  "No, notthat way!  There's a sheer drop over the wall. Follow me!"  Down theroad from the gate they fled.  In fifty paces, with a swift bend rounda jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of the line of firefrom the Tower.  They had escaped the hue and cry of the Balrogservants for the moment.  Cowering back against the rock they drewbreath, and then they clutched at their hearts.  "Chin oop, SamwiseGamgee!  Ye hae come tae fer tae be broot doon bae a wee bit o' hairtatteck noo..." muttered Sam.  Perching now on the wall beside theruined gate a Nazdaq sent out an alluring yet morbid aria.  All thecliffs echoed.  In terror they stumbled on.  Soon the road bentsharply eastward again and exposed them for a dreadful moment to asearch beam from the Tower.   A scintillating red point appeared on the back of Sam's head scantmilliseconds before Gullible staggered into him and they both tumbledto the ground.  A puff of dust several meters beyond heralded theimpact of thousands of steel flechettes hurled from a rifle mountedat the top of one of the battlements.  As they flitted across thekilling field they glanced back and saw a great chrome-steel shapeupon it, manlike in shape yet taller; then they plunged down betweenhigh rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join theMorgul-road.  They came to the way-meeting.  There was still no signof orcs, nor of an answer to the song of the Nazdaq; but they knewthat the silence would not last long, in Mordor's places of highculture.  At any moment now the coherent photonic beam bombardmentwould begin.   "This will nae do, Gullible," said Sam.  "If we were real orcs, weshould be walking aroond in sweats, with backpacks on oor shouldersand books under oor arms, not roonin' away as if being sniped at wi'laser-sighted ordinance.  The first enemy we meet'll ken we are naeorcs.  We must get oof this road somehoo."   "But we can't," said Gullible, "not without wingses, precious!"Sam shuddered at the thought of Sauron's jet-propelled Balrogsstreaming forth from the tower and its six outbuildings.Even as he mused in dread, a tall Man appeared not twenty pacesdistant.  Sam and Gullible started and faced him in wonder, as theyhardly ever missed the onset of one of the Big Folk, howeverstealthy.  The man was dressed in very worn traveling leathers andwore a distinctive-looking sword and a silvery guitar.  For a momentSam feared that Maglor was back to cause more trouble, but then hesaw that the man had no ears.  He must have grimaced in pity, forthe man chuckled and said, "Don't worry, they'll grow back.  I'velost my eyes before, so I know.  Now let's get out of sight.  Followme."   As Sam and Gullible trailed the man warily, the sky above beganto turn overcast rapidly.  Shortly the sun peeked out from behind acloud... then another sun, then another.  Sam whirled in amaze andsaw that the Tower had vanished and all of Sauron's buildings alongwith it.  "Who be ye, and where be ye takin' us?" he demanded.   "Good questions, though the full answer would take longer than weare alloted, Master Samwise, or should I say Lenindil?  That isn'treally your name, you know."   "How come ye tae noo my name, or, er, what isn't my name...?"sputtered Sam.   "I know many things about you, for you have followed me into battle,and fought for me, and against me, and died for me, and by my hand.I will answer your first question and perhaps the rest will becomeclearer.  I go by many names, few of them yet known in Muddle-earth,but someday at least a few of you shall have heard of Corbin ofEmber."   "Corbin of Ember?  Well, who th--" began Sam, but Corbin hadalready begun to walk into the east.  Sam and Gullible had to hurryto catch up.   As they walked, Corbin listened carefully to Sam's tale of the quest as it had transpired from his point of view, pausing it brieflyto ask questions and comment.  When they all stopped to rest and takewhat few morsels of food Corbin could spare them, Sam managed to foolGullible into dropping the Ring by shouting that it was on fire - which,as he expected, worked flawlessly.  Soon they moved on, with Corbindeftly leading the pair across a landscape that changed rapidly.   Meanwhile, at Sauron's tower, chaos had erupted, not for the firsttime this morning.  Frodo was taking a coffee break - a much-neededone, he muttered fitfully to himself - when a sudden commotion causedhim to dash to the stair to see what was going on.  Suddenly he sightedthree reavers, dressed in furs and outrageous-looking armor, bashingJîvz and the many other orcish servants with the flats of their swords.Frodo realized suddently that they had come for him!  As ran for hislife, the leader seized Gorbush's head in one great hand and bashedit against Lugnardo's.  A hollow crack! rang out as Spiegel, wailingin alarm and rage, leaped forward and was caught deftly by the secondreaver.  The third made a quick grab and Frodo, too, was trapped.Both Spiegel and Frodo now wrigged in undignified and highly agitatedpostures atop the shoulders of two tall warriors, while the middle oneinspected the unconscious butlers and poets.   "We had best make haste," he averred, looking at the inordinatelylarge and ominously empty pots of espresso strewn everywhere.  "Thereis evil here that does not sleep!"   The sky, having cycled through shades of graphite and snow as well asruby, strawberry, tangerine, lime, sage, blueberry, indigo, and grapehues, was now dim and unremarkably empty, a single westering yellowsun hidden from view.   "And here we shall part ways.  Here comes my associate with your'master' and that strange hobbit woman, Spiegel."   A hulk of a Man was herding a bedraggled and miserable-looking Frodoand an even more miserable-looking Spiegel along.  His clothingwas scant and he wore fur-lined boots and bore a gigantic two-handedsword.   "What ho, Cimmerian?" cried Corbin.  "What is best in life?"   "Crush da enemy, see dem driven before me, and listen to dalamentations of dere women!" grinned the barbarian.   "How--?  HOW did he get that - TRAITOR - out of Sauron's grip?"shouted a flabbergasted Sam.   "Let us ask him," suggested Corbin amiably.  "How did you rescuethem, my friend?"   "I had some... help," the huge man replied, his grin widening.   Suddenly, and with only a whisper of sound, a huge bronze dragonmaterialized between the parties.  Astride it sat a proud warrior,only vaguely human-looking, with a silver hand.  Behind him wasseated an albino personage of regal bearing and unreadablecountenance.  His eyes held a chilling intelligence as he regardedSam and Gullible wryly.  Strapped to the man's waist was a verylarge black runesword that reminded Sam of Dagnabit, the incrediblytalkative blade of Turin that had driven him, ironically, to fallupon it in order to smother its incessant babbling.  The bronzedragon belched flames unhurriedly and spat out a brownish,sweet-smelling substance on the ground.   "Very good!" exclaimed Corbin enthusiastically.  "That's betterthan I thought.  Did you complete the extraction without any hassles?"   "A little collateral damage," admitted the barbarian, nodding atthe first prince, who shifted his position to reveal a bound andgagged Gorbush, and Spiegel, whose thin ankles were bound withorcish rope.  The latter sniveled and burst into fresh tears."Thug, C'rum, we hates it forever, enron, enron!" she hissed,distraught.   Corbin spoke decisively.  "That's enough, Konan.  Why don't youuntie them now?"  The barbarian complied silently as Corbin mused,"How would the two of you like to come with me to a place wherethere are many orcs, well-treated and free from the domination ofsuch a one as yon Sauron?"  Gorbush continued to snore obliviously.   At this Spiegel perked up.  She mustered her dignity and looked atCorbin levelly, no mean feat considering their difference in height.   "Come.  We are needed.  There is much that you can do."   Corbin bent low to Sam, Gullible, and Frodo, whom the Cimmerianwar chief had shoved into the reunited group.  "Remember - trust noone.  The truth is... out there.  And the next time you meet a strange girl who escaped from some lab, don't be so surprised if shecan beat the crap out of you."  Corbin winked conspiratorially andstood.  "It's time to go," he called to the royal dragon-riders and thebarbarian, who followed a newly resolute-looking Spiegel as she strodealongside the bronze.  "To Britannica first, and thence... to Draino!"cried Corbin.  Together the party of six strode into the distance andvanished.   Scant seconds had passed when another man with no ears, dressed insilver and black, carrying a silver harp and an eerily similar blade,staggered into view.  His hair was dark but seemed unnaturally reddishat the roots.  Sam, Gullible, and Frodo pointed in unison.  "Nextshade over!"   Sam quickly took charge of the reunited group, over the expectedgrumblings of Frodo and the unexpected consternation of Gullible,who now seemed sullen and withdrawn.  Sam rallied both to march on.At length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against aboulder.  All were sweating.  Frodo tried to eat a few handfuls ofthe artificial snow and realized that it had no effect on histhirst.  "If Sauron himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'dshake his hand," he gasped.   "Don't say such things, ye traitor, or I'll cut ye throot!" snarledSam.  Then he stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spokeno more for a while.  At last with a struggle he got up again.  Ashe expected, Frodo was fast asleep.  "Wake up, pig!" he said.  "Comeon, ye soft slob!  You've hardly walked in days."   Sam kicked Frodo in the ribs and elbowed Gullible for good measure,though the latter was wide awake.  "MOVE out, lazy asses, or I'llkick ye all the way to the Mountain, and that's a fact!  DOUBLETIME!"  He now led the way, northward as near as he could guess,among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of thegreat ravine.   Frodo continued to whine until Sam relented and handed over hiscloak, which Frodo swapped with his heavier orc jacket.  "That'sbetter!" sighed Frodo.  "I feel much cooler.  I can go on now.But this campus is really depressing.  As I read theory in Sauron'slibrary, Sam, I tried to remember the Brandywine Bar, Woody's End,and The Water - any of the fine pubs in Hobbiton.  But I can't seethem now."   "Will you stop talking of water!" cried Sam.   "If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to her: 'Youimperialist oppressor, all we want is light and water: just cleanwater and plain flashlights, not this bottled phosphorescent oozethat's probably irradiating us all.'"  He hauled the Phial, nowglowing with its own faint green light, out of its lead-lined bagand shook it at a cringing Gullible and Frodo.  "But it's a longway to Lorien and that crazy--" Sam sighed and gesticulatedwildly towards the heights of the Ethel Duwap, now only to beguessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.   As Frodo, Sam, and Gullible stood and gazed, the rim of lightspread all along the line of the Ethel Duwap, and then they saw twoshapes, moving at a great speed out of the West, at first only apair of specks against the glimmering strip above the mountain-tops,but growing, until they plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy andpassed high above them.  As they zipped along, bobbing in thebreeze, the disembodied voice of a Nazdaq sent out a song in along, reverberating baritone; but this tune no longer held anyterror for them: it was the song of the washed-up, ill tidingsfor the Dark Tower.  The Leech-king had met Ms. Eowynifred ofEdoras City, Edoras, and her significant ohtar.   Sam's quick spirits sank again almost at once.  Even nestled inhis pocket, the burden of the Ring felt like an awful weight strappedto his waist - like the millstone of Sandyman's oppression!  Helooked at Frodo suspiciously, wondering if he realized the effecthis words were having.  Making a quick decision, he hauled Frodoaside, out of Gullible's view, surreptitiously slipping the ringfrom its chain and holding it at the base of his thumb.  "You lookpale, Frodo," he observed with mock concern.  "I've got onething I wanted: a phaser.  Enough to help us, though I guess it'sdangerous too.  Try a bit further, and then have a rest.  But takea morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves' food; it may hearten you."Pulling a twinkie from his pack and unfolding the forlorn leaffrom it, he jammed his thumb into it quickly, then divided it intothree pieces and handed one each to Gullible and Frodo.  Swallowingthe sweet, spongy cake as best they could with their parchedmouths, they plodded on as Sam strode with a smug grin that neitherof the others noticed.   The light grew no stronger, for Mount Viagra was still belchingforth a tremendous blue fume that, beaten upwards by the opposingairs, mounted higher and higher, until it reached a region abovethe wind and spread in an immeasurable roof, whose central pillarrose out of the shadows beyond their view.  They had trudged formore than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to ahalt.  Unbelievable, but unmistakable.  Water trickling.  Out ofa little gully, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the groundhad been generated by some low-grade terraforming software, watercame dripping down: the last remains, maybe, of some sweet raingathered from far distant seas, but ill-fated to fall at last uponthe walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless through the UNMcampus.  Here it came out of the rock in a little silver creek,and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly tobe lost among the dead stones.   Sam sprang towards the banks eagerly.  "If ever I see the Ladyagain, I will tell her!" he cried.  "THIS is potable water, notthat two-in-one watch dial paint she gave us!"  Then he stopped."You drink first, Frodo," he said.   "All right, but there's room enough for two."   "I didn't mean that," said Sam.  "I mean: if it's poisonous, orsomething that will show its badness quick, well, Master Bilbowas always going on about noblesse oblige, if you understand me."   "I do, you worthless scum.  But I think we'll trust our lucktogether, Sam; or our blessing.  Still, be careful now, if it'svery cold!"  Frodo's tongue was still numb from the touch of themagical sparkling snow.   The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste,like that of carbonated water laced with caffeine and brominatedvegetable oil, or so they would have said at home.  Here it seemedbeyond all praise, or indeed any aversion to caffeine overdose. They drank their fill, and Sam replenished his water-bottle.  Afterthat Frodo felt easier, and they went on for several blocks, untilthe broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall alongits edge warned them that they were drawing near to another campusbuilding.   "This is where we turn aside, Gullible," muttered Sam distractedly."Now, according to the folding map that came with the Deed, we mustturn east."  He sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across thevalley.  "I have just about enough strength left to get up to theCollege of Law there.  And then I've got to get some sleep."   The river-bed was now some way below the path. "You go to sleepfirst, Frodo," he said.  "It's getting dark again.  I reckon thisday is nearly over."  Frodo was, of course, asleep before the wordswere fully spoken.  Sam struggled with his own weariness, expectingFrodo to attack him for the Ring, but not daring to reveal hissubterfuge; and there he sat silent till deep night fell.  Then atlast, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place andlooked out.  The land seemed full of legal briefs being shuffledand books being unshelved and sly noises, but there was no othersound.   They woke together, hand in hand in hand.  All withdrew their handsin shock and looked at each other warily.  Sam was almost fresh, readyfor another day; but Frodo sighed.  His sleep had been uneasy, filledwith dreams of being impaled upon a Tree of Pain by an aristocratic-looking fellow whom everyone called "Count", and waking brought him nocomfort. Still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: hewas stronger, more able to stagger along through the huge campus.Strangely enough there was no mass transit here, though LithladStation had been a hotbed of activity.  They did not know the time,nor how long they had slept; but after a little wandering and searchthey found a covered walkway that took them partway across the UpperQuad.   Against his earlier expectation, Sam now hoped that Frodo mightsurvive until they could get back to Hobbiton - who there would believethat Frodo had willingly signed over Bag End to him?   "Since you've got the map," he asked casually, "have you any notionhow far there is still to go?"   "Uh, see, it's like this," Frodo answered.  "You know how Sauronkept sending me to those World Cultures and Geopolitics lectures?"   "Yes, and--?"   "Well, they kept impressing upon us how the political boundariesof Mordor, internal and external, were changing all the time,and the geography was in upheaval, too, what with it straddlingthe thrust fault zone that Mount V--"   "You threw away the map, DIDN'T YOU!  AAAAAARGH!"  In a fit ofrage Sam tackled to Frodo the ground and raised his fist to pummelthe hapless hobbit to a bloody pulp.  Before his hand descended,however, it occurred to Sam that killing Frodo would not helphim recover any information.  Instead he yanked the Phial ofGaladriel out of Frodo's jacket again and pressed it to Frodo'sforehead.  A cold sweat beaded across it instantly as Frodo squirmedto get away from the highly radioactive solution of radium andphosphorus isotopes.  Within moments he stopped writhing and beggingand became lucid.   "All right, here's what I remember from El Rond's maps inRivendell - bear in mind, this was made when Sauron was still inDon Guldur and so it's subject to change, and the elevation is stillnot as accurate as lat-long, but it's better than the propagandisticmaps on the Deed and the jammed GPS surveys that Jîvz showed me.I remember clearest that there was a place in the north where thewestern range and the northern range send out spurs that nearlymeet.  That must be over sixty miles from the bridge back by theTower.  It might be a good point at which to cross.  But ofcourse, if we get there, we shall be further than we were fromthe Mountain, about the same distance as from the bridge I shouldthink.  I guess that we have gone about thirty miles north fromthe bridge now, twenty-five to the outskirts of campus and eightyor so blocks cross-town through campus itself and over the highstreet before the tents.  Even if all goes well, we could hardlyreach the Mountain in a week.  I am afraid, Sam, that the burdenwill get very heavy, and you shall go still slower as we getnearer."   "You let me worry about that," answered Sam, withdrawing thePhial and carefully replacing it in the lead-lined pouch.  He'd haveto remember the Phial as a way of making people talk; perhaps theLady had done him a favor after all.  "Well, to say nothing ofwater, we've got to eat less, or else move a bit quicker, at anyrate while we're still in this valley.  One more bite and all thefood's ended, save the Elves' breakfast cakes."   "Come on then! Let's start another march!" said Sam for whatseemed the hundreth time.   "I'll try and be a bit quicker, Master," said Frodo, stillsupine, drawing a deep breath and shuddering in relief.   The trek continued interminably.  Still far away, forty miles atleast, they saw Mount Viagra, its feet founded in ashen ruin, itshuge cone rising to an artificially-maintained height, where itscaldera was swathed in cloud.  Its fires were now dimmed, and itstood in smouldering slumber, as threatening and dangerous as ahobbit's appetite between lunch and tea.  Behind it there hung avast shadow, ominous as a thesis defense, the veils of Barad-dur.The Dark Power had returned to this stronghold and was now deep inthought, and the Eye turned inward, pondering a high-resolutionvideoteleconferencing system: a bright sword, and a still-overweightbut now dignified face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great campus, gate on gate, and buildingon building, was wrapped in a brooding gloom.   It was not yet quite dark again.  They plodded along, on into thenight.  The hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few briefhalts as Frodo complained of a burning sensation on his temples.Sam looked at the "burns" and concluded that Frodo's hypochondria wasgetting the best of him.  At the first hint of grey light under theskirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in a darkhollow under an overhanging stone.   He gave Frodo water and an additional twinkie, and he made apillow of his jacket to squelch Frodo's incessant claims ofa splitting headache.  Sam did not bother to tell Frodo that hehad drunk the last drop of their water, and eaten Sam's share ofthe food as well as his own.  He expected as much gratitude fromhis former master as he did from Gandalf. When Frodo was asleep Sambent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face.With surprise he noted that Frodo's thick hair had begun to fallout in clumps, and that even the light fuzz on the backs of his feetwas thinning.   "Well, if he croaked, it would serve him right!"Sam muttered to himself.  "But I'll not have it on my head.  Waterwe must have, or he'll die of thirst before anything else does himin."   Sam, Frodo, and Gullible gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder onthis hateful land.  Between them and the smoking mountain, and aboutit north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned andchoked.  They wondered how the Lord of this realm maintained and fedhis research and teaching assistants.  Yet students he had.  As faras their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the Morgai and awaysouthward, there were camps of brightly-colored tents, some orderedlike small towns.  One of the largest of these was right below them.Barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest ofinsects, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drabbuildings.  At the western margin, a roundish green one made fromElvish-looking canvas read PUHJAFOONI/TELEFON.  About it the groundwas busy with folk going to and fro with a strange spring in theirsteps; a wide road ran from it south-west to join theMorgul-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes werehurrying.   "I don't like the look of things at all," said Sam.  "Prettyhopeless, I call it, saving that where there's such a lot of folkthere must be wells or water, not to mention food.  And these areMen, not Orcs, or my eyes are all wrong... wait, is that a BALROGdown there singing?"   Truth to tell, the trio could see the camp teeming with Men,Elves, dragons, and even a few Ents and Hobbits.  Neither he nor Frodoknew anything of the duchy of Nurn away south in this wide realm,full of graduate students toiling in the fields by the dark sad watersof Lake Nurnenshire, nor of the great roads that ran away east andsouth to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower broughtlong waggon-trains of chocolate and booty and new dwellers in the camp.Here in the northward regions were the mines and forges, and themusterings of a long-planned conspiracy; and here the Dark Power,moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathering themtogether.  Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, hadbeen checked upon its western line, southward and northward.  Forthe moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing themabout Cirith Goofy for an avenging stroke.  And if it had also beenits purpose to defend the Mountain against all approach, it couldscarcely have done more.   Frodo squatted upon the outer marge of this strange and wondrouscommune, or so it seemed to him.  He sat thus while long hourswere measured by the wheeling clouds above him, noticing onlybelatedly, when his stomach began to growl, that Sam and Gulliblehad beaten a hasty retreat.  The hills echoed with his plaintivewails.   Meanwhile, more than half a league away, Sam and Gullible hadhardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud theyheard orc-voices.  Quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brownand stunted bush.  The voices drew nearer.  Presently five orcscame into view.  Four were clad in all-weather parkas of the kindFrodo had just thrown away; they were small, slack jawed andsharp-eyed, with wide nostrils at which they picked with the handsthat were not holding their short bows: evidently trackers of somekind.  The other was a large bearded orc, like those of Lugnardo'scompany, bearing the token of the Eye upon a great white apron.He wore a tall, bouffant hat and carried a short blade in one handand a pronged weapon in his other.  As usual they were quarrelling,and being of different nationalities they used the Common Speechinstead of the tongues of their old countries or the cant of theirrespective character classes.   Hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orcsstopped.  "Screw you guys!" the plumpest one snarled.  "I'm goinghome."  It pointed across the valley to the orc-hold.  "I'm not gonnawear my nose out on stones any more.  There's not a trace left, man.I've lost the scent thanks to your body odors.  They went up into thehills, not along the valley, I tell you."   "Not much use are you, big fat ass?" said one of the other trackers,wearing a blue and red helmet adorned with the Lidless Eye.   "Yeah, snot-nose!" chimed another, wearing a light greenishleather helm.   The last of the trackers, zipped tightly into his hooded orangeparka, mumbled an unintelligible phrase that Sam suspected wasobscene.   "Oh, yah?" snarled the first tracker.  "Up yours!  You don't evenknow what we're looking for!"   "It's not our fault we got bad information!" shouted the secondtracker.   "Yeah, you heard the Nazdaq!  He said there were nine people anda dragon we were after: two dragon-riders; a barbarian; fourhalflings, one woman and three men; an orc; and an Emberite. What aload of BS!" concluded the third.   "Yeah, those guys are on crack!" agreed the second.   "You idiots!" said the first tracker.  "YOU'RE on crack!  TheEmberite probably isn't even IN this shade anymore, and I've seenonly three sets of tracks, so he probably took the dragon and fiveof the people with him!"   "What do YOU know, big fat ass?!" shouted the second tracker.   "Yeah," added the third.  "Maybe the dragon took to the air andis carrying the rest."  At this the fourth tracker mumbled hisassent.   "Respect my authoritah, or ah'm gonna report you!"   "Who to?  Not to your precious Lugnardo!  He's the first onethose dragon-riders knocked senseless on their way in to get thehalflings!" laughed the third tracker.   "Whassa matter, fat ass, can't take the heat?" mocked the second.   The other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage."Ah... hate you gahs... SO MUCH..." he choked as he drew his bow.Suddenly he pointed it at the other three and released. The firsttwo dodged swiftly, but the arrow struck the last tracker squarelyin the torso.  Black blood began to stain his parka as he slumpedsoundlessly to the ground.   "Lord of Darkness!  He killed Snaga!" cried the second orc.   "You bastard!" shouted the third.   "Kids, kids!" cried the big orc.  "It's all right... you know,hunting the forces of light reminds me of a song that HE taught usto sing, all the way back in the First Age..."     You say you serve the Master...     But who's the boss of you?     Not just any old bastard     Vampire or Balrog, fool!     You gotta know who owns your soul     And if you done forget his name     He'll throw you in a bottomless hole     'Cause baby, he's the King of PAAAAAAAAIIIIN!     Tell me who's your Dark Lord, baaaaaby?     Don't give me no ifs, buts, or maaaybes!     He'll show you why hate is fun     'Cause he's the King of the Night     Drown Manwe, Varda and the sun!     And he's sexy like a barrow wiiiiight!     Now don't he look smooth like an evil god...     Time to make sweet looooove and a little pod!"Oops, sorry, children," muttered the singer abstractedly.   At this, Sam and Gullible snapped out of their trancelikestupor.  For a while they had sat in silence, listening with amixture of wonderment, shock, disgust, and bemusement, unable toturn away.  Now, Gullible stirred.  "Pods!  Who would have thoughtit, eh, saddam?   If this nice friendlinesss would spread aboutin Mordor, half our trouble would be over."   But the large orc was not finished.  "Ladies and gentleorcs, Mr.Elton John!" he cried, still oblivious to any onlookers exceptthe trackers.   "Quickly, Gullible," Sam whispered.  "There may be others about!"The hobbits took their leave while the leaving was good.   As they trudged on, Sam continued: "We have evidently had a verynarrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than weguessed.  I feared it was so.  But that is the spirit of Mordor,Gullible; and it has spread to every corner of it.  Orcs have alwaysbehaved like that, or so all the stereotypes say, when they are ontheir own.  But you can't get much hope out of it.  They hate ourquaint agrarian and semi-pastoral culture far more than they lovetheir strange mix of high- and low-brow entertainment.  If thosefive had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel untilwe were back in Sauron's grip.  This is what I came to understandat Sauron's retreat."   There was another long silence.  Sam broke it again, but with awhisper this time.  "Did you hear what they said about 'three malehalflings'?  But that means..." and they both turned in unison asif to look at Frodo, who was now so far behind them that theycould hardly spot even a speck on the horizon.   "I feared it was so," said Sam uncharacteristically, "I tellyou, when I think of that Frodo I get so hot I could disintegratehim right on the spot!"   Slowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been.A strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor fromthe upper airs.  Before long the hobbits could make out the shape ofthe land for some miles about them.  The trough between themountains and the Morgai had steadily dwindled as it climbedupwards, and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf in thesteep faces of the Ethel Duwap; but to the east it fell as sheerlyas ever down into the south parking lot of the Mall.  Ahead thewater-course came to an end in broken steps of rock; for out fromthe main range there sprang a high barren spur, thrusting eastwardlike a wall.  To meet it there stretched out from the grey and mistynorthern range of Ered Lithography a long jutting mass of stoneshaped like a giant beak: Carach Malden.  Between the ends there wasa narrow gap: the Orthancmouthe, beyond which lay the deep dale ofUfat.  In that dale behind the Morononn were the tunnels and deeparmouries that the servants of Mordor had made for the defence of theBlack Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was gathering inhaste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the West.Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, andwatch-fires burned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had beenraised, and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by asingle bridge.   A few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spurbranched away from the main range, Sam and Gullible quaked at thesign of doom that stood before them: the old castle ofWolfenstein, now one of the many orc-holds that clusteredabout the dale of Ufat.  A road, already visible in the growinglight, came winding down from it, until only a mile or two fromwhere the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cutin the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and onto the Orthancmouthe.   To the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journeynorth had been for nothing.  The plain to their right was filledwith flames, and they could see there neither camps nor troopsmoving; but all that region was under the vigilance of the fortsof Carach Malden.   "We have come to a dead end, Gullible," said Sam.  "If we go on,we shall only come up to that orc-castle, but the only road totake is that road that comes down from it - unless we fight ourway through, level by level.  I was never any good at those 3-Dfirst-person shooters."   Gullible crept out wearily, and flitting from stone to stonewith more than hobbit-care, he went down to the water-course, andthen followed it for some way as it climbed north, until he cameto the rock-steps where long ago, no doubt, its spring had comegushing down in a little waterfall.  All now seemed dry andsilent; but not wanting to go back and listen to Sam's disturbednightmare-mumblings, he stooped and listened, and to his relief hecaught the sound of trickling.  Clambering a few steps up hespotted Frodo standing over a tiny stream of dark water that cameout from the hill-side, and realized with some annoyance what sourceof the sound was.   When Frodo had finished defiling the water, Gullible clambered afew yards further upstream and tasted it, and it seemed good enough.Then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back.   "Well, luck did not let uss down," he muttered, "but that was anear thing!  Isn't it enough to have orcses by the thousand AND thepeople of Gondor on their way without that idiot hovering about,saddam?  If we catches him again, I'll have to kill him myself, orhe'll give uss away, or even the Fat Lord, saddam!"  He sat down bySam and did not rouse him, for fear that he'd have to listen to anall-night bleating, griping, whimpering, so-you-can't-sleep moan-fest.Proletarian or bourgeois, these Hobbiton types were all alike...stark raving insane.  But the wretch did not dare to go to sleephimself.  At last, when he felt his eyes closing and knew that hisstruggle to keep awake could not go on much longer, he wakened Sam,cringing.   "That Frodo is back again, Mr. Samwise," he said.  "If it wasn't him,then there iss two of him - ach, ss! - forget we said that, preciouss!"   "What?!  You mean he was here?  But he could have killed me,Gullible!" cried Sam.  "Why didn't you track him down and stun him withmy phaser?  He could have given our position to the orcs!  You'll gladlystrangle your own kind with or without the Ring, but a murdering sneakthief, noooo, those are your kind of people, or should I say yourILK--" Sam spat.   Gullible shook his head.  "Plus ca change, plus c'est le meme chose,"he muttered, an aphorism he had learned while in Sauron's keeping.   Some twelve miles further they halted, resting at a bend in theroad. They had hardly started on their way again when suddenly in thestillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they hadsecretly dreaded: the noise of singing. It was still some way behindthem, but even without looking back at the torch-bearing line, theycould hear voices, some droning monotonically, some chanting out ofkey, all in rapid onset.   "I feared it, Gullible," said Sam, receiving a dirty look in return."We've trusted to luck, and it has failed us.  We're trapped at last!"he said.  He sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and fingeredthe safety catch of his phaser.  Gullible sat down wearily beside him.   They did not have to wait long.  The orcs were going at a greatpace.  This group, short and squat, seemed to have skin with alight blue tinge and the maws of the soldiers gaped to animpossible size.  Those in the foremost files bore torches.  Onthey came, red flames in the dark, swiftly growing.  Now Sam toobowed his head and covered their feet with backpacks, hoping thatit would hide their appearance when the singers reached them; butat length he realized that it was impossible to blend into thiscrowd.   "If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tiredstudents alone and pass on!" he thought.   And so it seemed that they would.  The leading orcs came lopingalong, panting, holding their heads down.  They were a gang ofthe smaller half-Toon breeds being driven unwilling to theirDark Lord's wars; all they cared for was to get the march overand be able to stop singing.     We don't want to look like Toons today     But the Animé Lords say "Nay, nay, nay!"     We're gonna sing all day, all day, all day!     Where there's some Dip there's a way!Beside them, hovering up and down the line, went two of the largefierce daleks, flicking wet brushes at the feet of the orcsand muttering "DIS-IN-TE-GRATE!".  File after file passed, and thetell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead.  Sam held his breath.Now more than half the line had gone by.  Then suddenly one of theslave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side.  He flicked abrush at them and yelled: "GET-UP!"  They did not answer, andwith a monotonic whistle he halted the whole company.   "REBELS OF MORDOR, THIS IS YOUR LAST OFFER - OUR FINAL WARNING.LEAVE YOUR RESTING PLACE.  JOIN THE WAR-MARCH.  YOU WILL BE FED ANDWATERED.  WORK IS NEEDED FROM YOU - BUT THE DALEK-HAI OFFER YOULIFE.  DESERT YOUR POST AND THE DALEK-HAI WILL DIP YOU ANDOBLITERATE YOUR INKS COMPLETELY.  YOU WILL DIE.  TRACKERS,SOLDIERS, PODS.  THE DALEK-HAI OFFER YOU LIFE!!!"   Feeling a strange animosity in response to the use of all-caps andmultiple exclamation points, they struggled to their feet, andkeeping bent, limping like footsore soldiers, they shuffled backtowards the rear of the line.  "NO-NO, NOT-AT-THE-REAR!!" theslave-driver shouted.  "RANK-THREE, FILE-TWO-AND-THREE!"  He senthis long Dip-impregnated brush whistling over their heads and theyfeigned fear; then with another long tone he started the company offagain at a brisk trot.   It was hard enough for poor Sam, who had painted the doors in BagEnd without adequate ventilation on many a summer evening; but forGullible it was a torment, and soon a nightmare.  He set his teeth,trying to stop his head from spinning at the fumes, and hestruggled on.  The stench of both inks and solvent dripping fromthe singing orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp andcough.  On, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw hisbreath and to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil endhe toiled and endured he did not dare to think.  There was no hopeof falling out unseen: Now and again the orc-driver fell back andbeeped at them.   "DIS-IN-TE-GRATE!" he jeered, flicking the brush at their legs."KEEP-SINGING!  WHERE THERE'S SOME DIP THERE'S A WAY!"  The voiceof the dalek held nearly no modulation.   They had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down along slope into the plain, when Gullible's strength began to give outand his will wavered.  He lurched and stumbled.  Desperately, Samtried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himselfhardly stay the pace much longer.  At any moment now he knew that theend would come: the weakling would faint or fall, and all would bediscovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain.  "I'll have that bigslave-driving monstrosity with this phaser, anyway," he thought.   Then just as he was putting his hand to the handle of the phasepistol, there came an unexpected relief.  They were out on the plainnow and drawing near the entrance to Ufat.  Some way in front of it,before the gate at the bridge-end, the road from the west convergedwith others coming from the south, and from Barad-dur.  Along all theroads troops were moving; for the Captains of the West wereadvancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his forces north.  So itchanced that several companies - Toons, half-Toons, and full-bloodedorcs - came together at the road-meeting, in the dark beyond thelight of the watch-fires on the wall.  At once there was greatjostling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gateand the ending of their songs.  Though the drivers yelled and pliedtheir dips (or whips), scuffles broke out and some gun arms weredeployed.  A troop of heavily-studded daleks from Barad-dur chargedinto the Durthang line and threw them into confusion.   Dazed as he was with the awful mind-numbing singing, Sam woke up,grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground,dragging Gullible down with him.  As they fell, one of the toon orcsbehind them was blasted by an enemy dalek gun and went spinninginto oblivion.  Slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away outof the escalating melee, until at last unnoticed they dropped overthe further edge of the road.  It had a magnetized guardrail bywhich even the headless troop-leaders could guide themselves, andit was banked up some feet above the level of the open land.   They lay still for a while.  It was too dark to seek for cover, ifindeed there was any to find; but Sam felt that they ought at least toget further away from the highways and out of the range of dalekbiosensors.   "Come on, ye git!" he whispered.  "One more crawl, and then you canlie still."   With a last despairing effort Gullible raised himself on his hands,and struggled on for maybe twenty yards.  Then he pitched down intoa shallow pit that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he laylike a dead thing.
  As the grey light of morning came again to Mordor, Sam woke and lookedabout the hollow where he and Gulible had taken refuge the previousnight.  A foul sump of oily water ringed with lurid algae lay at itsbottom, and as he slept Sam had slid down nearly to its edge.  Guliblewas nowhere to be seen.  Unwilling yet to move, Sam thought through the whirlwind of eventsthat had landed him in this unhappy place.  Affection, revenge, andsimple inertia had carried him this far, but weariness at last led himto frankly consider the task that lay ahead.  "Was this the job I was hired to do when I started?" Sam askedhimself.  "To help Mr. Frodo into his inheritance and then die withhim?  Well, that is my job, but I'm nowt but a ninnyhammer if I gothrough with it.  I would dearly like to see Bywater again, with Rosieleading the Revolution at my side.  Much as I'd like to see Mr. Frododraw his last breath, this quest is useless; it's high time I cut mylosses and head home.  "Still," he thought, "I can't think somehow that Gandalf and Elrondwould have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there hadn't a' been anyhope of his coming back with more money for them to take.  What do Ihave to show for all the work I've done these past months?  A deedsigned over that nobody will believe, Mr. Frodo gone so I can't bringhim back to the Shire to set off the Revolution, and a lot o' wastedblackmail that won't do no good either way.  If I'm to get anythingout of this at all, the Ring must go into the Fire and Frodo's got tolive through it... for a little while.  Why am I left all alone tomake up my mind?"  At that thought, Sam began to wonder where Gulible had gone.  Hebent his knees to stand, only to find that his feet had dipped downnear the water in the night and were now covered by a thin layer ofruby red growth, moist and sparkling in the growing daylight.  With acry he scraped the algae away as best he could, using dirt and gravelto scour it off.  Eventually the worst was gone, and all that was leftwas a light silvery sheen that persisted for days.  Sam walked up out of the hollow.  The land all about was dreary,flat, and drab-hued: a sparsly populated urban wasteland strugling tomaintain a meager existence between the inhabited regions of Mordor.Wide and featureless vacant lots, some dry and barren, some filledwith tall brown grasses, were interspersed with occasional buildings:broken and tumbled remnants of failed restaurants, motels, andconvenience marts lined the roads.  A few miles to the north-west, apair of long-abandoned apartment buildings stood like sombre greyghosts, for few would tolerate the long commute.  South-eastward, faroff like an erect sapphire tower, rose the Mountain.  Strange smokesspilled forth from its peak and rolled down its sides to the plainsbelow.  Nothing was moving in the direction of the crossroads where they hadmade their escape, but Sam thought he saw a distant hint of motion tothe east.  A great thoroughfare led that way: the road that led to theDark Tower itself.  Its golden cobblestones were worn and dirty withthe passage of many feet, but it remained in good repair, and takingcare not to be seen Sam nevertheless moved quickly.  Soon a small figure came in view, dancing wildly in the middle of thepath.  Sam crept forward stealthily, until finally he peered out frombehind a crumbling wall only to see that the flailing form was that ofGulible, who was not just dancing but singing as well.  He marvelledthat anyone other than Tom Bombadil could spout such nonsense.  Buthis amusement soon turned to alarm, for Sam heard far off a noise oftramping feet and harsh voices: Orcs were coming up the road fromBarad-dur, and soon Gulible's crazed behavior would mean discovery andtorture for them both.  Sam leapt from his hiding place and shoved the loony off the path,tackling him to the ground on the far side where they were hidden bythe tall growth.  As the maniac lay on the grass, Sam held his mouthclosed to keep him silent.  At first, Gulible struggled to break free,but as the Orcs drew nearer he went silent and limp.  Intent on theirdestination, the Orcs passed swiftly without so much as a glance toeither side.  Their voices receded into the distance, and Sam finallyremoved his hand allowed Gulible to speak.  "Ach, thanks," he said.  "We was thirsty, yess, and we sipped fromthe water where we slept."  At this, Sam realized that what he hadtaken for dirt on Gulible's face was in fact a residue of dull brownishmold.  "We thinks just a few sipses couldn't hurt, saddam, but onewas enough.  It tickled our throat, yes, and burned our brain intodust.  Dusst!  We didn't come to our senses until you knocked us down,no, saddam."  "Well," said Sam, "I've been thinking a bit, and I reckon that goingon to the Mountain will be the end of us, like as not.  Maybe we'dbest be getting away while there's a chance, and leave this drearyland to Sauron and Mr. Frodo."  "It mustn't say such things!" exclaimed Gulible with unexpectedforce. "The Precious must go into the Fire, yess, or else we'll neverbe normal again, no, saddam.  It gnaws at our mind all the time,saddam, near or far, filling us with longings and lusst.  If thePrecious goes we'll have a healthy brain again, yes, and p'raps otherrewards, too."  "But see here, Gulible: I want to get home again, and that's a fact.Throwing the Ring into the Mountain won't help much if we don't liveto enjoy it.  How can we get back once it's gone?"  "We'll tell you," he croaked, looking sidelong at Sam with a glintin his eyes.  "We has a plan, yes, a way back when the Precious isgone. All arranged in advance it is, yes, very secret, but we knows it.Let Don Giovanni show you!"  "A way back!" said Sam doubtfully, looking down at Gulible withsearching eyes.  "Why didn't you tell me about this, or Mr. Frodo?"  "You didn't ask, saddam.  But now you say: let's go home.  So DonGiovanni is very afraid.  He wants to be rid of the Precious, andwe're so close, yes, never have the chance again.  So Don Giovanniwill share his secret, saddam, when times is right."  "Gulible," Sam said, "I don't like trusting you, but it don't seemas I've got much choice, if I'm t' get any good out of this quest atall. We need to move quickly, so let's trust to luck again and followthe road.  We're off to seek the Mountain!"  The two travellers returnedto the path, heading east into darkness.  Days passed as the companions walked mile after bitter mile towardSauron's fortress.  Their provisions dwindled quickly, until they wereleft with no food but the twinkies of the Elves.  They did notsatisfy desire, or for that matter do much to keep the wanderers ontheir feet at all.  And yet as they relied on it alone, this waybreadof the Elves gained a potency that the travellers did not suspect, fortheir bodies were filled with preservatives, so that even after deaththeir corpses would endure beyond the measure of mortal kind.  More pressing was their need for water.  "Water, water!" mutteredSam, much to the frustration of Gulible who was trying to ignore his owngrowing thirst.  Neither of them were willing any longer to touch thefew dubious pools of standing water that lingered in scattered basinsbeside the road.  They had last filled their bottles at a fast foodFrench restaurant a day ago, but the exorbitant price of bottled waterin this harsh place had cost them their last penny; there was no hopeof any more.  Eventually, the road drew even with their goal: looming above theruins of an old motel on their right, the blue-tinged tower of MountViagra gleamed in the fading light.  Fumes and smokes began to taintthe air, adding to their thirst.  They sought shelter for the night inthe abandoned motel, but sleep long evaded them.  Dream and wakingmingled uneasily, a sure sign that their all-twinkie diet wasgetting the best of them.  As the night grew old, they were awakened by noises like the pitifulcries of a tortured thing.  Creeping through the ruins, they came upona wimpering creature dressed in Orcish garb lying stiff on the ground,its hands clenched into fists.  Tears seeped from its closed eyes, andit began to chant as if to itself: "I'd be tender, I'd be gentle, andawful sentimental regarding Orcish art!  I'd be friends with thebarrows and the Orcs who shoot the arrows if you wouldn't break myheart!  Just because you're presumin' that I am some kind-a-human, youwent and broke my heart!"  "Spiegel?!" exclaimed Sam.  "Who--Sam?" she replied, confused as she woke from her own uneasysleep.  Her voice still seemed full of the pain that had filled herdreams.  "What are you doing here?"  "That's what I was just going t' ask you," he said, holding Gulibleback.  A long, lingering hug from Don Giovanni seemed to be the lastthing she would need in her current state.  "We're off to theMountain.  But I thought you'd gone off with Corbin, and Gorbush."  "Corbin did just as he promised," she said, sitting up andstraightening the Orcish cloak around her shoulders.  "He took us to aworld where the Orcs were truly happy, where they could be their ownmasters, free from the hatred of foe and overlord alike that surroundsthem here.  Gorbush and I looked on that world with joy, but myhappiness was short-lived.  For the first time, Gorbush was among Orcswho were not slaves at heart: Orcish women with the same independentspirit that drew him to me.  The last I saw, he was chasing after someOrc-hussy named Lartip.  He never even said goodbye.  "When Corbin stopped by to visit, he offered to bring me back here.I just haven't had the heart to move yet; I feel all hollow and emptyinside.  I just want to sleep."  Wrapping her cloak tightly aroundher, Spiegel curled into a protective little ball on the floor.  Samand Gulible lay back down nearby, and they all tried to get such restas they could before the dawn.  The light of morning slowly filtered through the haze thatsurrounded the Mountain, and a dim semblance of daylight grew aboutthem. Gulible packed up their things, leaving behind some old blanketsand cooking supplies that they no longer needed.  Sam stood besideSpiegel, who was once again lying stiff and immobile on the ground."Wake up, Spiegel!" he said.  "Time for another journey."  She opened her eyes, but did not rise.  "I can't manage it, Sam,"she said.  "It is so hard to go on alone, so hard."  Sam knew before he spoke that such words might do more harm thangood, but his feelings for the girl were still strong and he could notkeep silent.  "Then come with us for a bit, Spiegel," he said.  "Youknow we'd welcome you, and gladly.  Where else would you go?"  "I wasn't sure," she replied.  "I thought at first that I might joinback with Sauron so that I could work to make the Orcs' lives betterhere; that's why Corbin dropped me off here near his tower.  But thenI thought of the happiness of the Orcs I had seen living free of hisdomination, and I couldn't bear to go back to him.  I don't know whatto do.  It's hard to make choices with a broken heart."  Sam nodded.  "It is," he said.  "But I've been thinking, maybe yourbroken heart could be healed by doing a good deed, by bringing freedomto all the Orcs in Sauron's realm.  Isn't helping them what you'vereally wanted all this time?"  "Yes," she said tentatively, "yes it is.  I don't need to be an Orcto help the Orcs!  I can love all the Orcish people even if my heartdoesn't belong to any of them."  She paused.  "Even if it belonged tosomeone else."  As if roused by a sudden bell, Spiegel rose quickly, and stood upand looked away southwards.  She threw off her black cloak, her heavybelt, and even her dress: all gifts from Gorbush.  She stood therelithe and beautiful, clad only in her undergarments, and her red hairand green eyes glinted in the dim light.  "There, I'll be an Orc nomore," she cried.  "Let him hate me, if he will.  We're off to seekthe Mountain!"  At last the three companions turned their faces to Mount Viagra andset out.  Their spirits were higher than could be expected from theirpoor night's sleep.  It helped that Spiegel had a little water toshare, the last of what was left for her by Corbin.  Even a mouthfulhelped tremendously, and the Mountain's fumes did not hurt theirthroats quite as much as they had the previous day.  In fact, Sam andGulible found that the tainted air seemed somehow to stiffen theirresolve, helping them rise to the challenge that lay before them.Spiegel felt no such inspiration, but she was not as weary as theywere, and drew fresh strength from her recovering spirits.  The land was rough and hostile, and yet they made much progress, andever the Mountain drew nearer.  No buildings were to be found here,far from the road, and the fields were overgrown and untended.  Latein the afternoon they walked through a field of poppies, and Sam wassurprised to find himself making a mental note to tell Morrie aboutthe prospects for opium exports here.  Now the bulk of Mount Viagraloomed vast before them: a huge mass of ash and slag wreathed inbluish fumes, out of which a sheer-sided shaft stabbed skyward intothe clouds.  All too soon the light began to fail, and the renewed hope andstrength that had carried them through the day began to falter in thegrowing dark.  Sam and Spiegel trudged slower and slower, and Guliblebegan to stagger as the harsh air and long march finally took theirtoll.  At the base of the Mountain, he sank down and said: "I'mthirsty, Sam," and did not speak again.  Sam gave him a mouthful oftheir precious water, and Gulible quickly fell into a deep sleep, hisbreath rattling in his chest.  Sam and Spiegel tried to rest as well, but all the doubts that theyhad set aside in the light of day came back to haunt them that night.As they both tossed and turned, Sam's spirits sank lower than they hadin days.  Tears welled in his eyes at the thought that he might neversee his Rosie again.  Desperate to focus on a pleasant thought, hespoke quietly to Spiegel: "Do you remember our time in the hot towerin Disgiliath, the day we met the eagle?"  For several slow heartbeats, Spiegel was silent.  "I know that suchthings happened," she finally said, "but it seems so very long ago.Since Gorbush left me, no taste of food, no feel of water, no memoryof tree or grass or flower have any meaning for me."  She paused for amoment, and then two.  "I am naked in the dark, Sam."  The seconds passing in the night seemed endless, timeless.  At lasthe groped for Spiegel's hand.  It was cold and trembling.  She wasshivering.  "I didn't ought to have left my blanket behind," muttered Sam; andlying down he tried to comfort Spiegel with his arms and body.  Sleeptook them, and the dim light of the last day of their quest found themside by side, as slowly the light of the unseen Sun filtered down intothe shadows where the three hobbits lay.  "Wake up, wake up!  Wake up, sleepies!" Gulible croaked, clawing atSam and Spiegel where they lay.  "No time to lose.  We must go, yes,we must go at once.  No time to lose!"  Spiegel sat up suddenly andseized him by the arm, and then pulled herself to her feet.  Samgroaned, but with a great effort of will he staggered up as well.  Asense of urgency which he did not understand came to him, and he sawthat the others also seemed to have felt the call.  "We sees something," Gulible whispered nervously, "something movingaround the base of the Mountain, saddam.  Don Giovanni tries tofollow, saddam, but it was tricksy, yes, and it slipped away."  "Could it have been Mr. Frodo?" Sam asked.  "Frodo?" asked Spiegel.  "I assumed he had gone back to study withSauron.  What would he be doing here?"  "He got distracted, yes, went off on his own," answered Gulible."Maybe he wants to help destroy the Precious."  Turning to Sam, hesaid, "P'raps it was him, yes, but it looked too big.  More like awraith, saddam, tall and pale, or some other nasty thing.  Maybeeven the Dark Lord himself, saddam."  With Gulible's warning, they all began to peer nervously from side toside.  "Frodo and Sauron an wraiths, oh my!" Spiegel exclaimed, andthose fears drove them to press on.  The three companions began to ascend the base of the Mountain.  Therewhere it met the plain, the air was full of fumes, making breathingpainful and difficult.  Sam and Gulible found that the enhanced vigorthat had sustained them the previous day had given way overnight to apainful tension with no hope of release, and Spiegel began to choke onthe foul air.  As they went on, one by one they slipped to the groundand crawled on their hands and knees, until at last their wills coulddrive them no further and their limbs gave way.  They lay together on the slope, panting for breath.  They soonrealized that they had climbed more than half way up the Mountain'sbase, and had risen above the worst of the reeks that coiled anddrifted down below.  Their strength gradually returned.  After a fewminutes, Gulible asked, "How far iss there to go?"  "I don't know," said Sam, "because I don't know where we're going."  Slowly, Gulible and Spiegel turned to face Sam, as the disbelief ontheir faces changed to raw anger.  "You WHAT?" yelled Spiegel.  Hersudden fury seemed to bring her new strength.  "You DON'T KNOW?  Youbrought us all the way here to destroy the Ring without knowing whatto do when we got here?  Were you going to mention this at some point,or did you plan to wait until we'd climbed to the very top of thisblasted slagheap?"  "I thought it would be obvious!" Sam answered.  "I mean, how hardcould it be to find the Cracks of Doom once we got here?"  The othersjust stared.  "Frodo was the one who learned all the maps!"  "Well he's not here now," said Spiegel.  "Yes, he is," said a voice.  Turning, they saw a shocking sight:before them stood Frodo, but grotesquely changed.  Whatever strangeand dreadful paths he had trodden, driven by a devouring desire, theyhad left grievous marks on him.  Fully six feet tall he stood, thinand haggard, all bones and tight-drawn skin.  There was no hair to beseen anywhere on his body, and there were open sores on his forehead.He wore nothing but a scrap of cloth wrapped about his loins, and hissparkling white stone dangled on a chain about his neck.  A wild, madlight flamed in his eyes.  "Give me the Ring!  Once it is gone, theNurnenshire estate will be mine!  Give it to me!"  "Frodo, what happened?" asked Sam.  "What in Middle-earth hashappened to you?"  The overgrown hobbit paid no attention.  Towering over Sam he cried,"It is mine, I say!  Give me the Ring, NOW!"  "I don't have it," said Sam, as calmly as he could manage.  "You WHAT?" yelled Spiegel and Gulible together, staring at him ineven greater amazement than before.  "Then where is it?  Tell me!" demanded Frodo.  "I'm really not sure," said Sam, relishing his old master'sfrustration.  "But I know for a fact that either you have it, orGulible does."  Gulible yelped with surprise and fear as the gigantic Frodo whirledto face him.  "No, no, saddam, we doesn't have it, we doesn't."  Frodo was not appeased.  "Now, now!" he gasped, clutching at Gulible'sbreast.  "Now, you creeping thing, give me the Ring!  You cannotbetray me now!"  So strange was the tableau that it seemed to Sam that he saw thesetwo rivals with some bizarre other vision.  A crouching shape, scarcelymore than a shadow of his younger self, a creature now wholly raggedand dejected, yet filled with great confusion and fear; and before itstood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure hairless and white, butfrom deep in its gut there came a resounding growl.  Out of the growlthere spoke a commanding voice.  "Hand over the Ring, and trouble me no more!  If you touch it everagain, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom."  The crouching shape shrank away, terror in its blinking eyes, when anew figure came in view.  It was Spiegel, and she reached up high andslapped Frodo squarely on the cheek.  "Shame on you!" she scolded,staring up at him with her hands on her hips.  "What did you do that for?  I didn't hurt him," said Frodo, beginningto cry.  "You didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nosebleeding?"  "Well, of course not.  What a fuss you're making!  When you goaround picking on people weaker than you are... why, you're nothing buta great big coward!"  "I know," he sobbed, "I know.  I've felt so odd lately... I feel allthin, sort of stretched.  And my head is always hurting, and I'vebeen hounded by foul-mouthed Orcs, and I haven't slept in days... andnow you've all gotten so short and you're keeping the Ring from me andI'll never get my estate need to destroy it before I get the estateI'm thirsty very thirsty hungry all being so cruel don't know what todo..."  He fell flat upon the ground and whimpered.  "It's because of the Precious," guessed Gulible.  "He's like thisbecause of the nasty Ring, yes, and the sooner we get rid of it, thesooner he'll rest, saddam.  Now where iss it?" he asked, turning toSam.  "I fed it to one of you in a twinkie," Sam admitted.  "I don't knowwhich.  But I figure you're right: destroying the Ring will probablybe good for him.  Not that I'd mind if it wasn't!"  Sam looked at Frodo.  "Oh, curse you, you imperialist pig!"  hemuttered to himself.  Out loud, he asked, "Can you take us to theCracks of Doom?  Do you know the way?"  Frodo lifted his head, with only a trace of hope in his eyes.  Hespoke quietly, almost in a whisper.  "Yes, I will come.  There's apath not far up the slope from here; it will take us where we need togo."  They helped him to his feet, and as they all began to climbagain, Frodo gazed up and ahead.  "We're off to seek the Mountain!" hesaid.  They soon reached the path that Frodo had spoken of.  They did notknow it, but it was in fact the tail end of Sauron's Road fromBarad-dur, the same gold-paved road that they had followed before,eastward from Ufat toward the Dark Tower.  The four of them walkedslowly but with confidence up that climbing road, winding back andforth up the mountainside.  With a last eastward bend, it passed in acutting along the face of the shaft and came to the dark door in theMountain's side.  Facing that door across the intervening miles, the pinnacle ofBarad-dur seemed to gaze directly on the hobbits.  The hobbits paidlittle attention, focusing instead on the terrible door.  For a momentthey stood at the gaping mouth, their hearts beating with nervousfear, and then they plunged in, giving no thought to the Freudianimplications of that act.  Fearfully, they took a few uncertain steps into the dark, and thenall at once there came a flash of purple: vivid red fires leaped upwardand smote the high blue roof.  As the light flashed, a deep voice sangas if from nowhere and echoed about the cavern:    "DOOM!  The Cracks... of DOOM!"They all spun around, this way and that, but no trace of a singercould be seen.  When a few moments had passed without further musicalaccompaniment, they all relaxed.  "This is a mighty strange place,"said Sam, "and that's a fact."  In the flash, they had seen that theywere in a long tunnel that bored straight into the Mountain's hotcenter.  Only a short way ahead, its floor and the walls on eitherside were split by a great fissure, out of which the purple glarecame, now leaping up, now dying down exhausted; and all the while farbelow there was a continuous groaning noise as of great enginesthrobbing and laboring.  They walked to the brink of the chasm, to the very Crack of Doom,and just as they reached the edge the light sprang up again, and thedeep ringing voice returned to its ominous song:    "The Chambers of Fire... the Fires of DOOM.""That could get a bit annoying," said Sam.  Frodo, his unnaturally tall body silhouetted against the pulsatinglight, now spoke in a compelling voice.  "Who now is the bearer of theRing?  The wearer of the Ring?"  The others hung their heads, but saidnothing: they were filled with thoughts of darkness and despair, andthey had no answer for him.  "Beware!  Its mighty power has yet to beshown!"  Frodo turned to them in madness and anger, ready to take theRing from its bearer by force if need be.  He lunged forward, but hadno chance to act, for at that moment many things happened.  A great rush of wind came from outside, a sound like the beating ofvast wings.  At the same time, something struck Sam violently in theback, a huge ball that bowled all four of them to the ground.  It slidwith terrible speed toward the fissure, and slipped in... only tobecome lodged in the crack by virtue of its considerable girth.Slowly, arms and legs reached out and grasped for purchase on thenearby rocks.  Then, the obese man raised his head.  It was Gandalf.  "Fat Lord!" said Gulible, "I've brought them here, yes, just asI was told.  The Precious, too, and we're ready to throw it in,saddam.  Only..."  The wizard tried to pull himself up out of the crack, but the samebulk that had saved him remained caught on the jagged rock at itsedge.  Gulible ran forward and began to help pull him to safety.  AsGandalf twisted and Gulible tugged, a sudden tearing sound was heard,followed by the sound of a balloon quickly deflating.  Gandalfstruggled up into the tunnel with his robes now hanging loose abouthim and a great punctured inner tube drooping below them to theground.  "Only what?"  he asked.  "Only the nasty hobbit put it in our food, saddam!" said Gulible,getting the words out in a rush.  Gandalf surveyed the situation, consternation on his face.  Thenwith a suddenness that startled them all he started laughing!  "Eatme to be tall!" he cried.  "Of course, of course!"  With an evil lightin his eye, he jumped on Frodo and tried to drag him into the fissure.  Sam and Spiegel lay on the floor of the tunnel in shock, still dazedfrom their fall and the strange events that had followed.  Whatfollowed transpired so quickly that they had no chance to act, butcould only watch in awe and horror.  Frodo on the edge of the abysswas fighting like a mad thing with his murderous foe.  Gandalf pressedhim hard, but Frodo's newfound size gave strength to his desperationand he began to make progress, fighting his way away from the Fire.  Suddenly, Gulible leapt into the fray, grabbing Frodo's knees andtripping him.  The three combatants swayed to and fro, so near thebrink that they almost tumbled in, and then they all fell to theground.  Gandalf landed on top of Frodo, and as Frodo struggled torise Gandalf tried to keep him down.  He grabbed hold of the chainaround Frodo's neck and choked the hobbit to the floor, but with asharp twist the chain snapped and came loose in Gandalf's hand.However, the wizard did not lose his grip, but caught hold of Frodo'sshoulders and pinned him to the ground.  They were locked in astalemate: Frodo could not rise, but Gandalf could not budge himtoward the Fire.  But they had forgotten Gulible!  As Gandalf pinned Frodo's shouldersand prevented his escape, Gulible clawed at his belly.  Suddenly Samsaw Gulible's hands spread apart; his white teeth gleamed, and thensnapped as they bit.  Frodo began to scream in horror and agony, forGulible continued gnawing into Frodo's gut, searching for the Ring.The screaming went on and on, and then Gulible leapt to his feet,crying out in triumph with the Ring clenched between his teeth.Gandalf turned to look, and at that moment Frodo lashed out with afoot and kicked Gulible in the groin.  Gulible gasped with pain, and then went wide-eyed in terror as,gulp, down went the Ring into his own throat.  They all stared athim, as he began to gibber at them, shrinking back toward the chasm infear.  "No, no, saddam, it didn't happen.  It can be fixed, yes.We'll throw up the Ring!  Just give us a little time, just a little,saddam!"    Frodo stared up at Gulible with a hungry, greedy gaze.  "No, Frodo,"gasped Gulible, recognizing his deadly peril and the thread upon whichhis doom now hung, "search your feelings!"  Then Frodo stirred and spoke with a greedy voice, a voice louder andmore piercing than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above thethrobs and groans of the Mountain, ringing in the roof and walls.  "Iwill not wait now to do what I came to do," he said.  "I will notawait the Ring.  The Deed is mine!"  And Frodo kicked Gulible firmlyin the knees.  He toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and thenwith a shriek he fell.  Out of the depths came his last wail, and hewas gone.  With a great roar, fires leapt up and licked the roof as the Ring andits final bearer were consumed.  Gazing through the door into thedistance they saw a vision of ruin: towers fell and mountains slid;walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke andspouting steams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like anoverwhelming wave; and then at last over the miles between there camea rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook; andwe all desperately wished that we didn't now have such a tragically,horrifyingly vivid understanding of this scene.  They all stared out the door at the cloud of black dust that cloakedthe ruins of Barad-dur, stared until the last rumblings of itscollapse died away.  They all knew that no body could survive thatdevastation: for good or ill, Sauron was no more.  Sam, Spiegel, andFrodo all looked at each other with guarded hope: were their goals inreach at last?  Were they worth the price?  Then, out of the darkness by the Crack of Doom there came anunexpected sound: Gandalf had begun to laugh an evil laugh.  Thehobbits turned to face him, and for the first time saw that he worethree glittering Rings on his right hand.  Nenya, the Ring ofZirconium, nabbed from Galadriel's nightstand while she was helpingCeleborn to dress himself.  Pinta, the Ring of Tinted Glass, won fromEl Rond in a game of cards after he was convinced it would lose itspowers when the One was destroyed.  And Dubya, the Ring of HeNe,"borrowed" from Cirdan two thousand years ago when Gandalf claimed tohave misplaced his laser pointer right before giving a lecture.  "Sauron is dead," he said.  "I can sense it.  I can sense it!  TheRings give me powers beyond my wildest dreams, and my last rival forthe Overlordship of Middle-earth is no more!  What can I not do inthis hour?  The Rings will give me power of Command!"  The wizardbegan to stride up and down along the abyss, speaking ever moreloudly.  He seemed to have entirely forgotten Frodo and the others,and his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the mustering of men.  Ashe spoke, the aura of power about him seemed to grow stronger andstronger, almost as if evil energy was visibly flowing into his body.The hobbits cowered away from him in growing fear.  After several minutes, he reached a fevered pitch.  "Then I willbring the might of Gondor down on the Easterlings.  Once they are mysubjects, it will be time for the greatest crusade yet, for we shallwipe the vile race of Orcs from the face of the world."  At this,Spiegel choked, but said nothing.  He went on, "After scouring theirilk from Mordor, it will be easy to sweep on to the south and captureHarad.  And then, oh yes, then it will be time to turn on the Elvesand pay them back for all the humiliation they've caused me over theyears.  I will raze all of their precious forests!  I'll see them cutto the ground one by one, even if it takes all the saws here in Mordorto do it!"  As Gandalf spoke those words, a bright glow sprang up from his lefthand and it became more brilliant by the second.  Before Gandalf hadmore than a moment to register the light coming from Frodo's stone, abloodcurdling shriek tore through the chamber.  "MINE!"  A blade whirled and flashed in the growing light as Maglor leapt fromhis hiding place in the shadows and charged straight at Gandalf.Startled, the wizard stepped back and raised his right hand to strikethe Elf down with his Rings of Power.  He stepped too far.  With a cry, he tumbled backwards, arms spinning,even as Maglor slashed at his falling body.  No longer protected byhis balloon padding, the wizard plunged into the fiery pit and wasdestroyed.  As the Three Rings perished with their wearer, flames thrice asintense as before burst forth from the depths of Mount Viagra,liquifying the roof of the cavern and bathing Maglor and the hobbitsin an unholy radiance.  Fire belched from the Mountain's summit, andthe earth began to shake.  Through all this, Maglor didn't move, butstood staring down at the crack where Gandalf had fallen.  The hobbitsfelt no such compulsion to stay: Sam and Spiegel lifted Frodo, who hadfinally collapsed from pain and exhaustion, and carried him out thedoor.  "Well, this is the end, Sam Gamgee," said a voice by his side.  Andthere was Spiegel, pale and tired and yet herself again, the lovelyhobbit lass Sam had shared such joy with in Disgiliath.  The Orcs hadbeen saved from both slavery and extermination; her burden was takenaway.  "Spiegel!" cried Sam, and taking her in his arms he kisssed her onthe lips.  For in this moment he thought nothing of Rosie or of theRevolution to come, but only this: here and now, they were alive.  "I am glad you are here with me," said Spiegel.  "Here at the end ofall things, Sam."
  "What are they?" Aragon asked and stared out over the milling crowds.Their joyous squeals and raucous hollers reached even the highest tower,their brightly coloured garments could not be ignored by the mostcolourblind of absent minds. Gondor had indeed been invaded.  "Don't worry about it, dear," Arwen said and put her arm over a smallportion of his shoulders. "The people of Mordor have a right to be jollyafter decades of hardship and high culture, haven't they? If they want tolook outrageous, so be it. Now put on that costume and let me have a lookat you!"  Aragon sighed and wriggled into a pair of very green tights. "I can't say Ilike performing for Orcs," he said. "Not to mention the Southrons; they laughand make obscene gestures at me."  Arwen gave him a motherly smile. "It's their culture, darling!" sheexplained. "And remember, they aren't called Orcs or Southrons anymore. Keepyour manners and call them Mordorians - please?"  She helped him button his shirt, a voluminous tent gleaming venomously likethe skin of a serpent dying from envy, and the matching vest in avocado.Aragon gave himself a quick glance in the wall-covering mirror, then lookedaway with a grimace. "I don't like this," he said. "I don't like it at all."He attempted to make the puppy-eyed face that made her heart melt likemarshmallows in a campfire, but all the green seemed to take away its effect.  "Yes, my snake, it is necessary," Arwen said firmly. "We couldn't possiblythrow away a golden opportunity like this. Ariëlle has hinted that we mightget even higher positions here, if we perform well and she decides to go on amission to save the world or something. Who knows, we might be King and Queenof Gondor yet!" She threw off her cape, and stood before him in a silverbathing suit and feathers and little else. "And until that day, we will bethe Fairy King and Queen of Goldywood." She gave a wry smile. "Isn't itamazing how these concept writers can twist and pervert the most simpleidea?"  "There will be no twisting or perversion in my Gondor!" Ariëlleexclaimed cheerfully as she barged into the room without knocking. "Unlessthey can come up with a new way of twisting that fits the Park's concept, ofcourse. Hey, what do you think about these? 'Buy your own Ring ofDestruction'." She held out a tray of brightly coloured rings and a wizardlydoll that looked somewhat like Gandalf. "He's fully de- and reflatable," shesaid proudly as Arwen reached out to touch his rubbery features.  "Uh - wasn't it called the Ring of Seduction?" Aragon asked serpently,shifting uncomfortably in his new costume.  Ariëlle just gave him a stare. "What kind of place do you think this is?"she asked sternly. "And may I kindly request you not to adjust your pantsin public? It's not fitting." She looked at her watch, which was large andsparkly and decorated with a miniature replica of Gondor. "All right,lovedoves, it's time," she said with a grin. "Break a leg, huh?"  Aragorn put on his mask, which, at three times the size of his head, wasin perfect proportion with his body. "Ho ho ho. I'm a fat, happy wood elf,"he said grimly, and slithered out to face the people, Arwen balancing behindhim on heels high enough to suit any Fairy Queen. Snip, snap, snout, went thecameras of the Mordorians, and their money tickled merrily into the foodstalls and souvenir shops of Gondor.   Ariëlle returned to her office. It was brightly lit by force of the greatwindows covering the entire wall overlooking the theme park. It was alsoeerily quiet, due to the sound-proofing properties of the same windows.Ariëlle, undisputed heiress to the magical kingdom of Gondor, satleisurely down at her desk and started looking through all the plans for newmerchandise and better rides. She loved plans; they always seemed to come outin her favour.  "That's a good one," she muttered softly as she examined the suggestion ofelongating Boromir's Ghostride with reappearing hobbit toons as well. "Yes,hobbits are good for many things," she mused, and pushed her Silmarilanbuzzer button. Morrie and Pipsqueak came in at once, Pipsqueak's facebrimming with adolescent love, Morrie still with a calculating look in hiseyes. "Any news of the Halflings?" she asked.  Pipsqueak jumped up and down and squeaked excitedly. Morrie gave him a coldstare. "They're safe, Madame," he informed. "Frodo is filled to the brim withdrugs and ravin' delirious. Sam and Spiegel are... uh... in their room." Hegrimaced. "Kalessin has said his union will contact us about compensation forthe trip. Apparently, Frodo made dying noises the entire time, and the othertwo... well."  "Thank you, my loyal Three-quarts," Ariëlle said pleasantly. "I shall takecare of everything. You have served me well." She followed them out with hergaze, and smiled as she saw Pipsqueak lean on Morrie in a swooning fashion."So susceptible," she thought, absent-mindedly fondling her Silmaril.   In Mordor, the colours of Death and Passion were in power. Volcanic fireleapt from ramshackle house to abandoned car-wreck, black smoke packingitself thicker than ever in the sky. All living things had fled the land forthe pleasures of Gondor and other attractions. The ones that were leftwere the half-living, the scavenging creatures; sneering rats, great, buzzingflies and cockroaches, and spiders.   "Veer iz hee, my darlinks?" The woman veiled in black paused and, strikinga decorative pose against the burning sky, followed her scuttling companionswith her gaze. They were headed towards a mound of shrapnel greater than theothers, a dazzling creation of broken steel reinforcement and glasssplinters, a sculpture protesting the destruction of war made by no man'shand. "Aiii!" wailed Shelob, and ran elegantly towards the wreckage.  One little spider can do nothing, perhaps. But hundreds, or thousands,nourished on flies grown fat on junk food and fighting, can accomplishplenty. Shelob's black warriors spun and fastened, pulled and moved, untilthe mound was opened. Many perished as unstable bits gave way and tumbled,but they were all ready to fulfill the last request of their Liberal Lady."Sztop!" she called out suddenly. "You leaf me nov, all ov you. You hev beenvonderful." She waited for the spiders to disappear, then gingerly made herway up the pile.  All was still.  "Szveethart? Veer ar you?" Shelob murmured softly. She listened. Was that amoan she heard? A moan known to her and loved by her, from happier times thanthese? She walked around the last unbroken wall of Sauron's tower until shefound what she was looking for. It was a door, amazingly whole and stillsealed shut. The Spider Queen reached out her hand to touch it, andsoundlessly, the door swung open. Shelob gave a tentative smile and entered.  "Aglunph," Sauron responded eloquently as his saviour carefully draggedhim out of the room and away from the disintegrating heap. She laid the formerDark Lord out on the ground and kissed his forehead with her sticky lips.Slowly he opened his lidless eyes and looked at Shelob, then let them lingerat the remnants of his tower. "I've always wanted eventful dreams," he said."But don't you think this is a little bit over the top?"  "Shussh, darlink," Shelob hissed lovingly, and stroked his hair. "Your toverwaz razer vell built, vas it not? But zis iz zee ent ov it, I vear."  Sauron winced and sighed. "I guess that is so," he said. "My plan has failed,and I have failed with it. You should have let me rest in my tower, my dear."  Shelob tutted and gently shook his head. Sauron groaned with pain. "But don'tyou szee?" she asked smilingly. "Nov, at last, you are vree." She stared athim and saw his features soften, as gradually many great loads left his wearyshoulders. "I don't feel the incessant need to wogah!" he exclaimed. "And...the Orcs! I don't need to control them, not one little bit. I feel great!" Hetried to sit up, but fell back with a thump. Yet he was still not beaten. "Ifeel like singing!" he said, and drew in his breath deeply. Shelob gently hithis head with a rock, then lifted up her unconscious love and went to searchfor shelter in the wasteland.  "What did she say to you?" asked Sam after the interview with Ariëlle wasover. Spiegel only smiled dreamily and went over to the mirror.  "Do you think my hair looks best free or tied up?" she said as she startedbrushing.  "Your hair looks great no matter how," Sam stated matter-of-factly, andadded, for emphasis, "And that's a fact." He sat meaningfully down on the bed,but Spiegel appeared not to notice.  "So what are you doing tonight, then?" she asked.  "Mm...me?" Sam was flabbergasted. "I thought I was going with you to seethe Parade... together with you," he explained.  Spiegel finished brushing and opened a box of makeup which she startedapplying with great skill. "I'm sorry, Sam," she said. "I'm going to be inthe parade. Ariëlle has offered me work here as a Beauty Queen. Imaginethat - me, a Miss Gondor! Who would have thought?" She decorated her eyesin silence for a while, then turned around to look at Sam. She was just intime to see the door closing softly behind him.  "How are ye, Master Frodo?" Sam asked, unexpectedly feeling a deep longingfor his old, simple life in the Shire. Frodo started, opened his eyes, andgiggled.  "I had such a wonderful dream!" he said. "I was hatching giant butterfliesfrom my stomach. Oh, it's you, Sam," he added as he slowly came somewhat tohis senses.   "Yes," said Sam. "I'm glad that you are here with me," he muttered inaudibly."Here at the end of all things, Master."  "I say, Sam," Frodo exclaimed jofully. "You do look a bit like acaterpillar! But whenever did you decide to colour your hair purple? Youlook most droll!" He smiled contentedly and sunk down on his pillow.
  Gondor had been experiencing a downturn in business of late.  In the weeks since the Rohirrim had left, the gradual flow of cash into the coffers of Ariellë's merchandising empire had shrunk dramatically.  The Rohirrim had parted rather grumpily, some mourning the death of HeyHoDen, others off to help Eowynn prepare her paternity suit, and the remainder simply happy to get back to whatever it was they did with their horses in peacetime (Pipsqueak hoped it was showjumping, but Morrie had told him not to be so naive).  The flood of customers from Mordor had also subsided a little, due mostly to their growing awareness of just how extortionate Ariellë's new pricing policy was, even for a family orientated theme park.  However, the CEO of Gondor Entertainment Inc. still had a trick up her sleeve to drag in the punters.  Along with Acting Deputy Executive Vice Presidents Morrie and Pipsqueak, she had concocted a plan to alter the face of the entertainment industry for years to come.  She had planned a pageant to end all pageants - The Crowning of The New Queen of Gondor!  Through many long nights of deep thought - although Pipsqueak's mind was often elsewhere (I would go into more detail but this is purportedly a family e-text and, well...) - they concocted the plans for the most spectacular spectacle ever spectated.  Two days of non-stop feasting, parades, fireworks and toon-based entertainment were to climax in the Crowning ceremony, of which Ariellë herself would be the star.  However, much work was needed to iron out a few minor problems, such as parking arrangements and the particularly unusual sanitary requirements of the Southrons.  The Crowning was to involve the now much slimmer Aragon, the increasingly reclusive Sam (representing the still-slightly-delirious Frodo as ringbearer) and Spiegel, who was rapidly becoming something of a minor star in her own right and whose first movie was already being planned.  Nobody had been able to find Boromir, but then again, nobody seemed to care.  The festival was a great triumph for manufactured entertainment.People flocked in from hundreds of miles around to eat drink and be merryin the streets of the citadel.  Eric the small cat was a huge success, as were Spiegel and Her Elvish Dancing Girls - a suggestion of Giggly - albeit with a slightly different section of the crowd.  Strangely, though, Sam was nowhere to be seen during Spiegel's act, or for a good while afterwards - the two of them hadn't been talking too much of late.   It was only after a thorough search had been organised that he was found, much to Morrie's relief, wandering aimlessly around the streets and occasionally being pelted with fruit by Orcish children.  Ariellë sat atop a tall throne at the centre of the stage, smiling sweetly, the focus for the attention of thousands of eagerly watching eyes.  To her left stood Aragon, more than an hint of jealousy in his eye,  and a slightly ruffled Sam, hastily rushed through make-up, and to her right Spiegel, the two hobbits having been carefully placed on different sides of the throne to avoid any 'complications'.  A lively, badly dressed MC was leaping around, yelling seemingly random phrases and still managing to evoke a cheer from the audience.  In the wings, between Morrie and Pipsqueak, waited the old and rather befuddled High Priest in Charge of Crowning and the Official Whopping Big Crown of Gondor."So, how are all you happy little people?!" yelled the MC to nobody in particular, and at once became the recipient of a huge, incoherent roar.   "Glad to hear it!!  Well, floks, it's the moment we're all here to see - the once in a lifetime event that is... Ttttthhhhhhheeeeee Ccccccrrrrooooowwwwnniiinnngggg!!!!!!"  Once again, a mighty cheer went up, loud enough to make everyone onstage (including the MC) cringe, but yet seemed to have very little effect on Ariellë who sat smiling away to herself, apparently unaware of the tumult.  The MC bounded away into the wings, and in his place appeared the frail, rather less hip figure of the High Priest.  He had been persuaded, by means unknown to all except Morrie, to shorten the traditionally seven hour ceremony to a single line, and seemed a little too eager to get it all over with.  He was followed by the two Executive hobbits, carrying between them the extravagant, vastly oversized, and really rather gaudy Crown of Gondor, which apparently been made for ancient kings who were more of Aragon's original proportions than Ariellë's.  From somewhere backstage came the blast of a hundred mighty trumpets. "All rise for Queen Ariellë!" shouted Morrie and Pipsqueak in unison, and a deadly silence fell across the onlookers.  Ariellë, however, seemed unmoved by all of this, and sat quietly grinning at nothing in particular.  "People of this city," muttered the priest regretfully to himself, before loudening up a little at a glance from Morrie.  "Friends from distant lands and purchasers of kitsch merchandise, I present to you Ariellë, the New Queen of The Magic Kingdom of Gondor!"  With one disgruntled gesture he snatched the crown from Morrie and placed it on top of her head to great cheers from the crowd.  However, Ariellë herself did not seem very impressed at all with the performance.   She sat in stony silence, her grin now appearing to take on almost manic enthusiasm.  The High Priest looked shocked, and hurried down to Morrie.  "We could have a bit of a problem here," he whispered. "She appearsto be dead."  "Dead?  What do you mean, dead?"  "Dead.  She's kicked the bucket. Gone.  Popped her clogs.  Vamoosh."  "If this is some kind of joke, you'll be tomorrow's FairyBurger meat." Morrie hurried up to the throne, felt Ariellë's neck, and then leantdown and whispered to Pipsqueak, "You know what?  She is dead!"  "Dead?  DEAD!  How can she be dead!  It's so... so sad..."  He fellto the floor, wailing.  A loud murmur swept through the crowd.  Spiegel looked stunned and Aragon uncertain.  Sam, however, seemed impassive, and didn't seem particularly shocked.  "I know, I know.  She was the star attraction.  But there's no need to make all that fuss... we always have Plan B to fall back on."  "Plan B!  You made a Plan B in case Ariellë died?"  "Of curse... my past employment has taught me to prepare for everything. Watch."  Morrie hurried to one side of the stage, gesturing for Aragon and thePriest to follow him.  They went into a huddle briefly, and then emerged,Aragon looking surprisingly pleased and the Priest looking bewildered.Morrie strode to the font of the stage.  "My good friends, we are sorry to disappoint those of you who came to see Queen Ariellë crowned today.  However, we are sad to announce that this will not be possible, due to technical difficulties."  He raised his voice above the sobbing Pipsqueak.  "However, it is my pleasure to announce that in her place, we are all privileged to be able to watch the crowning of our new monarch... so can I have a big hand please for King Aragon!"  The crowd cheered.  They had come to see a crowning, and weren't overly bothered who got crowned.  The High Priest retrieved the Official Whopping Big Crown, and started again with his Ceremony.  "Friends from.."  "STOP!  Stop the ceremony!"  The crowd emitted a collective gasp, for there, emerging onto the stage, was Frodo!  He was tall and skeleton thin, but the crazed look in his eyes was enough to strike fear into the heart of any grown man (or hobbit).  "You must stop the ceremony! Ariellë was murdered!  She was murdered, assassinated by..."  He began to raise his hand, to point as someone on the stage, but his screams were curtailed as an arrow thudded into his back, and he fell to the ground, silenced.
   'I was only ten feet away when the shot rang out.  Whizz.   Thwock.The crowd began to scream, but I'd been on the business end of a darttoo often to be afraid.  I didn't even bother looking into the wings; Ifigured whoever fired the shot was too smart to hang around.  So Istrolled over to Frodo, lying pinned to the stage by the arrow.  Helooked unconscious, and I gave him a tap to help him stay that way.  Iwasn't worried about that skeletal freak; I'd seen him survive too manywounds to think he was in danger.  So I turned him over on his side,broke off the point protruding from his chest, and pulled the rest ofthe arrow out of his back.   'This was a humdinger and no mistake.  I'd just been admiring thefine job pulled on Ariellë: there aren't too many folks who know how tomanufacture a Bywater Grin, and we'll keep it that way, just sayingthat it involves a thumbtack, half a glass of Old Winyards, choklit, agrain of Vala Dust, and the Secret Ingredient.   'But this was different.  I only had to glance at the arrow to knowwhere it came from: long and straight in the shaft, tapering greenfeathers.  Leaving the ceremonial to Paragraph, the Priest, and Aragon,I hoisted Frodo over a shoulder, slipped off the stage, and went tolook for Lego-lass.   '"I wasn't there!" she insisted.  Her square face was shinier thanever.  "Giggly can testify that I was..."   '"Yeah, yeah," I interrupted.  I'd dumped Frodo at the Houses ofHealing, with strict orders to keep him sedated.  "Any gumshoe can tellyou were framed.  The question is, by who?  Who's had access to yourquiver?"   '"Nobody!" she answered.  "I keep it with me at all times.  I onlytake it off when I go to bed."   '"Anybody with you then?" I asked, rhetorically.   '"Nein!" Giggly said.  "I was nowhere around.  You ask Lego-lass!"   '"Yeah," I said, "but the arrow..."   '"What is this?  You want to blame everything on the Dwerrows?  TheDwerrows are responsible for wars, the stock market, assassinations,nu?  You think we have no feelings?  Hath not a Dwarf eyes?  Hath not aDwarf mustaches?  Hath not a Dwarf ear wax, nostril hair, foot fungus?"   '"Waitaminnit.  I didn't say you did it.  I know you couldn't firean arrow without hitting your own foot. I just want to know if you tookLego-lass's arrow."   'Giggly growled and was silent.   '"Things could get rather difficult for 'Lass..." I reminded him.   '"All right!  I did borrow an arrow.  Boromir said he wanted tolook at one, see how it was made."   'Boromir.  How could I have forgotten about him?  The web grewdeeper.   'I found him in the Tower, watching the late-night newscasts ofPalanTirith.  I laid it on the line for him without fear; I'd comearmed with a big bottle of limpë.   '"Thou hast the wrong man, friend!" he exclaimed.  "Ariellë was mysister.  Wherefore should I harm her?"   '"Leave Ariellë out of it, chump.  It was Frodo who got the hit.And you and Frodo have a history, nespasu?"   '"True enough it is that I hate the bastard and would gladly see himdead," Boromir said with a goofy smile.  "But I did not shoot him.Why should I?  As I know from experience, it is not easy to kill sucha one.  And living, he would endure a hell of self-loathing that is farworse than death.  How could I possibly better that?"   '"That's nothing to me.  All I care about is the arrow."   '"I know nothing of arrows.  Why don't you ask Lego-lass?"   '"You're lying," I said.  "Lie again, and you get this bottle oflimpë in the face.  Then you can see if Aragon will make you a newone!"   'Boromir looked at the open bottle poised in his right hand, andgulped.  You could see the lump travel from his throat all the way downto his right foot.  I hate toons.   '"All right, I confess!" he said.  "I asked Giggly to get me anarrow from Lego-lass.  But I didn't mean to kill Frodo!  I swear!"   '"So what did you mean?"   '"She said she'd let me rub oil on her thighs if I got one from her!I didn't know that she would do anything with it!  I thought it wasjust for her weapons collection!  I promise!"   'There are times when a shamus has to decide how far he wants to getinto a case.  Sometimes, when you follow the leads, you end upsomeplace you don't wanna be.  It doesn't matter how long it's taken orhow much work you've done; sometimes you just drop the matter if youknow what's good for you.  As they say where I come from, you can'tfight Brandy Hall.'   So it was that on the day of Midsummer, Aragon the King El Lessermarried Arwen, Warrior Princess, in the City of Commerce, and the longtale of their difficult and tortuous relationship was come tofulfilment.   There are eight thousand stories in the Magic Kingdom.  This hasbeen one of them.
   When the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companionsconsidered, but soon dismissed, the thought of returning to their ownhomes.  'The Shire?' Morrie asked rhetorically as he lay back on hislawn chair sipping a piña colada and having his feet massaged by twobuxom Mûmakteers.  'Where's that?  Oh, yes, I remember.  Depressedarea.  People live in holes.'   Frodo had recovered from his wound, and with plenty of bedrest, newclothes, and five meals a day was better than ever.  But he seemed tohave no memory of the events of Coronation Day at all.   So Frodo went to Aragon as he was sitting with Arwen by thefountain, and she sang a song of Valhalla, while the Tree grew andblossomed.  They welcomed Frodo and rose to greet him; and Aragon said:   'I know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to take up yourownership of Moneybags Hall in Nurnenshire.  Well, dearest friend, thetree grows best in the land of its sires....' (Frodo frowned at this)'but nonetheless you must do as you please.  Behold!  Here are theparchments giving you the title to Nurnenshire; and here are the keysof the manor.  Just sign here... and here.... and again there.Congratulations, Frodo!  You are now the proud owner of Nurnenshire,with a 51% share in Mordor Enterprises, and the courtesy title of "Dukeof Nurn."'   'Fifty... one... percent!' Frodo gasped.  'But that's a controllingshare!'   'Do you wonder at that, Ring-eater?' said Arwen.  'For you know thatthree-quarters of the land area of Mordor is in Nurnenshire, and 99% ofthe arable land.  But do not forget that the headquarters of MordorEnterprises is ruined, its Board of Directors have been slain, and thevast majority of its records are lost with the fall of the Dark Tower.'   'Whoo-hoo!' cried Frodo, heedless of Arwen's cautions.  'I'm incharge of Mordor!  Heh-heh... now those Orcs'll find out how acorporation ought to be run!   Hm... let's see....'   Frodo stalked up and down the courtyard, shouting to himself as hemilked the Kow.  'First, I'll rebuild the Dark Tower.  No, two of them!They must rise even higher then before, or the narcoterrorists havewon!  Then, I'll stamp out the last remnants of Socialism.  In fiveyears we'll be outperforming Gondor!  Hah-hah!  Nothing, nothing canstop me now!  'Cos I--I'm the Duke of Nu-urn!'   'Dook, Dook, Dook   Dook of Nurn, Dook, Dook   Dook of Nurn, Dook, Dook,   Dook of Nurn, Dook, Dook, Dook...' came the echoing chorus from thesides of Mount Minnie.   Aragon coughed.  'Since you are so (potentially) wealthy,' he said,'then you surely won't mind redeeming this.'  And with that heproduced a much-folded, dog-eared document.  'Your IOU,' he went on,'for I believe fifty thousand gold pieces...'   'Fifty grand!'  Frodo exclaimed.  'You kept that?  Youbloodsucker!  You can't be serious!'   'But I am,' Aragon said, nodding.  'You see, with the downturn inrevenue and unredeemed war expenses, Crown finances are somewhatembarrassed. I must collect my debts where they are owed me, or gopenniless.'   'I'm not going to be supporting him,' Arwen finished.   'Well, I don't have 50 Gs on me.  Maybe when I get to MoneybagsHall...'   'Oh, don't worry about that,' Aragon said.  'Just sign this cheque,and it'll be deducted from the assets of your Estate.'   Frodo snarled, but took the proffered quill and signed.  'That's thelast I see of you, you rascal.  I knew as soon as I set eyes upon youthat you were a rogue!  Well, be seein' ya, toots -- I'm off toNurnenshire!'   Aragon took the cheque, verified the signature, and tucked it awayinside the ample folds of his tunic.  He smiled broadly and nodded atArwen.   'One moment, Ring-eater,' she said softly but menacingly.   Frodo stopped and turned back, warned by her voice. 'What is it?' hegrowled, hand straying to the hilt of his sword.   'I understand that after all the trauma you have suffered yourmemory may be weak.  Therefore I wish to bring to your recollectionthis document, which you signed before you left Rivendell.'  Sheproduced an ornate parchment, covered in tiny elvish script and adornedwith many wax seals attached to ribbons.   'Yeah, okay,' said Frodo.  'I remember that.  That's my deferment.But it was good for 10 years, and I destroyed the Ring in much lessthan that amount of time!'   'That is true indeed,' said Arwen.  'Howbeit, I draw your attentionto the last paragraph.  No, the one under the seals.'   Frodo looked.  Besides being half-hidden by the enormous seals, theelvish script was composed of letters about a millimeter and a halfhigh, on average.  He held the parchment close to his eyes, squintedthe right, and read out loud:   'I, Frodo Baggins of Bag End, being of doubtful sanity and unable tocare for myself, do remit to El Rond, Lord of Rivendell, the solecustody and guardianship of any and all Estates that I may lawfullyinherit or otherwise come to possess within the boundaries of the Landof Mordor.  I grant to El Rond, Lord of Rivendell, sole power to actupon my behalf, to buy, sell, grant, deed, enjoy, transmit, bestow,bequeath, or otherwise dispose of said Estates in precisely such manneras if I were a legally declared minor or lunatic.  Signed, FRODOBAGGINS.'   The last words were uttered in a semi-incoherent rush as Frodofoamed extravagantly at the mouth and then collapsed senseless on thecobblestones of the Court of the Fountain.  What a loser, came amocking voice inside his head as he lost consciousness.  I always knewyou wouldn't amount to anything.   The next day, Frodo, Sam, Morrie and Pipsqueak were informed thatthey were several months in arrears on their rents and would forthwithbe expelled from the City.
   When the day of departure came, the four hobbits succeeded inattaching themselves to the tail end of the orda of Rohirrim who hadcome down from the Riddlemark to bear HeyHoDen back to his ancestralkingdom.  King Eonerd and Eowynn verified the dead King's identity inthe morgue, and then shut the zippered black bag as fast as they could.It was a sultry southern summer, and HeyHoDen had been stored up forover three months.   They placed the bag with HeyHoDen's body inside a plastic barrel,which went inside a corrugated metal tube, which was sealed withcement, which was locked inside a packing crate, which was put in thetrailer of a sixteen-wheeler headed north.  The trucker drove slowly,pausing at rest stops every quarter-day to allow the tümän of Ridersto catch up.  The four hobbits hitched a ride in the back of the cab.   In that riding went also Aragon and Arwen and others of the weddingguests: El Rond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, Boromir and Imrahil and, infact,the entire invitation list, all of whom had noticed how muchslimmer their wallets became the longer they stayed in Minas Tirith.   At a leisurely pace they rode the highway north through Anórien, andthey came to injun territory.  The injuni warriors, stoked to afrenzy by the secret herbs they habitually took before entering battle,fired many arrows among them, but hit no one.  Aragon read aloud aproclamation annexing six-sevenths of injun territory to Gondorin return for the right to erect a casino and have exclusive huntingand fishing rights on the remaining one-seventh.  The procession thenrolled on, leaving a few score of anti-hunting and anti-gamblingprotestors demonstrating behind them.   After many days of journey, the truck bearing HeyHoDen came at lastto Edoras City.  The dandelions grew tall and stately about Medusald.There a great feast was held for the visitors; and if the occasionalDunlending slave fell into the immense fires and was accidentallycooked together with the ceremonial horseflesh, no one commented uponit.   Then they buried HeyHoDen, still sealed with cement, fifty feet deepbeneath a mound planted thick with garlic, topped with ancient symbolsof power, and under the permanent guard of the Riddlemark's finestwarriors armed with silver-tipped spears.  With him were buried allthose things and people which he had had close to him in life, lest hereturn to claim them.  The Edoras Choir slowly sang a song of exorcism,which Gléoclubb the minstrel made, and immediately died after.  Eventhose who comprehended not the harsh gutturals of the Edorian tonguecould tell how horrible the song was, as it described the reddenedlight of the moon shining through the blood-drenched fields of theLammas Ichor, the gorecrows slaking their thirst in the red pools, thehowling of the wolves as their brethren crunched upon bones, and howKing HeyHoDen arose and with dripping corpse-fingers sought to destroythose who were close to him in life:   Out of dark, out of death, to the dead's rising   He clambered out of the clay still clinging   To his bloody fingers, with filth blackened   That sought the throats of thrall and servant,   Or of sister-son his throne usurping...   But Morrie wondered at the superstitions of the Riders, ponderinghow they might be turned to his own advantage.   When the burial was over and the stone atop the mound was inscribedwith the words "HeyHoDen, and his worm Grimey", another minstrel (therewere many minstrels and to spare in the Riddlemark of those days, andtheir lives were held cheap) named all the Lords of the Mark in theirordure: Yorl the Kid, who had purchased Edoras in the days ofGondor's indebtedness, and Prego mixer of the Sauce, and Polderdrainer of the Fens, brother of Molder the Dead; and Freewine theGenerous, and Goldwyn the Mogul, and Dior the Couturier, and Gram theWeighty, and Helm the Hard-headed, and Deem the Jazzmaster, who hadheld concerts in Deem's Help that had rivalled those of Caer Andrews.So ended the nine mounds on the west, because there had been a violentrevolution in those days which installed a new dynasty, and after camethe mounds of the east-side: Freelove the Revolutionary; and Fluffy,who due to lack of ceremonial propriety (the minstrels had been unableto keep a straight face when speaking his name) had returned as adraugr and had eaten half the warriors in Medusald before beingexorcised; and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and Fengel, and Thengel,and HeyHoDen the latest.  And by the time HeyHoDen was named, Eonerdand all the Riders were very drunk.   When the feast drew to an end (at about four in the morning, withthe sun due to rise soon), Eonerd tried to arise and said in a slurredvoice: 'HeyHoDen's dead.  That means I'm the king.  Cool, huh?'   A nervous titter arose from those of the guests who were not alreadyasleep or dead drunk.   'But I got good news for ya,' he continued.  'Eewww....inifred mysis had the hots for Aragon.  But he's already married, the bastard.And 'sides he's her father.  Life sucks, dunnit?'   More nervous laughter.   'So instead she's gonna marry the nummer two guy.  Wossis name.Farrie... Farrah... uh... Bore-oh-meer, Steuart of Gonnor©!'   Muted cheers.  Eonerd propped himself up, knuckles on the table, andlooked around to see if anyone would respond.  Aragon came awake with astart after a swift kick from Arwen, and removed a paper from his tux.   'Thus,' he read slowly and with a wince, 'is the friendship of theMark and of Gondor bound with a new bond.  No niggard are you,Eonerd, to give...'   'What?' Eonerd interrupted.  'Whadjou say?'   Aragon coughed and began again.  'No niggard are you, Eonerd...'   'Thass what I thought you said.  Well I don'know whuss like inGonnor.  But here in Ed'ras we don' allow filthy lang-idge like that inthe hall!'   'All I said,' said Aragon, 'was "No niggard..."'   'Thass enough!  Outta the hall, now!  We'll settle this innacourtchard!'  Eonerd reached with one hand for his sword-belt, lost hisbalance, and fell face forward onto the table.  Aragon and Arwen leftswiftly, and departed without taking leave of King Eonerd.   The hobbits had remained hidden during this time, but before theprocession was ready to roll Morrie paid a last visit to Eonerd andEowynn.  And Eonerd said, 'Kings of old would have laden you with giftsthat a tractor-trailer could not bear for your deeds upon the Cowboy'sField; but those were the Kings of Old, and these are cheaper times.Nonetheless, my sister wants you to have this, in memory of the hornsof the Mark at sunrise.'  And Morrie wondered what Eonerd was talkingabout, but he kept his mouth shut.   Then Eowynn gave to Morrie a small tin horn, wrought with a rubbersphere at one end.  'This is an heirloom of our house,' said Eowynn.'When you squeeze the globe, the horn will make a noise.  Behold!' andshe pressed the rubber sphere with her white fingers.  Honk went thehorn.  Honk, honk.
   Lego-lass and Giggly were to continue on to the Giggling Caves atDeem's Help, to start their long-planned amusement park.  Aragon andArwen, who had an interest in all new enterprises in the region, camealong, as did El Rond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, as they were planning toreturn to their homes by this route.    When Lego-lass emerged from theGiggling Caves she was laughing her rear end off, and immediatelyfronted Giggly the money to begin the project, and the two at oncetelegraphed Minas Tirith to round up investors.   Leaving Lego-lass and Giggly behind, the others rode from Deem'sHelp to Isengard, expecting to meet the Ments there and behold Isengardtransformed into an electric paradise.  But all the land around was dimand quiet as they approached.  Eagles circled ominously overhead.Cardinals and waxwings in the nearby bushes eyed them disturbingly.   At Isengard they saw that the stone circle had been destroyed.Where it had been was a wilderness of trees and bushes, full of deer,bears, wolves, panthers, oliphaunts, sloths, tigers, langurs andmacaques, not to mention birds of all shapes and sizes.  Withtrepidation the travellers rode to the center of the old circle.  Thehobbits, as usual, sneaked along behind.  The hideous shape of Eyesorestill stood there, its shadow sadly reflected in the water of a poolsurrounding it.   As they stood, aghast at the transformation of Isengard fromsomething that might have been economically productive into some kindof biologically diverse eco-park, they heard a series of squawks andwhistles coming from nearby.  They turned, and slowly became aware of afigure sitting very still, cross-legged, in the shade of a pine tree.   It was clad in a simple robe of hempen brown, and its thin hair andscanty beard were of brown streaked with grey.  A yellow-breasted chatstood on one thigh and ate berries from an upturned hand.  The mansmiled, looking well-pleased and amused.   A sudden light broke on Frodo.  'Radagast!' he cried, forgettingthat he was supposed to be sneaking.   Radagast laughed.  'So you have heard the name, have you?  All theWoodmen used to call me that in Rhosgobel, I believe.  A sign ofaffection, possibly.  But evidently you did not expect to see me here.'   'I did not,' Frodo said.  'But I might have guessed.  The crows, theeagles...'   'Exactly,' Radagast answered.  'You have been watched, all the wayfrom Rivendell.  And now, with Aruman and Gandalf out of the way, withMorenaughtie and Rumpustum in the distant East, with the Balrogdestroyed and Sauron reduced to impotence, I am the most powerful ofthe Maiar left in the West.  And I have... hm... plans.'   'You traitor!' cried Aragon.  'What have you done with my Ments?'   'I sent them home,' Radagast said happily.  'To rust, I hope.  Theirwork is done.  Trees and orchards are coming back here, King of Gondor,where birds may sit and sing and beasts may dig their holes.  In time,Rohan and Gondor both may become fit habitations for the animals thatshall inherit them.  Even in Lothlórien, perhaps, the golf coursesshall grow over with crabgrass, to become the abode of moles andchipmunks!'   Aragorn gritted his teeth.  'You can't do this,' he said slowly.'You're eating into my profit margin.  How many people do you think aregoing to come out to see this...' -- he gestured around him -- 'thiswilderness?'   'Middle-earth was a wilderness once, before Men got their hands onit,' Radagast said.  'One day it shall be a wilderness again.  What yousee is merely the first-fruits.  Go back to your kingdom, King ofGondor; keep it as you may.  But know that the beasts and birds arereturning.  They will reclaim their own.'  He resumed his silentsitting, and the chat began to whistle again.   Aragon turned on the hobbits, whom he now saw for the first time.'This is your doing, isn't it!  You fiends!  You have come all this wayjust to see me, the King of Gondor, humiliated!'   Frodo shook his head, confused.  A voice inside his head seemed tobe saying squeeze him while you can, precious!, but he did notunderstand it.  Sam grinned.  Pipsqueak stared at the spaces betweenhis toes while Morrie whistled nonchalantly.   Arwen came up behind Aragon.  'This is not the hobbits' doing,' shesaid softly.  'They knew no more of Radagast than we, nor do his plansfit with theirs.  Yet I wonder what brings them so far, following onour very heels?'   Frodo looked at Sam, helplessly.  Sam looked at Paragraph.Pipsqueak nudged Morrie, who looked back at Arwen defiantly.   'I was hoping to get a word with you privately,' he said.  'Butthis'll have to do.'   'A word?' said Arwen.  'About what?'  Her voice was soft butmenacing, as it not infrequently was.   'About your part in the murder of Ariellë Húriniel, and theattempted murder of Frodo Baggins.'   Aragon, Sam and Pipsqueak gasped.  The Elves chuckled sarcastically.   'Murder, Mr. Brandybuck?  That's a hard charge to make against theQueen of Gondor.  What evidence do you have?'   'Enough.  I know that you enticed Boromir into convincing Gigglyinto stealing an arrow from Lego-lass's quiver, which you then coulduse to shoot Frodo to keep him quiet, while putting the blame onLego-lass.'   'Hah!' Arwen laughed.  'You are very clever, Mr. Brandybuck.  Tooclever, some might say.  Yes, you are right, Mr. Brandybuck.  I didshoot Frodo, not to kill him, but to keep him from blurting out thename of Ariellë's murderer before the people of the City.'   'Your name.'   'No, not my name, Mr. Brandybuck.  The name of the killer.  The oneperson who had the most to gain from the murder.  But no court can nowprosecute the murderer; for he now is the law, and the ultimatejudge: Aragon son of Arathon, King El Lesser.'   Everyone turned to look at Aragon.  He stared back at them, mouthgaping wide open.   'No,' he gasped after a long silence.  'Not me!  Ididn't do it!  I didn't really want to be king, not like that!'   Morrie looked in Aragon's face for a long time.  Then he shook hishead and turned back to Arwen.  'Nope, lady,' he said, 'you've got thewrong guy.   It takes a smart cookie to cook up a Bywater Grin, andfrankly, your husband's just a few holes short of a smial, if you knowwhat I mean.'   'But it had to have been!  I mean, who else...'   'Who indeed,' said Morrie, looking around him meaningfully.  'Whoindeed.'   Idiot, said the voice in Frodo's head.   Radagast had arisen during the conversation and stood just outsidethe circle of recrimination, leaning on a smoothed pinewood staff.  Hechuckled softly.  'Well, King of Gondor,' he said, 'perhaps you oughtto return to your own land now. If your own Queen thinks you guilty ofmurdering your predecessor, there may be others with the same thought.And while there is no legal way to punish a king, there are manyillegal ways to remove one. There are those who would not be unhappywith a change.  Some, I guess, who are unhappy with the recent peacewith Mordor, perhaps?'   Aragon and Arwen looked at each other in terror, rushed to theirhorses, and galloped off southward without a word of farewell.   'Well now,' said Radagast, considering the elves and hobbits beforehim.  'You were travelling on to Rivendell, were you not?  Excellent.I think I shall go with you. It will give me an opportunity to stretchmy legs, and give more attention to the northlands, where my effortsare perhaps especially needed.'   'But... but... ' said Pipsqueak.   'What about the weed trade?' exclaimed Morrie.   'What about the Revolution?' expostulated Sam.   'Cassiopeia!' screamed Frodo, apropos of nothing.   'We're not gonna take this,' said Morrie.   'Oh, no, we ain't gonna take it,' rumbled Sam.   At that moment an immense black bear, six feet tall at the shoulder,ambled out from behind a rhododendron and looked at them.  Its six-inchclaws clacked upon the rocks, and its tongue licked brutally longcanines.   'Rest assured, my young friends,' said Radagast, stroking the bear'sfur, 'that all shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner ofthing shall be well.'  And they believed him.  He was a Maia, afterall.
   They travelled westward, the Elves riding on their horses, thehobbits on various species of wild deer that Radagast had summoned(Frodo rode an especially majestic elk with an antler-span of tenfeet).  Radagast himself rode bear-back.   They passed by the Gap in Rohan.  Radagast had a word with themanager, and within a week they were selling clothing made from hemp,organically-grown cotton, and recycled fibres, while a detachment ofwell-drilled mandrills provided security.   They rode through the Gap into the slums of Dunland.  There theyfound endless chain-link fences, hills of burning tires, vast pavementsof cracked asphalt, collapsing brick tenements, and shantytowns roofedin corrugated iron.  The Dunlendings who loitered on the street-cornersmocked them, calling them fairies--; but Radagast had only togesture, and waves of green kudzu covered the trash-heaps andtenements, and the Dunlendings fled, racked by allergies.   Six days after leaving Isengard they journeyed through theliquor-retailing zone of Dunland.  At 6, as the lights began to comeon, they overtook a lady with a superfluity of legs, dashingly clad inred and black.  At her heels slouched a semi-naked man in blackleather, leashed to her by a spiked dog-collar and gazing morosely atthe ground.   'Well Shelob!' said Radagast.  'Where are you going?'   'Vhot isz zet beink to you?' she answered.  'Vosz you lookink for avogah, or voot you rezser hef a date visz Sztinky?'   'You know the answers,' Radagast said.  'No and no.  But in any caseyour monopoly on wogah is over.  The King controls the red-lightdistrict in Disgiliath now.  But if you had waited in Mordor, you wouldhave seen him, and he might have shown more interest in your offer.'   'Zen all ze more reason to hef left sooner,'  said Shelob, 'for I amnot desirink him.  Indeed, if you are vishink for en enswer to yourfirst qvestion, I vosz lookink for a ravine in ze mountainsz in vhichto be spinnink my veps.'   'Then you are going the wrong way.  I know a forest where you mightfeel right at home, though.  Would you like my help?'   'You helpink me?' said Shelob.  'Surely you isz jestink me.  Isink zosz vilt-lants isz not beink so goot for ze nightclups, yes?  Youhaf gecome to be laughink at Shelop in her vonderinks, visz no clup, nostaich, no Grisettes...' and she began to weep copious tears.   'There, there,' said Radagast, patting her kindly on the shoulder.   'Who is this wench?' said Paragraph.   'And why haven't we been introduced yet?' said Moribund.   'It's Shelob, the decadent and depraved whoremistress ofDisgiliath!' ranted Sam.   'Oh, indeed,' said Morrie.  'Perhaps you should have told us moreabout your, er, adventures there.  What's she do?'   'Vhot dosz Shelop doink?' hissed the madam.  'How isz my famegefallen!  Alas, zet I kennot show you vhot I coot be doink in ze dayszof my glory!'  And she wept again.  Then, suddenly tearless, sheclapped her forelegs.  'Sztinky!' she ordered.  'Be showink zeesz finegentlesz vhot it is ve isz doink.  I em trop fatigué to indulchmyself.'  She flicked him the man behind her with a whip she held inher front claw.  He shuddered, but did not move or turn his face fromthe ground.   'Poor Sztinky!' Shelob whispered confidentially to the travellers.'Hisz tower isz gefallen down, end now he kennot to erect it again.Get up!' she shouted at the slouching man, yanking on his leash.  'Dozet number from South Tampalas.'   The man staggered up and faced his audience.  There were darkcircles beneath his reddened eyes, white streaks of dry salt on hisface, and a brown encrustation at one corner of his mouth.  Hiscodpiece was decorated with the Lidless Eye.  He began to sing, morethan passably, but without emotion:   Bloodthirsty Shelob is the      lob I love   Bloodthirsty Shelob is the      lob I love   Bloodthirsty Shelob is the      lob I love   Now ain't that too damn bad!   Her kiss is like trinitro-      toluene   Her kiss is like trinitro-      toluene   Her kiss is like trinitro-      toluene   Now ain't that too damn bad!   Bloodthirsty Shelob's suckin'      Uruk blood   She is always suckin'      Uruk blood   Bloodthirsty Shelob's suckin'      Uruk blood   An' she don't use Aqua-fresh!   Shelob laughed, clapped and blew kisses at the audience.  They didnot applaud.  The sight of Shelob's slave, wretched and degraded beyondimagination, stirred even Morrie with, if not pity, then at least anutter revulsion that afforded no amusement.   Shelob's face turned sour.  'Be goink!' she said.  'You hef doomtyourselfs, end you isz knowink it.  It vill be comfortink me in myvonderinks to sink zet you hef geburnt down your own house vhen you hefdestroyt Sztinky'sz.'   Shelob yanked on her slave's leash, and he crouched down on allfours.  She turned back the way they had come, and he followed.  But ashe passed them, he whimpered 'Poor old Stinky!  Poor old Stinky!Always beaten, never a wogah.  How I hate her!  How I wish I couldleave her!'   'Then leave her!' said Radagast.   But "Stinky" only glanced with one red eye full of terror atRadagast, and then shuffled quickly past behind Shelob.  At length thepair came to the hobbits, and Shelob stopped and stared at them; butthey looked at her with indifference.   'So you isz gloatink over Shelob too, my ducks?' she said.  'Noteven a little kiss for her?' and she turned a heavily rouged cheektoward them.  No one stepped forward.  Shelob sighed.  'I hef only vonvord of advice for you, chickies.  Bevare ze Roglinks!  Zet isz all.Au revoir, mes petits amis.  Au revoir!'  and she and Stinkyvanished down the path.   Lovely limbs, eh, sonny boy? said the voice in Frodo's mind.Frodo slumped over and had the dry heaves.
   The next day they rode through suburban Dunland, where no men nowdwelt, though it was a green and pleasant neighborhood, due toskyrocketing property taxes.  Radagast now rode some way ahead,murmuring to himself, scattered phrases in which the word 'Rogling'could often be heard.   'What's a Rogling, and why did Shelob warn us against them?'Pipsqueak asked Frodo after a while.   'I don't know,' Frodo answered.  'I have trouble thinking thesedays.  Tell me, Pip, did you ever... I don't know... think you heard,well, someone talking, like a voice, only there was no one there?'   'Oh, yes, quite a lot,' Pipsqueak responded brightly.  He was havinga good day.   'And, um... did this voice ever, well, criticize you or tell youwhat to do?'   'Oh, all the time.'   'And... did your voice have a name?'   'Sure!  It was Aruman, chief of the wizards.  He came back from thedead to warn me against Gandalf.'   'Do you still hear him?'   'Nah.  He went away after Gandalf died.  I guess he was finishedwith me.'   'Well, Pip... you're not going to believe this... but I'm hearing avoice, too.'   'No!'  Pipsqueak was visibly and sincerely flabbergasted with utteramazement.  Even on a good day, he had his limits.   'I think it's trying to tell me something... but I don't know what.And I think... I think I know who it is, but I daren't believe it...'   'Who?' asked Pipsqueak excitedly.   'Bilbo.  It sounds like Bilbo.  But it can't be, can it?  Bilbo'snot dead.'   'I dunno.  Why don't you ask El Rond?'   So Frodo rode ahead after El Rond's party, who in typical elvishfashion had ridden along with the hobbits while having absolutelynothing to do with them.  It took Frodo quite some time to get El Rondto notice him.  Had he still been only three feet tall, he never wouldhave managed it; but he finally succeeded in physically squeezingbetween El Rond and Al Ladan, with whom El Rond was conversing.   'I hate mortals,' El Rond was saying.  'I can't stand them anylonger. It's the smell. I feel saturated by it. I can taste theirstink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been... infectedby it.  I must get out of here.  I must get free.   Oh, it's you,Mister Baggins.'   'El Rond,' Frodo said, 'do you know what happened to my fa... toBilbo?  He's safe at Rivendell, isn't he?'   El Rond made a dismissive shrug.  'And this concerns me how...Mister Baggins?'   'Well, I'm afraid... I think something terrible may have happened tohim, Sir.'   El Rond sighed and looked angry.  'What happens to Mr. Bilbo Bagginsis none of my concern.  I am in no way... responsible for his welfare.'   'But... was he safe, was he all right the last you saw him.'   El Rond rolled his eyes backward in their sockets.  'Yes,' he saidat last.  'He was thinking of you, if you must know.'  Frodo breathed asigh of relief.  'Actually I think he left you a note, though none ofus could read it.  Do we have it, Al Rokar?'  Al Rokar produced anenvelope from his saddle-bags and handed it to El Rond, who passed itto Frodo, taking good care to avoid touching his fingers.   Frodo fell back and opened the envelope.  It was indeed in Bilbo'sinimitably illegible script, and it took him several minutes before hecould puzzle part of it out; but intercepting Bilbo's letters to his"nieces" and reading them had been one of his favorite childhoodamusements.   "El Rond you bas...d", it read, "Why didn't you include me in theCompany?  I'm going whether you like it or not.  Frodo can't be trustedwith the Ring.  He'll spoil Gandalf's plan for sure.  So what ifthey're days ahead.  I'll just follow A...n's cute ..s.  I'll get thatRing back, sure as my name's Don Gi..anni!  BB."   Frodo felt ill, but that was nothing new.  Then all of a sudden thevoice came back into his mind, louder and clearer than ever before.How dare you read my mail, boy! followed by It's ours, precious,and we wants it!  Frodo suddenly found that, without noticing it, hehad folded the letter and put in inside his waistcoat-pocket.   At last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly to thebrink of the deep valley of Rivendell, and saw emanating from the clefta red light shining, lighting the whole valley like a dark flame.   Radagast caught his breath.  At the descent into the valley therehad stood for many years a tall birch tree.  But though it was onlySeptember, it seemed to stand leafless, and yet glowed with a ruddylight.  As they drew nearer to the tree, they saw that from the end ofevery twig there seemed to leap a tiny flickering flame, barely an inchtall; and within each flame moved an almost microscopic black creature.   Radagast reached up into the branches, and scooped one off onto hispalm.  It burned there for a few moments, then crawled to the tip ofhis outstretched index finger, spread minute diaphanous wings like amayfly's, and flew back into the tree.   'It is as I feared,' said Radagast.  'The 'Rogs have hatched west ofthe mountains.'   'I remember who murdered Ariellë,' Frodo mumbled in return.
  Not wanting to deal with Roglings, the hobbits and Radagast spent ratherlittle time in Rivendell before going on.  Even Margarita could not getthem to enjoy their stay; El Rond was about to vote the conscription andall those present would have to go on a Rogling hunt, which is ratherunpleasant when you are not trained in the art, as you all know.  Theywere all rather sad that they could not get their hands on Bilbo, though;after all he was responsible for all the misery they had gone through. He decided to get rid of the Ring and give it to Frodo.  The Hobbits were not to eager to see the Shire again, except forMorrie.  Frodo was thinking of all his creditors that he had thought he'dnever see again. Sam was trying to find a plausible explanation to giveRosie; he had been gone for over a year just about when he was going tolead the revolution. Morrie was actually thinking of how he couldtighten his hold over the underground and expand his markets - he hadmanaged to get a weak king on the throne, after all.  And Pipsqueak, well,he didn't have a character that was too developed around the beginning ofthe e-text, so he was just worried that he'd lose all the depth he hadacquired.  As they walked, Radagast turned to Frodo and asked him if hewas unwell. He was, after all, supposed to feel his old wounds aroundthis time of the strory.    "Not really," replied Frodo. "I know that I am wounded with knife, stingand tooth, and claws, and falls, and disillusionment, but it's not that bad.Everything will heal I expect."  "How about when you said you remembered who killed Ariellë?" askedRadagast.  "Oh, yes, it's fairly obvious who ordered the kill and I'm suprised thatnone of the other Hobbits realised it."  "How do you mean?"  "Just look at the way in which Ariellë was killed," replied Frodo.  "TheBywater Grin was done perfectly, and the Beltbuckleland Crime Syndicatehas never revealed the trick to anyone.  So it logically falls that thecrime was perpetrated by a Hobbit.  To my certain knowledge, there wereonly four Hobbits present.  Out of those four, only one could know howto do the Grin."  "Why didn't you tell anyone before?"  "The voices told me not to.  They told me that it would cause mayhem. Since the voices are also the ones who explained to me what I justexplained to you, I believed them."  "So why are you telling me now?  I don't understand you."  "The voices told me that once we had passed the Forsaken Inn and werefinally nearing Bree, noone would care anymore, and I could tell ifanyone asked."  "I see," said Radagast, and after a paused added, "I'll have to ponderwhat you have told me."  As they neared Bree, they came to a halt.  They wanted to get news ofwhat had happened since they left, but they didn't want to go into town,remembering the huge bill that the Nazdaq had raised for them atBarliman Butterball's inn.  It was finally elected that Frodo, now beingbeyond recognition, would go accompanied by Radagast, whom noone knewaround these parts.  Why they trusted him, they couldn't've told, butthey did, probably because he hadn't tried to ask them for a fee foranything yet.  As they entered the town, Frodo knew that something had gone horriblywrong.  All the aluminum sidings had been replaced by compositematerials, and there had been no guard at the gate. Insted, an ATM stoodthere, an Automated Talking Machine, which told them that they had topay ten flokarinos each in order to have access to the town.  They thenproceeded to the Prancing Pony, expectng to gather news in the commonroom, which to their utter amazement was empty.  They asked Barlimanabout this.  "'Tis because of the new college which has opened in the Shire.  'Tisa bunch of Big'Uns that came from the South, they started by buying outmost of the industries in the area, including our siding industry,which they have defiled.  Then they somehow managed to overthrown allstock markets and have all our banks go bankrupt.  They then opened up acollege in the Shire and started new banks, so that they would get allthe profits.  'Tis an evil day to be in these parts."  Hearing this Frodo had a secret smile, being very happy indeed; thismeant that his credit history has most likely been erased entirely!  Buthidding his enthusiasm, Frodo asked for a room for two for the night,and for a good pouch of Eastfarthing weed.  "Ah, but had you asked for anything else, good masters," saidButterball.  "We are now stuck with our own since there in none to behad from the Shire.  All we have is Easthanging, which cannot becompared to Eastfarthings."  Then then talked a bit of what had happenedin the south, being careful not to reveal their true identities, Frodo,in a flash of genius had decided to go as Mr Overhill.  They talkedabout the return of the king, and that he would most likely come thisway eventually.  Reassured Butterball that he would not raze his innfor past offenses, and that he would most likely elect residence wherethe halls of the king has been in the north, a place called Fu****gNorth.  Legend has it that the place got his name when a king, which oneis now forgotten, was stuck inside his castle because of a snow stormand expressed himself with the epitath which is now the name of theplace.  With that, they all went to bed.  The next morning, Radagast and Frodo took their leave of this ghastlyplace and went to rejoin their companions, since they can't really becalled friends, and told them all that they had learned.  Sam was aboutto ask a question about the revolution, when he was cut off by Morrie:  "So my industry is faltering, but I have new markets that I haveguaranteed myself, what with this slow witted king.  I could even makeup a spece for you if you're interested, Frodo, on the condition that youforget what those voices of yours told you.  I would eventually win incourt, but it would be rather bothersome, and it's not quite true.  I'dhave to let the truth be known if you did try to frame me."  So they kept on walking in silence towards the Shire.  When they passedby the forest in which Tom Bombadil resides, they tried to hurry past it,but Radagast stopped them.  He said that this is where he would leavethem.  He was worried about those voices Frodo was hearing, so he wantedto have a good talk with Bombadil, a talk like he hadn't had in many ayears.  He also wanted to know if Bombadil still had his copy of the DSMIV lying around somewhere; he had lost his since their psychiatryclasses.  So they trudged along, each lost in their own thoughts once again: Frodo quite happy that his debt seemed to be cleared, Morrie wonderinghow he could regain and expand his underground empire (remember thatHobbits live in holes...), and Sam angry that since the author couldn'timitate his dialect elected not to have him talk for the whole chapter. Let's not forget Pipsqueak, he realised that he was losing all the depthof character he had acquired during their adventures.
     Not more than a mile had passed when Pipsqueak, still musing overthe dull future which awaited him, wrinkled his nose.     "What's up, Pipsqueak?" laughed Frodo. "Trying a new facial expression? Think that'll help?" And he and Morrie laughed, though Sam just looked at Frodo's bare throat menacingly and did not join in.     "No," Pipsqueak replied, "I smell smoke."     And sure enough, as the wind slowly changed they all noticed it: a faint whiff of burning, coming from somewhere within the Old Forest. Apart from a slight darkening of the sky to their right, however, they could see nothing amiss; though Pipsqueak thought he could see, for the briefest moment, a small glowing creature like a flying coal flitting dangerously behind the first layer of trees.     Darkness was descending as the four hobbits, nearing the old Bucklebelt Bridge, began to notice the red glow from the depths of the Forest and hear the crackle and roaring. The smoke was now growing acrid in their nostrils. "Still forest, and it comes right up to both sides of the road," Morrie observed grimly. "And we've still got two miles to go!"     "Burn baby burn," Sam muttered under his breath.     "If we hurry," Pipsqueak gasped, "we could try leaving the path and making directly for the River. We might get there ahead of the flames, and jump in."     "No! I'm not gonna ruin my new shoes!" Frodo hollered.     "No chance," Morrie observed, ignoring Frodo as usual. "Wind's freshening. Flames are moving faster. We'd better just run like hell and hope the flames don't burn the whole Shire to the ground."     With that Morrie threw his pack to the ground and began running, and Frodo and Pipsqueak did likewise. Only Sam, long used to carrying the heavy burdens of his employers, kept his provisions with him as he ran.     The flames were soon visible. Fire began encroaching upon the Road as they ran, choking and scared, toward the Bridge. They managed to stay ahead of the blaze in spite of the wind, but as they rounded the final bend Morrie swore in amazement.     "A gate!" he yelled. "They've put up an Erudamned gate!"     And no ordinary gate blocked their way. Made of plate iron and solid steel, it stretched across the Road and was anchored to two great walls of brick which blocked all access to the River in both directions. Fully twelve feet high it loomed, and was surmounted by a series of nasty eight-inch spikes and a thick generous topping of razor wire. Morrie quickly checked the impregnable lock, then he threw the huge doormat (inexplicably marked Keep The Shire Clean!) aside to dig his way under the door, only to find that the roadway under the gate had been resurfaced with huge slabs of freshly-quarried granite. "What the hell is this?" he shouted at the world in general.     "Hey! Hey! Open the gate!" Pipsqueak shouted, banging his fists on the metal.     The wind carried a huge blast of heat towards the hobbits, and an ancient oak crashed across the roadway some fifteen feet behind them, all its branches raging with flame. The travellers sputtered in the sparks and heat, and watched in horror as the dry grass ignited on both sides of the road. Above the hiss and crackling a voice could be heard through the gate. "Shire's closed," the voice said easily. "Visiting hours are between eight and five. Try us again tomorrow."     Morrie and Frodo joined Pipsqueak at the door, pounding their fists on the metal. "Let us in! Let us in!" they shouted. "There's fire out here! We'll burn!"     "The Chief said that sort o' thing was likely t' happen," the voice replied easily.     "Open the gate or we'll die!" Pipsqueak yelled.     The flames approached closer. The iron plating of the door began to heat. For a moment the sweltering hobbits heard no reply save the blaze. Finally the voice answered. "Should've thought o' that beforehand," it said, almost nonchalantly. "Now mind you, in the Shire things is different. We've made preparations. Set matters to hand beforehand, you might say. And if you die, well, that's tragic, I suppose, but if you'd prepared yourselves a bit like we did you might not be in such a fix now. Maybe next time 'round you'll be luckier. Have a nice day."     The hobbits looked at each other in breathless panic, then redoubled their pounding on the iron gate. Pipsqueak's fists were starting to get burned by the heating metal. "Let us in! Let us in!" they cried, choking and sweating in the heat.     "Nope," the voice finished. "No visitors at night. Go away."     "But we aren't visitors," Frodo gasped. "We live here!"     "You what?" the voice said suddenly. "You live here? Did ye sign out? D'ye have a travel pass?"     In the thickening smoke Sam drew upon some hidden reserve, and a memory of the voice. "Look here, Hobbie Haywain," he shouted. "If you don't let us in right this minute ye'll find my fist'll be giving ye some o' that dental work ye so desperately need!"     "Bless me!" the voice replied, and from deep within the gate there came a long series of metallic thung noises. Half of the great gate began to creak, and the four hobbits threw their weight against the now-searing metal. They cried and gasped with effort but the door refused to move until they noticed the gate opened outwards and tried pulling on it instead.     "Get in here! Get in here!" Hobbie yelled, and as the four hobbits stumbled through the opening he grasped the door with his great oven-mitts (garishly embroidered Property Of The Shire), swung it shut, and relatched the twenty-three mighty latches. As he set the last latch he turned around, and was astonished to find the four hobbits had already begun to run towards Hobbiton. "Hey, there, wait!" he shouted. "Ho! Wait! Ye're breakin' Rule Twelve!"     After a short distance the hobbits ran behind a short brick building and stopped, gasping.     "What the hell was old Hobbie on about?" Sam choked, wiping the soot from his eyes.     "Who knows," Morrie coughed, spitting some ash out of his throat. "He's never exactly been the smartest bread in the sandwich."     "Well, at least he stopped chasing us," Pipsqueak wheezed. "Good thing. The concrete was really beginning to hurt my feet."     With a sudden horrible realization the four hobbits stopped and looked at the ground. The area surrounding the small building was paved with concrete. They looked out towards the road into town and saw lines of neat, ordered cobblestones. "Where's all the peat moss?" Frodo said in astonishment. "What happened to the bark paths? The mud-and-dirt roads? The fast-food wrappers?"     "This is unnatural," Sam had to agree.     Night had begun, yet the red glow of the burning Forest could be seen clearly over the Wall. By that glow the hobbits could see their sometimes-beloved, sometimes-despised Shire had changed. Ugly buildings of stone and mortar stood in rows where they remembered seeing ugly buildings of mud and thatch before. Wastebaskets and the occasional spitoon stood in ordered pairs beside the paving of the roadways. Their sticky dirty little Shire had become a place of harsh right angles. "Something horrible is happening here," Frodo whispered. "This place is all sculleyed and muldered. It's making my head hurt."     "Mine too," agreed Morrie. "But right now we need to get under cover. We'll wait till tomorrow to wreak unholy revenge."     They snuck towards an ugly new brick building with a very un-Shire-like slate roof, jimmied the door and slunk within. Inside they found only some wrought-iron patio furniture and a huge store of canned foods. They selected some cans of corned beef and Eastfarthing Canned Broccoli, but realizing they had no can openers they were forced to hack at the cans with their swords. Then Pipsqueak noticed there was no cook-pot, no firewood and indeed no hearth. After six unsuccessful attempts to set fire to Frodo the hobbits sat down in the dark, and cheerlessly ate cold corned beef before lying down for an uncomfortable sleep.     At dawn they were awakened by a furious pounding at the door. "Open up, in the name of the Chief!" came the cry from outside. "You're all under arrest!"     "No!" Frodo screamed back angrily. "I'm under a duvet!"     Morrie rose swiftly and kicked open the door, confronting the six Shrrrfffs standing outside with brandished steel. "Arrest, huh?" he sneered angrily. "On what charge?"     "On these charges," the lead Shrrrfff answered, bravely backing up a step. "On charges of Gate-breaking, and Not Signing Out, and Muddying the Roadways, and Breaking and Entering, and Stealing Food, and Carrying Unregistered Swords, and Attempting To Start A Fire, and Improper Handling of Canned Foods."     "And what else?"     "That'll do for a start."     "I can think of a few others," Moribund Brandybuck said coldly. "Like Running a Drug Cartel, or Conspiracy and Racketeering, or maybe Murdering Five Shrrrfffs In Cold Blood And Then Taking The Sixth Hostage."     "You've done all that?" the lead Shrrrfff garbled.     "I certainly plan to," replied Morrie, and pulling a deadly rapier he had stolen from Rohan he set upon the Shrrrfffs. Of the five that died only two of them found time to scream.     "Here, now, Robin Wheelburrow!" Sam said, looking at the bound and gagged Shrrrfff. "You'd better tell us what the hell has been happening around here! And be quick about it, because these exposition scenes are always way too slow."     "Mmmmmmph mmmpppmph mmh mmppppphh!" the young hobbit replied.     Morrie cut the gag from his mouth with a dagger. "No yelling," he growled. "I don't have time to make a proper Bywater Grin, but I can always give you the old traditional Grin by carving a smile across your throat."     "yes, sir," Robin whispered inaudibly.     "Now what happened?" Sam snapped. "We heard tell of some kind of Collage, or somethin' just as foul, like Decoupage maybe."     "That's College, not Collage," Robin replied, putting the emphasis on the correct syllables. "That was the Perfesser's doing. But that's all gone now."     "The what?" Sam demanded.     "The Perfesser," Robin replied. "You know..." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Lotho," he muttered subaudibly.     "Lotho?" Frodo and Morrie gasped loudly. "Lotho Bagg-"     "Quiet! Don't say it so loud!" Robin cringed. "It's Bad Luck, saying the Name. It's accursed. He's responsible for everything!"     "So these ugly brick buildings an' slate roofs, that's his fault?" Sam cried. "That ugly little bastard!"     "No, no," Robin stammered. "You've got it all wrong. The slate's good! Really good! Look, look, you don't get it, I'll explain it to you."     "Some long exposition's coming, I just knew it," Sam grumbled.     "Y'see," Robin Wheelburrow began, as his audience pulled up chairs and settled in for a long dull speech, "a while back some ugly squint-eyed Men came up from the South, selling magazine subscriptions to make their way through some College called Eyesore, or so they said. And most people turned 'em away and slammed doors in their faces. But old L-" he stopped, and then whispered the name " - old Lotho wanted folk to think he was educated, as if anyone would believe that, and so he took 'em in. And he fed 'em breakfast cereal an' bran flakes and in exchange they told him all about College. And so old - " again Robin whispered the name " - old Lotho decides he's gonna start a College of his own, here in the Shire. So he starts using his money to build these big gothic buildings, and a lot of books and suchlike, and starts to call himself the Perfesser. Put a lot of money into it, too. Started by getting a lot of cash from Bree, where he said it was an invest-mint, by which he meant he was putting a mint o' money into his vest, I guess. Anyway, then the economy starts going haywire, so he gets everybody to take out these student loans, only there's lots o' students and not much loaned, or so it seems to us. But he just keeps sayin' things like, If you think Edjucation is expensive, try Ignorance, an' A Mind is more terrible than a Waist, an' stuff like that, which sounded like some pretty meaningless platitudes from an ad agency if you ask me but people seemed to buy it, an' before long everybody's signing up to be a Student."     "You mean Lotho was teaching people things?" Frodo asked, having a hard time getting the gist of the conversation over the voice shouting angrily in his head.     "Well, he tried to, at first," Robin continued, as everyone settled back in for another trying bout of exposition. "But being a Baggins he didn't know very much to start with - begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo," he added hastily, remembering he was bound and Frodo was holding a sword, though admittedly holding it at the wrong end. "So he started saying, What College really is about, is Football, and he has this big wood Stadium built. An' that's really when the trouble started.     "Y'see, the Chief - " here Robin smiled, saying the name with pride - "the Chief, see, he didn't hold with building with wood. An' every day as the Perfesser had people bringing in wood an' putting up supports for the Stadium, that night the Chief would sneak in under cover of dark an' chop the Stadium to pieces. An' after a month or two of this the Perfesser sets guards all around the Stadium, and two nights later they manage to capture the Chief, and the Perfesser says they're gonna hang him the very next night, big public hanging, lots o' celebration and refreshments an' everything, just like the old-fashioned Shire lynchings Grampa used t' talk about.     "And true to his word next day there's lots of parties and celebrations, and the Perfesser's got lots of gin and brandies he's serving to everyone, an' as dusk comes he sets off all these fireworks to keep people entertained, like Gandalf used to: the big Wheel o' Fortune, an' the Jeopardy, an' one of those SurPrise is Right ones; with the little Bob Barkers, always been kind o' scared o' those myself, but some people seem to like 'em.     "And right at midnight, just as tradition calls for, right at midnight the Perfesser looks at the gallows and says: Do you have anything to say before I pass sentence? And the Chief, he just looks down from the trapdoor, and he smiles, and in a big booming voice he says this:     "I have only this to say, says he. No Stadium shall stand in the Shire. The wood is your enemy, not I! Get rid of it, and quickly! You do not know your peril.     "And the Perfesser just laughs, and a bunch of his cronies - the ones with tenure, anyway - laughs along with him, and he raises his hand to pull the lever, when the smile just sort of dies on his lips and the Perfessor just stands there staring at the sky.     "And then we saw these things. Don't know what you'd call 'em, really; folk now call 'em the fire-flies, on account of they look like little moths that carry their own lanterns along with 'em. Damndest things. Nobody's really quite sure where they came from, but most think they were attracted to the fireworks the Perfesser'd been setting off. And one of 'em lands right on top of the gallows, and in a few seconds the noose-rope catches fire and burns right through and the Chief's free. And two or three others alight on the Stadium, and within minutes the whole thing's burning. Others started landing on homes, sheds, gardens, you name it; and before you know it the whole Shire is ablaze! The Perfesser, he tried to run, but before he could get more'n fifty feet a huge blazing piece of the Stadium tore loose an' landed on him an' crushed him an' set fire to him an' broke his back an' lit him on fire an'-"     "We get the idea," Pipsqueak yawned.     "Well, anyway," Robin went on, "the Chief gets down, and just as if he knew all along what was going to happen he calls everyone together an' forms squads, and he sends people to get buckets, an' forms one line down to the River an' another to the Lake, an' sends people to the areas downwind to evacuate and sound the alarm, like he'd been preparing for this day all his life. An' after the fires are put under control he calls a big meeting, and he says This is the way things are going to be from now on, an' he says what to do, an' everyone just ups and does what he says. And he got rid of all the wood everywhere, and nationalized all the student loans, and redistributed the sources of private fortunes, and had us rebuild everything proper, and gave us the new Rules to live by. And now all's well as ends better!"     "Rules?" Morrie snapped. "What rules?"     "Didn't you see them?" Robin replied, proudly gesturing with his nose towards one wall. "The Rules. There's copies everywhere."     The four hobbits turned to look, and saw a document carefully embroidered into a non-flammable fabric hung upon one wall:                     --- The Rules ---  1. There shall be NO MORE WOOD. We shall build a mighty Wall to     keep it out.  2. Any individual who hoards wealth greater than 0.25% of the     total Shire economy shall either redistribute it for the     common good or be put to quick and painful death.  3. All food, supplies and drinks shall be shared equitably by all     people, as moderated by the People's Board of Sharing.  4. Due to unacceptable health and social risks, beer, alcohol and     pipe-weed are hereby banned from the Shire forever.  5. Except in times of civil emergency, only Shrrrfffs are allowed     to carry weapons. Sword-control laws shall henceforth be     rigorously enforced.  6. All new buildings must be constructed of non-flammable materials     in accordance with the new SNSI building codes.  7. The use of fireworks within the Shire is absolutely and expressly     forbidden for all time.  8. Spitting within the Shire will no longer be tolerated.  9. Never, EVER, speak of He Who Must Not Be Named.  10. Thou shalt not bear false witness.  11. Neither a borrower nor a lender be.  12. Please wipe your feet before entering or leaving the Shire.     There was a long silence as the travellers contemplated all they had heard. Finally Sam spoke. "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute," he growled, disbelief twisting in the pit of his stomach. "Are you saying," he gargled, "are you saying the Revolution's already come, and I've missed it?"     "Yeah," Robin said cheerfully. "Isn't it great?"     Sam turned away in astonishment, too amazed to even attempt dialect. Morrie gathered the others together. "This is ludicrous," he snapped. "We didn't explore smuggling and business opportunities throughout Gondor and Rohan just so we could find ourselves demoted to peasant laborers when we got back. We represent the three richest dynasties in our countryside. We've got to do something."     "Like what?" Pipsqueak said obediently.     "Raise the Shire!" Morrie answered overdramatically. "You can see that everyone hates this - everyone who's important, anyway," he added, with a disparaging glance towards the bound Shrrrfff - "and they'll all be eager to see these grubby little peasants set back to rights. We'll get the Families. Tonight we'll sneak out under cover of darkness and get our clans together, and tomorrow we'll have a secret meeting to plot counterrevolutionary terror. With good planning we'll be back at the top of our ivory towers within a week and this 'Chief' will be a beggar in the wilderness. Or better still a beggar in the Brandywine with fancy new cement overshoes."     "What about Sam?" Frodo asked in a rare display of cognizant thinking.     "Sam," Morrie snapped. "Stupid leftist bastard. We'd better eliminate him." And in a flash he drew steel and whipped around, only to find the door open and Gamgee gone. "Damn him!" Morrie shouted. "He's escaped! We'll have to start moving now, before he can raise the cry against us. To the Families! Steal ponies and ride, ride hard! Bring all the forces you can muster to the Three-Farthing Stone by midday. The Counterrevolution begins!"     With that the three ran enthusiastically to the door, Morrie only hesitating long enough to put a sword-point through Robin Wheelburrow's defenseless throat.     Frodo, after stealing a pony but accidentally drowning it in the River, snuck through the grass on foot near the Sackville-Baggins estate. What he had seen of this part of the Shire was striking: instead of living in holes in the ground hobbits were now living in charming aboveground homes of stucco and stone, with little balconies and modest terrazzo sunrooms, and everyone seemed happy and well-fed. Even people he recognized as being his former wage-slaves seemed as content as he'd ever seen them. He withheld a shudder and continued on.     At last he neared the Sackville-Baggins mansion, and was surprised to see it partially burned, since he hadn't paid much attention to the story; but workmen were rebuilding the walls with stately brick, and keeping what they could of the elegant windows, and new marble stairs led up to the porch. But Frodo was unprepared for the sign: where originally Lobelia had a sign which read PRIVATE PROPERTY: STAY OUT OR BE SHOT, now there was a stone marker which read simply, SACKVILLE-BAGGINS CHARITY HOSPITAL - ALL WELCOME.     What the hell? echoed Bilbo's angry voice in Frodo's head. Charity my eye. Probably steals their wallets or something. Ugly old pincushion. Get up there! Ring the bell, you knock-kneed little twerp.     Frodo, fearing to get too close to the happy workmen, who might be somewhat less happy if they recognized him, fought down Bilbo's mutterings and instead went towards the back of the property, where he wormed his way in through a half-burned back door. In a moment or two he found himself face-to-face with Mumbo Sackville, a third cousin twice removed, once via the front door and once through a plate-glass window.     "Frodo?" Mumbo said in astonishment, lifting his reading glasses. "We hoped - well, that is, we thought you were dead."     Book-learned and about as useful as a drugged wombat, Bilbo's voice commented drily.     "Mumbo!" Frodo answered, feigning affection. "Is Lobelia here? And the rest of the clan? It's business, important business, and I'm in a hurry, so no gumbo."     "We were just heatin' up a pot," Mumbo said sadly. "But if you insist. Grandma's downstairs, in the fruit cellar. I'll just go upstairs and get Norman. And the rest; most of the family's here these days. Tendin' to patients, they are. Though Grundy's tryin' to tow a carriage out o' the swamp." And with that Mumbo departed, leaving Frodo alone to some inexplicable dread and the sound of squealing violins echoing in his mind. He slowly descended to the fruit cellar, and there, in the glow of a single bare lantern, he found Lobelia, sitting in a swivel chair facing away from him.     "Lobelia?" Frodo asked cautiously.     The chair swung around, slowly, ominously. The face of Lobelia looked at him. Her eyes seemed, to him, to be deep and empty, but suddenly the flash of recognition shot through them, and slowly she rose to face him.     "Lobelia," he said softly, "it's Frodo. Frodo Baggins. I need your help."     "I'll give ye help, ye dirty thieving ruffian!" Lobelia screamed, and suddenly began hammering at Frodo with her heavy iron umbrella. When the other Sackville-Bagginses arrived, it took five of them to drag her off him.     "Wait, wait, Nibs!" old Tom Cotton shouted. "It's Sam, Sam Gamgee by the look of him. Though he don't look like he's changed clothes in about a year." Nibs lifted his pitchfork and cautiously stepped off of Sam's chest, and Farmer Cotton helped him up. "Hullo, Sam!" he said eagerly, pumping Sam's hand in a piston-like handshake. "We'd heard you were dead, or selling aluminum siding, which pretty much amounts to the same thing."     "I'm fine," Sam gasped. "Except for my chest. And my hand. Look. Mr. Frodo's back, and Mr. Morrie and Mr. Pipsqueak as well, and they're planning to seize power. They're gathering their forces or somesuch. We've got to be ready to put the screws to them and step on 'em like last week's tunafish!"     "Can't say it doesn't sound like fun," Farmer Cotton opined. "Though the Revolution was surprisingly bloodless, y'know, and folks here mostly just wants t' live in peace with dignity and reasonably favorable economic circumstance. Once the gap between the rich an' poor was leveled off, most people realized they really wasn't in the mood for bloodshed. When everybody had enough to eat, and a warm place to stay and some opportunities for bettering themselves in different ways, people got more peace-loving and really weren't all that interested in class warfare any more. That's called non-hoarded prosperity giving dignity to all, that is. The Chief taught us that."     "But they're out to ransack the Shire and take back control of everything," Sam garbled.     "Well, that won't do, I suppose," Farmer Cotton replied. "Though a little bit of capitalism and potential for profit isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fosters thriftiness and innovation. It's just when wealth gets all centralized and you get a class of have-nots that it starts runnin' into trouble. But if you say they're plannin' to take over the whole Shire, well, then I suppose I could call a few o' the boys an' put the word out. Shoudn't take more'n, oh, about a week. Then we can discuss the possible social and political ramifications of such an attack at next month's potluck. Hey, d'you still make that potato salad you used t' make?"     Sam choked on his answer when he saw Rosie - lithe, riveting Rosie - come out of the farmhouse wearing a striking red dress. She had been listening at the window. "I think you look fine, Sam!" she yelled. "But if you'd been so interested in killing Mr. Frodo, why didn't you do it months ago?"     This was too much for Sam. It required either a weak answer, or none.     Pipsqueak rode his stolen pony out towards the northeast of the Shire, towards the Great Smials of Tuckborough, with a heavy heart. He didn't know how the Old Took was going to react. While the Tooks had always run their country with a deadly singlemindedness of purpose, they were never as mercenary nor as obviously greedy as the Bagginses or Brandybucks. Pipsqueak couldn't guess what the Old Took would think of the Counterrevolution, or how he would react to Pipsqueak for suggesting it.     In honesty Pipsqueak didn't know what he thought of it himself. He missed the old Shire, it was true; but the new Shire was neat, and clean, and orderly, and all the hobbits he had seen seemed happy, with the exception of the one whose pony he had stolen. "Sorry, sorry," he had mumbled apologetically. "Really very sorry. I'll bring it back when I'm done. Here's a receipt." And after finishing the paperwork he rode off with a curious guilty feeling. Where did that come from, he wondered? In his childhood stealing ponies was as common as singing songs, or beating up peasant children.     At last the gateway to the Great Smials, a stone archway erected long ago by the Keebler Elves to guard their ancient ovens, came into sight. Pipsqueak dashed through it, tethered his pony, put a coin in the meter and ran up to the ancient ancestral door. Half a dozen arrow-tips appeared at tiny holes around the edge of the doorway, a time-honored ritual dating back to Goribund Took the Solicitor-Free. "What d'ye want?" said the deep menacing voice of the door-ward within.     "I am Paragraph Took, son of Palatine Took and Macy Loosemoral," Pipsqueak answered. "I seek an audience with the Old Took."     "Paragraph Took? We'd heard young Paragraph was dead. Prove your identity!"     Pipsqueak nodded. So it was to be the Trial. He understood. "I stand ready," he replied, as was the ancient custom, "and on afterburners."     "Who delved the Great Smials?"     "Isengrim it was, Isengrim the Mighty, maker of the Forge, Digger of the Great Doorsill, and - " he stood on one leg " - Wielder of the Ill-Omened Shovel."     The voice sounded pleased. "Why are the Smials underground?"     Pipsqueak recited the ancient linnod by rote. "Why shouldn't they be? Everything's gotta be somewhere. Mind your own business!"     Again the voice was satisfied. "Can you produce the Ancient Key?"     "C-flat," Pipsqueak replied obediently, humming one scale. "It's kept under the Mat."     "Well, then, use it and come in."     "Right."     Pipsqueak flipped up the mat, grabbed the rusty key, and let himself in. Inside the Great Hall things had not been changed, and he was reassured to see his coat-hanger was still empty. "Good to see you, Pipsqueak," the doorward, Fahrenheit Took, said. "We'd heard you were dead, or maybe selling aluminum siding, which amounts to the same thing."     "I don't know how these rumors get started," Pipsqueak muttered.     "You made it in time for breakfast," Farrie continued, gesturing up the Central Stair. "It's the Count today, you know, chocolaty marshmallows? Most have already finished, but everybody's still there, awaitin' the High One. Hasn't eaten yet."     "Good, that's good," Pipsqueak answered. "I need to talk to everybody, and I haven't much time." With that he darted up the stairs, and burst into the Great Hall of Breakfast set in its mighty chamber.     The sun shone through the high eastern windows, reflecting down upon the great velvet curtains, red and electric blue, which always used to give him a nosebleed when he looked too hard at them. Forsaking his usual spot he went directly to the Adults' Table, without permission, a thing only done by three Tooks in all of history, and two of them were still to this day stuck downstairs doing dishes. "Hear me!" he shouted, and the table gave way to consternation then fell silent. "There is a rebellion planned against the Chief. It is taking place today! I must know if Tooks will support it or not. I must have an audience with the Old Took!"     There was a hush. The High One's seat at the head of the table was empty. Everyone else seemed a little stunned. "Paragraph," old Adalgrime finally said quietly, "the Old Took is dead."     Pipsqueak stood long in stunned silence. "Dead?" he whispered.     "Yes," Adalgrime replied. "Didn't you see the new polo mallet's been added? Happened when the College burned down. The Old Took fell alongside..." here a venomous contempt crept into Adalgrime's voice "...the Perfesser. He thought he'd get tenure, and a wing named after him, but instead he got the Ash and the Fire."     "Oh, my Eru," Pipsqueak gasped. This was too much. The Old Took was the only leader Pipsqueak, and most other Tooks, had ever known. "But... if he's dead..."     "No leader can stand forever," said a new voice, ringing from the shadows. All heads turned to the darkened entranceway at the high end of the table. "Even the Old Took could not prevail against Time. But a new leader of the Tooks has been chosen." A figure could be faintly seen approaching the table, walking slowly but with great strength and dignity out of the shadows.     "Paragraph," the figure continued, "you are welcome. You have brought us news, and have even come to the Adults' Table, risking infinite washing and dishpan hands, to do so. I appreciate your sacrifice. But now, you must keep silent. It is my job to decide how the Tooks shall proceed in this crisis." And with that the High One entered the light, and cast back the hood of the cloak.     Pipsqueak swallowed. "...c..." he stammered. "...Cassie?"     The paths to Brandy Hall had changed. The main road was still in its normal place, of course, though it had been repaved with beautiful new fishscale stones, and the slums had all been burned and then elegantly rebuilt. But Morrie, who never took the main road because he knew it was full of potential witnesses, took his usual back-way through the trees and under Deadman's Hollow.     The trees were gone. The back-way road was now an amiable brick thoroughfare, and where he expected the entrance to the Hollow he instead found, to his horror, a double row of gift shops and small restaurants and a couple of bed-and-breakfasts. A short pier at the River where Morrie had more than once dropped off business associates attached to large rocks now stood host to a large tour-boat, its sign touting SCENIC RIVER TOURS OF THE BRANDYWINE - THREE TIMES A DAY! He stared in amazement and then rode on, two or three couples in a sidewalk cafe idly looking up to watch him pass.     Even the Hollow was paved! Only a few ashes remained of the scrubland which used to provide cover from prying eyes. Morrie felt like he was in an alien world. Even the scrubbed and disinfected land of Gondor felt more slippery and dishonest than this - this, the very place where he had first learned his craft! Whoever this Chief was, he was going to pay for all this with his life.     At last he reached the stables of Brandy Hall. He breathed a sigh of relief; here, at least, things didn't look as wholesome. Mordred Brandybuck was still there, and still cursing his horses as usual. "You foul useless nag!" he was shouting at one sweaty, exhausted horse. "Get the hell back onto that track or I'll fill a glue bottle out o' ye!"     Morrie greeted him in the traditional Brandybuck way. "Get the hell out my way, you ugly mangy old bastard! Or I'll ride you down."     Mordred looked up him, and squinted. "Who the hell are you?" he sneered. "This is still private property, y'know, whatever the so-called Chief might say. We don't hold with all these so-called 'community property laws' out here."     Morrie smiled. This was more to his liking. "Glad to hear it," he replied. "Go wake the Family! There's business to discuss. I want to put out a hit. A big hit. There's a so-called Chief I want to take and put in an all-wood box."     The older man regarded the younger in amazement. "An' what name shall I give the Family?" he asked.     Morrie smiled. "Moribund Brandybuck," he grinned intimidatingly.     "'Scuse me?"     Morrie was amazed to find the older man staring at him in disbelief. "Mor-i-bund Brand-y-buck!" he enunciated. "You know? Morrie? The Mobster? Moribund son of Sorrowduck? The four-year-old kid who stabbed your favorite horse in the fetlock and got away with it because you were scared of him? You know damned well who I am, old man. I'm your worst nightmare."     The older man's eyes betrayed fear, but he was still defiant. "I don't know who the hell you are, you foul-tempered little whelp," he snapped, "but you sure as hell ain't Morrie Brandybuck. I know Morrie. I've worked with Morrie. Kid," he continued with a sneer, "you're no Morrie Brandybuck."     Morrie was beside himself. He pushed himself out of the way. "Ain't I?" he shouted, drawing steel. "Ain't I? Where do you think I am, then? Missing? Dead? Selling aluminum siding? Listen, stable boy," he sneered, holding his sword-point at Mordred's throat, "you tell the Family I'm here or you'll be in a glue bottle yourself faster than you can say Elmer."     Mordred stared back angrily, and with more defiance than Morrie was accustomed to seeing from anyone, but at length he turned on his heel and walked towards the back entry of the Hall. Bucklebelt Hall! It was good to see it again. Morrie noted there was fire damage here, too, but not too extensive. Having the River close by the house probably made the difference.     "Hey," he heard the old man call inside. "There's someone out here demanding to see the Family... That's right... And he claims he's Morrie Brandybuck!"     Morrie let his gaze wander. Even here there were stacks of fresh-cut granite blocks, over by the fieldhands' entrance, awaiting the renovation of the Hall. Might not be such a bad idea, he had to admit. More secure in case of siege. Extra stones could be handy for drowning difficulties. He was considering how to pave over some old burial sites when the Family began filing out.     There was Mordred again, stupid old fool. There were Gorbadass and Marmadoc, who started the Insurance; they'd be with him. There was Rorimac - Old Rory, 'The Goldfather'. He knew a good thing when he'd seen it. He'd go with the plan. There was Madoc, the proud-necked fool, and that ugly old Hanna; they'd protest, but it'd need more than them to vote him down. There was Gorbulas, and Mentha; they could be swayed. And there was...     No.     It couldn't be.     "This absolutely can not be happening," Morrie said in a dangerous growl.     "Oh, ho, it can," the figure answered happily. "Ja, ja! A long trip it was, ho ja, yet here I am, back in the embrace uf my luffing Family. Happy am I to be here! And who are you, there, stranger?"     "You know damned well who I am," Morrie shouted. "You know damned well why I'm here! What I can't figure out is what you're doing here. What'd you do, Otto? Sweep the floors? Offer to dust their countertops? Did you bring your cleaning supplies with you, you filthy Nordic bastard?"     Otto grinned. "'Otto'?" he asked happily, stroking his beard. "Nope. Must be someone else you've been thinking of there. My name ist Morrie Brandybuck, und this is my home, ant these people are my luffing Family! We are all very happy together, ja! But perhaps you are mistaken. Perhaps you are gone to the wrong House?"     Morrie allowed himself one brief moment of shock and disorientation, then put it aside and jumped off his pony with steel in hand and fire in his eyes. "I should have killed you in the White Tower, janitor," he sneered. "But I'll have more fun doing it here at home, slowly." He stepped forward, and was stopped dead by the sound of ten cutlasses appearing in the hands of his family members.     They were all pointing at him.     "You even think it," Old Rory said slowly but with great presence, "and you'll be dead before you hit the River. Or you'll wish you were."     "I can't believe this," Morrie expostulated. "Look at me! This is what I look like! Now look at him! The beard! The bushy eyebrows! The hands calloused from scrubbing bathrooms! Does he even look like me? Did you recognize him when he came home to Mother? Did you?"     "Well, no," old Rory admitted. "But that's to be expected. He was much changed, you know, due to his travels and all."     "That's lunacy!" Morrie shouted. "He was much changed because he's an impostor! A badly-dressed, short, ugly, lice-infested bleach-drinking impostor with an impossible dialect! Now look at me! Look: the dueling scar! The knife-cut over the ear! The beady, glinting eyes! Look," he said, reaching into a pocket for his greatest personal treasure, "my old brass knuckles with 'Punched By Morrie Brandybuck' engraved on the front surface in relief! They were a gift from you, Rory-"     "Ja, ja," Otto cut in quickly. "I lost those! You must've found them."     "-so why don't you admit that you made a mistake, throw this guy into the rendering vat and welcome me home?"     The Family looked at him indecisively, then turned to Old Rory. The old man regarded him slowly for a long moment. "Well, there is a resemblance," Rory owned. "You do look and sound a fair lot like him. Though the real Morrie didn't float two inches off the ground like that."     Morrie looked. He was floating. Stupid Ment-draughts!     "I'll give you one chance," Rory continued. "Prove to us that you are Morrie Brandybuck. I'll ask each of you one question. The one of you that gets the answer right can stay. The one that gets it wrong will be banished. If he's lucky.     "Seven years ago," Old Rory continued, "Gorbadass and Marmadoc were collecting insurance from the Hardgirdles. Fiona Hardgirdle refused to pay the premium. What happened three nights later? Stranger?" His level gaze fell on Morrie.     "That's easy," Morrie smiled grimly. "Marmadoc took Fiona's son Finkle for a ride. He took him on the Mild Swamp Run, extra-slow. Next morning Fink was found half-drowned in a peanut-butter truck. He kept shouting something about 'worms, worms in the deep'. Fiona paid Gorbadass the protection money promptly that afternoon along with a 15% gratuity."     Old Rory nodded once, slowly. He turned to Otto. "Morrie," he proceeded, "seven years ago Gorbadass and Marmadoc were collecting insurance from the Hardgirdles. Fiona Hardgirdle refused to pay the premium. What happened three nights later?"     "I don't know. What?" Otto answered genuinely.     "Fiona's son Finkle was found half-drowned in a peanut butter truck the next morning," Rory continued. "They say he was found shouting 'worms, worms in the deep'. Fiona paid her insurance premium that afternoon and it never happened again."     "Really? Gosh!" Otto replied automatically. "First I'd ever heard uf that kind uf story. What an amazing, um, thing! Nope, completely news to me. First I'd ever heard uf any such story like that one there."     "Ah-HA!" Morrie shouted. "See? See? Ha ha ha haa! That settles it, then!"     Old Rory looked at him slowly. "That's right," he answered quietly, "it does." He stepped slowly up alongside Otto. Morrie could see fire burning in his eyes. "A lot of people in the Shire have heard all the rumors about old Fiona. But a Brandybuck..."     Here his eyes lifted, and fell full on Morrie.     He put his arm around Otto. Morrie felt a cold nausea stirring in the pit of his soul.     "A true Brandybuck," Rory continued, "would never admit to knowing anything about it."     It was three hours past midday, and Frodo was getting worried. He was at the Three-Farthing Stone, a handful of Bagginses and Sackvilles accompanying him, and there had been no sign of Morrie or of Pipsqueak. Okay, Pipsqueak was unreliable. He probably got lost or went into an amusement park or something. But Morrie was as punctual as Death. What could be delaying him? Had Sam caught him?     He looked around again. The Three-Farthing Stone used to be such a joke. Legend had it that old Jatuzik Oldbuck had planted the stone at the exact center of the Shire's main road-crossing as a traffic obstacle, then offered to remove it for the sum of three farthings. Absolutely no one would pay him, though, and everyone just got into the habit of going around it. Now, Mumbo Sackville had explained to him, it had become revered. "During the night of the Fire, six fire-flies landed on it," he explained. "Three of them got squashed under the Chief's Axe, and young Odo Bigfoot rolled the stone over onto the other three to crush 'em. It helped turn the tide that night. Now everybody's saying the Stone's a national treasure, and old Jatuzik put it there by divine inspiration. Might even be true, for all I know," Mumbo had added, having the decency to look slightly embarassed.     And now there was this Park. They'd repaved the roads, moving them several yards off to the side as they did so, and now the area of mud and dried twigs had been cleared and neatly landscaped, picnic tables put in, and fresh green grass planted and generously watered. A small fountain had been built around the Stone, and the water tinkled merrily over the soaking obelisk. When had this happened? It couldn't have been very long; yet the fifteen or twenty Sackville-Bagginses there were eating and playing lawn darts as though they'd been doing it there for years. Frodo had even watched a little child from a peasant family, not more than three or four, walk up to the Three-Farthing Stone, touch it gently like a holy talisman, then blush and run away. What the hell had become of the Shire? Where the hell was Morrie?     At last he heard a sound: the sound of ponies, and a disheartening little honk, honk which he recognized as a cheap souvenir Horn of Rohan. He stood. From eastward came the trudging of ponies, not more than fifteen or twenty, with Morrie riding slowly in the lead. He looked like he'd been dragged through a swamp, and maybe a river and some gravel as well.     "Morrie!" Frodo shouted. "Morrie! Thank Eru! I thought you'd never get here."     Morrie looked pained. "Otto," he whispered. "Call me Otto."     "What? But, Morrie, you-"     "Otto! Look, just shut up, I'm in no mood to explain. This it?" Morrie asked, gesturing to the fifteen or so disgruntled relatives Frodo had brought with him.     "Uh, yeah," Frodo admitted. "This is what I could find. Most of the family..." He swallowed. This was hard to admit. "Most of the family seems to like things now." Frodo saw the look in Morrie's eyes and swallowed. "Maybe it's because Lotho was-"     "Don't say the Name!" a chorus of nearby Sackvilles hissed.     "-was responsible for all this," Frodo continued. "They seem to feel... guilty," he ended, the very concept of the word feeling alien and unfamiliar in his mouth. A Baggins, feel guilty? It was like saying they were made of cream cheese. "But what about you? Where's the rest of the Brandybucks?"     "Not coming," Morrie said shortly.     "Not coming!" Frodo said in amazement. "But you said you'd bring an army. You said almost everyone in the Hall would support you."     "I did," Morrie replied in a monotone. "These are the Brandybucks who don't support Morrie."     Frodo just stared. The Brandybucks dismounted, and began mixing with the Sackvilles and Bagginses. They had brought some provisions, including fresh Kool-Aid and more potato salad, which they proceeded to share. "Unbelievable," Morrie grumbled to himself. "About as rebellious as a plate of cheese fries. Pipsqueak been here yet?"     "No," Frodo replied, nursing an umbrella bruise. "He's probably out eating cotton candy or something."     "Well, maybe this'll do," Morrie muttered to himself. "We use a few to create a distraction, maybe start a fire if anyone in this rabble still knows how to light one. That ought to bring this Chief and his ilk, and if this pile of apes can make a clear path to him you and I can move in for the kill. No, maybe I'll go in by myself," he added, looking again at Frodo. "We'll set up in Bywater; Bywater's good ambush country. With a few more people we'd have better odds of doing it and staying alive afterwards, but if we can retreat quickly-"     "Look!" Frodo gasped in amazement.     Along the northeast road they could see troops - troops, a hundred strong already visible in the distance and more appearing, the sun glinting off their many swords wielded proudly in direct defiance of Rule Five. A familiar figure strode proudly at their head. "I'll be damned," Morrie said in amazement. "Pipsqueak! Pipsqueak Took! Who would ever believe he could do anything right? And he's got at least a hundred Tooks with him!"     In fact it was fully three hundred; all of Took-land had emptied with the news, and Pipsqueak had been put in charge of them all. Onward they came: Fahrenheit, and Faraslax, and Roquamunda Took, and Pancho and Sancho, and Adalgrime, and Torquamanda, and fiery Tabasco, and even Oleomargarine Took sitting straight and proud in his wheelchair. They filled the picnic benches and overflowed them, spilling out everywhere onto the grass. At last Frodo saw the one Took he was especially hoping to see.     "Cassiopeia!" he blurbled, going up to the beautiful young Took. "Oh, I can't tell you how many times I've thought about you!"     "Paragraph told me you were here," Cassiopeia replied sweetly.     "Oh, it's gonna be grrreat," Frodo said stupidly, like a half-witted breakfast cereal ad. "We're going to kill the Chief and his men and restore the old socioeconomic order and reestablish an unfavorably weighted capitalist economic system. After that, mmmaybe..." He paused. He swallowed. "...mmmmmmaybe I could take you for a milkshake?"     "Hmm," Cassiopeia answered noncommittally, though she was still smiling. "I admit I'm very interested in what you're planning. So tell me: what kind of scheme do you have for dealing with the Chief?"     Frodo told her, making sure it sounded like his idea and not Morrie's. "Now that we've got more people, we might make some changes," he added. "But I'm sure it'll be Bywater, tonight. Afterwards maybe we can get together and celebrate."     Cassiopeia smiled brightly. "Oh," she said simply, "after tonight there'll be a celebration, all right. You can count on it." And with that she shot him one final mysterious grin and vanished back into the crowds.     Frodo felt very pleased with himself. I wish I still had the Ring, he thought to himself.     I wish I did, too, Bilbo thought angrily back. And we'd have it now, if you didn't have clam chowder for brains. This place is a damnable mess! How can you even think in here?     That night their plans were made. On the Hobbiton Road in Bywater, not far from Bagshot Row and the dwellings of the Chief, the mutineers brought cartloads of wood which had been hoarded by the Brandybucks in direct violation of Rule One. At dusk they set the wood up for a huge bonfire in the middle of the road; and the rebels, three hundred thirty strong, took their positions in hiding at Pipsqueak's command as Morrie and Frodo went ahead to light the bonfire. "I'm looking forward to finding out who this so-called 'Chief' is," Morrie sneered. "I'm going to make him suffer for what he's done to the Shire. And after he's dead," he added malevolently, "I'm going to go after that bastard Otto."     "I thought you said you were Otto," Frodo frowned.     "Skip it," Morrie grumbled. "Do you have a tinderbox? Or a match?"     "Nope," Frodo replied.     "No?" Morrie snapped, furious.     "No!" Frodo replied. "I dropped my pack when we were running from the fire! Remember?"     "That was back at the beginning of the chapter," Morrie sneered. "Nobody can remember back that far."     Certainly not the readers, Bilbo echoed.     "Well, can't you light it?" asked Frodo.     "You can't guess?" Morrie snapped. "I can't believe you even had to ask. You brainless antelope."     You'd resent that, Bilbo added, if you weren't so damned stupid.     "Look, just shut up! -No, not you, Morrie. Otto. Whatever," blundered Frodo. "Look, I've just never lit a fire before, okay? That's menials' work. It's beneath me! Look," he continued, recoiling under Morrie's deadly gaze, "what do you expect me to do, anyway? Catch a Rogling? Steal some fresh fire from the Gods? Ask Sam to drop by and-"     "Oh, I'm already here," Sam replied.     "-light it for us? No, Morrie, Otto, whatever, if you're so damn smart, you'd..." Frodo continued, finally trailing off into a stupefied silence. He and Morrie turned. Sam was standing a short distance away, along with Rosie and a handful of stout peasants carrying a dangerous array of sharpened farm implements. In the shadows behind them Frodo could make out a small line of bowmen.     "Well, the worm has turned," Sam Gamgee announced. "I warn ye: you are standing in the light, directly under a streetlight actually which was very bad planning if I may say so, and ye are covered by archers. If you two do so much as sing a song with conservative lyrics I'll have ye both shot. Drop y'r unregistered illegal weapons and step back five paces! O'course ye don't have to if ye don't want to," he added maliciously.     Frodo dropped his sword, only to be kicked by Morrie. Morrie began laughing derisively. "Sooo! You think we're trapped? You think we're caught? Not likely, you sniping proletariat bastard. I think I've been looking forward to this moment even more than Frodo. Mutineers!" he cried in a great voice. "Attack!"     There was a great cry, and out of the darkness came Pipsqueak and his army of three hundred thirty armed rebels. They ran forward, with Morrie and Frodo quickly joining them. Sam and his small group drew their weapons and prepared to make a last stand worthy of a highly liberal song when a new cry, deep within the mutineers' ranks, rang out in a woman's piercing voice:     Tooks! Follow my command!     And the Tooks, three hundred strong, followed the ingenious and secret plans of Cassiopeia, High Thain of the Smials, and turned at once upon the mutinous Brandybucks and Sackvilles and Bagginses, whom they outnumbered ten to one, and tore their weapons away, and took all captive; and Paragraph their captain won renown by dashing forward and hewing Morrie's sword-hand from his arm before that chief of mutineers could harm the noble Sam Gamgee, icon of the proletariat; and Cassiopeia Took herself dashed fearlessly through the ranks of her people in time to deliver a devastating right-hand blow to Frodo Baggins' unresisting glass jaw.     Thus ended the Battle of Bywater, before it really began, and even before anybody could light the bonfire. It was accounted by many the last battle of the Revolution; though some contend the final battle came not then but later, in a land well outside the Shire, and a chapter or so further along. The names of all the mutineers were made into a List, and were carefully memorized by Shire law enforcement officers and immigration officials thereafter. Those named upon it were never cut any slack by anyone ever again; and at the top of the List in all accounts stand the despised names of Otto Who Claims He's Morrie Brandybuck and Frodo Baggins.     Morning came, though little light came through the bars into their cell. For some time Frodo and Morrie had slept fitfully, awakened at whiles by their injuries and the crowds chanting, "Kill! Them! Kill! Them!" rhythmically in the music-filled streets outside. The guards had put a makeshift bandage onto the stub of Morrie's wrist, and there was a chance he might survive, but the odds were against it, and he was weak from loss of blood; and Frodo, though better off, still had a stinging pain in his jaw and the irate voice of Bilbo screaming epithets and one-liners in the darkened corridors of his mind.     After a sullen meal of gruel and soggy breakfast cereal, the two were dragged outside by grim Shrrrfffs. "Come on, you two," the lead Shrrrfff growled, "your lawyer is here."     "Lawyer?" Morrie slurred. "We don't have no lawyer. We don't need no steenking lawyer!" And he would have continued ranting in that vein if he hadn't felt Frodo's hand gripping his injured arm in terror.     "You're our lawyer?" Frodo whispered in horror.     Sam Gamgee grinned. "Court-appointed," he replied cheerfully, "by the local magistrate. You've heard of her, maybe? The Honorable Lobelia Sackville-Baggins? Seems she's become quite civic-minded since the Revolution, helpin' the poor an' runnin' that hospital an' all; positively respectable now, if y' ask me. But, here, now; we need t' get back t' business." He cleared his throat, and took out a short roll of fabric with a long list of charges inked onto it.     "As I understands it," Sam continued, inspecting the roll, "you've been accused of the Murder of Six Shrrrfffs, one of 'em in cold blood, an' Smuggling Wood, an' Preparin' a Bonfire - shame ye didn't get that lit, y'know, because there's a hell of mandatory sentence for that one, an' it looks extreme even to me - an' Gate-breaking, and Breakin' and Enterin', an' Impersonatin' Respected Shire-folk, an' Rebellin' Against the Proper Order of Things - kind of ironic, that one; I always thought I'd be the one arrested for that - and Sayin' the Name, several counts there, an' Spittin' Inside the Shire, an' Unregistered Sword-Handlin', and Stealin' Ponies, an' Drownin' Ponies, that pony belonged to me Uncle Hamlong by the way-"     "It won't stick," Morrie cut in weakly. "Nobody read us our rights."     "Bein' just come from foreign parts, an' not having signed in, ye don't have any," Sam snapped. "Now there's a lot more here, but it's not relevant, you're both obviously guilty, so you may as well decide how ye want to handle it. What'll it be, then? Admit You're Guilty? Then ye'd go into work-release, outside the Wall, at the Quarries; there's a few other prisoners there, an' a surprisin' number of hobbits who are just civic-minded, too. O'course, since everybody remembers you, there's a big chance ye'd 'accidentally' get pushed under a slab-"     "Doesn't sound good," Frodo opined.     "Aye, ye're right," Sam agreed. "Much too quick. How about, Appeal Before The People? In that, ye get up on a big platform and explain to the whole Shire your side of things, and then they decide your fate. Now there's a possibility."     "I'd like that better," Morrie noted tiredly, "if it weren't for all those people over there chanting 'Kill The Interlopers, Kill The Firebugs' and waving all those kitchen utensils."     "Hm, well, it's your business," Sam said sadly. "Well, there's only one other option open."     "Everyone Forgets The Whole Thing?" Frodo cried hopefully.     "Give Us Swords And Let Us Hack Our Way Out?" Morrie suggested.     "Nope, it's Appeal To The High Authority," Sam said levelly, but with a kind of grim smile. He turned to the lead Shrrrfff. "Take 'em to the Chief."     There was an odd holiday sensation - half harvest festival, half public lynching - in the air as the crowds jostled Frodo and the weakening Morrie over The Bridge and towards The Hill. Frodo could just get glimpses of the territory through the thronging, singing people. It looked like most of Hobbiton had been destroyed by the fires, and now had been mostly rebuilt, in a beautiful style that he would have described as Italian or Mediterranian if he knew what "Italian" or "Mediterranian" meant. The ugly Quonset hut that Bilbo had built for the Party was completely destroyed, and a public library and open school now stood in its place. Inside his head he could hear Bilbo howling.     At last the crowds pushed them up The Hill. Here he got his first look at Bagshot Row, many of its mighty houses destroyed or standing as unstable structures of charcoal and ash. Then at the top of the Hill the crowd parted, and he saw Bag End once more, and for a brief moment rejoiced to see it was still standing. But a moment later Frodo found himself squinting in amazement.     All the wood was gone. The wooden windowsills and beams had been replaced by rows of brick, intricate tilework and elegant steel trusses. The round green door was now replaced by a bright red one, with a sort of flower-shaped shield inscribed upon it with four red petals, inscribed with the letters I A F F and the legend "Local 94 - Uniformed Fire Fighters".     The door opened, to a rousing cheer from the populace, and four hobbits came out wearing odd swept-back helmets and thick heavy coats - black coats on the east side of the door, yellow coats on the west - with strips of some Elvish material that took the sunlight and sent it back glowing like a beautiful sunrise back to the eyes. The four came to attention, revealing small argent shields each with a band of sable to remember the fallen, and then the Chief came forth.     The people cheered. The Chief stepped out of the doorway, gestured to his men indicating that they should receive the people's praise before himself, bowed only once (and with, it seemed, embarassment), and then turned towards Morrie and Frodo. In his hands was a large, steel-handled Axe which seemed vaguely, hauntingly familiar, like a childhood memory. To Frodo's surprise the Chief did not look much like Aruman at all, though somehow he had half-expected him to. In fact, though, he looked like... like...     "Fredegar Bolger?" Frodo whispered in amazement.     The Chief looked full upon him. "I can't believe you actually came back!" he shouted, half torn between amazement and anger. "I can't believe you bothered, after all that trouble you went through to leave. And to leave me behind, too, all the way back in the middle of Book One, making sure you'd be going through a forest just so you could get rid of scared old Fatty Bolger! Well, it seems I wasn't needed on your so-called 'Quest', so I made one of my own. And while you were out blundering around, visiting amusement parks and listening to grand opera and investing in Mordor real estate and pharmaceutical industries, I went ahead and saved the Shire and made it into something decent with my time."    "Oh yeah?" Frodo said, sounding surprisingly juvenile. "Oh yeah? Look, we just got back from a great Quest! We threw the Ring into the Fire and put a King in Gondor and defeated the evil Gandalf and-"    "Not what I heard," the Chief replied. "I heard some weird creature named Gullible destroyed the Ring, and that the King took the throne because his father-in-law the loremaster used ancient Brandybuck lore to murder the former Queen, and that Gandalf was actually defeated by some Earthsea dragons and an enraged Elf-lord. I've also heard," he growled, looking at their surprised faces, "that you were working for Sauron, that he'd promised you a large slave-plantation in his Eastern lands, that your friend here was planning to start a major drug trade in Gondor and Edoras-"     "Not true! Not true!" they both cried out.     "Is that a Deed sticking out of your shirt pocket?" he demanded of Frodo. "Is this the pipe-weed distribution network you drew up to show Pipsqueak last week?" he continued to Morrie. "And I also hear," Chief Bolger continued in the stunned silence which followed, "that you were planning to kill me last night and make the Shire an economically-divided plutocracy again."     "I wish we'd succeeded," Morrie hissed.     "Not me!" Frodo shouted, quickly putting some space between him and Morrie. "Not me! It was him! It was his idea! Not mine! I had nothing to do with it! I'm an innocent victim who just happened to be walking by at the time!"     To his surprise he saw Cassiopeia, High Thain of the Tooks, step out of the crowd just off to the right. "Frodo," she said levelly, "you told me it was all your idea. That you thought of everything all by yourself."     Nice move, idiot, noted Bilbo.     Frodo gulped. The weakened Morrie shot him a glance like a fistful of daggers. "Um, uhm, uh," Frodo began articulately, "that was just, uhm, an exaggeration, well, a bald-faced lie actually-"     "You lied to the High Thain of the Tooks?" Fredegar roared.     "Wha, ah, whah, wall, I know it looks like that, but, uh, I, uh-"     Shut up, boy! Bilbo roared in his ears. You're digging the grave deeper every time you open your mouth. Why don't you just slip into a coma and let me take over?     "Enough!" commanded the Chief, and with that one word all of Hobbiton fell into silence. For a long moment the Chief paced back and forth, musing on all that had been said. "Neither of you can be trusted," he finally said quietly. "Not now, not ever. A treacherous blade is dangerous even to its owner. Therefore I pronounce you exiled: you shall leave the Shire forever, and never be allowed to return. The West-gate is just beyond. Go!"     A murmur went through the crowd. "Don't let them go. Kill them! They're a pair of villainous murderers. Kill them!"     "Kill them?" the Chief asked the crowd. "Kill them? What would that serve? Would it brighten the sky, or improve the harvest, or bring the Shrrrfffs back to life? Or would it just make villainous murderers out of us as well? No, you can't fight evil by doing evil yourselves. You can't fight fire with fire. If you try, you just end up with a bigger fire."     The crowd fell into a hush, a quiet hubbub going from hobbit to hobbit as this idea was discussed. When the hubbub stopped Morrie and Frodo could see the people looking at the Chief with, if such a thing was possible, still greater respect. The Thain's voice suddenly lifted up with a cry of, "All hail the wisdom of the Chief!" And the cry was repeated by all, who then fell to cheering and sobbing for joy.     This outburst of good feeling, however, did not stop the crowd from hustling Frodo and the wounded Morrie straight to the West-gate. At the Gate they gave each of them a small bag with three turkey sandwiches, a bottle of Tang, and a map of the area with a marked path leading as far away as possible. Then, as the door-ward pulled back the twenty-three bolts and opened the Gate, Samwise Gamgee appeared with a slight smile on his face.     "I'll probably never see you again, Mr. Frodo," he said quietly. "And that's a shame, because if I ever saw you again I'd almost certainly end up gettin' to kill ye." And with that he drew out a pen and made two entries in the Gate-log:   NAME              PURPOSE                       TIME OUT  TIME BACK   O. Ex-Brandybuck  Wander, suffer &amp; die          8:43 AM   Never   F. Baggins        Suffer, suffer, suffer, etc.  8:43 AM   Even longerThe crowd surged forward. Frodo and the wounded Morrie were shoved outside. The gate closed with a CLANG and a series of twenty-three heavy thungs. Cheers and a song were heard from inside the Gate, gradually receding into the distance as the Shire returned to its many joyful tasks. Morrie and Frodo looked around at the lifeless desolation around them and the half-burned trees stretching off into the distance. A quiet wind, blowing dust, began to rise.     This is one hell of a fine mess you've gotten us into, Bilbo echoed.
        Without a word, Morrie began to drag himself off westward.  Frodofollowed listlessly.  Neither of them had the energy for the inevitableround of backbiting that would certainly follow if either of them openedtheir mouths.  Frodo, moreover, was entirely preoccupied with his internaldialogue.        Stay with me, boy, and I'll get you out of this, it chuckled drily.But Frodo was not so sure; it is hard to trust someone who has torn one'sentrails open.  The sun reached its peak, and without the shade of the treesto shelter them it soon became swelteringly hot.  Every time the wind pickedup ashes blew into their faces and choked them.  Frodo tried closing his eyes,but every time he did so he saw, against the red and purple of his innereyelids, a vision of Gullible silhouetted against the Crack of Doom.        Hours before the shadows grew long, both Morrie and Frodo had finishedtheir bottles of Tang, only to find that they were even thirstier.  Theirsandwiches were dry and salty.  By evening, they were both exhausted; theroad before and behind looked exactly the same, an ash-strewn path surroundedby burnt and fallen tree-trunks on both sides.  The Roglings had done theirwork well.        As the sun set west beyond Unter Den Lindon Frodo collapsed, lyingface down in the dust like a dead man.  Morrie turned back and knelt down bythe body, his one remaining hand checking Frodo's pockets almost by instinct.His hand closed around a letter.  But even as he drew it back he foundhimself unable to rise, and slumped helplessly over Frodo's fallen body.  Thedarkness took them both.        It was the song of a bird that woke Frodo.  He lay still for a while,eyes closed, only gradually feeling the uncomfortable weight of Morrie on hisback.  His memories fluttered in a cloud without connection or meaning, andfor a while at least the Voices were mercifully silent.  A bird, he thought.Where am I then? Hobbiton?  Rivendell?        Frodo's eyes opened to see grey ashes once again.  He tilted his headback a little, and saw -- a green leaf.  This startled him out of his reverie.He jerked his body sharply, and Morrie tumbled off his back with a muffledcurse.  Frodo raised himself on all fours.  As far as the eye could see, theforest floor was awash in a cascade of green leaves.  The black pillars ofthe dead trees stood up stark amidst the greenness, but there too leafy vineswere crawling up their sides.  Frodo almost thought he could see them growingand extending themselves as he watched.        Frodo tried to stand, only to find himself jerked back by one leg.A creeper had coiled itself around his calf.  Grimly, he set himelf to uncoilit.  He was not mistaken; it was putting out leaves even as he did so.          Morrie had put the letter inside his jacket as soon as he had come awakeagain.  The vast greenness, and the piping of the birds, however, dumbfoundedhim.  He sat on the ground and looked about, for once at a loss for words."Where the hell are we?" he asked.        As if in answer, the warbling of birds broke out from all quarters.And a mellifluous, cello-like baritone followed:         Il core vi dono,        Bell'idolo mio;        Ma il vostro vo' anch'io,         Via, datelo a me.        And in response came a beautiful, rich mezzo-soprano:         Mel date, lo prendo,        Ma il mio non vi rendo;        Invan mel chiedete,        Più meco ei non è.        And again the baritone:        Se teco non l'hai, perchè batte qui?        And the mezzo replied:        Se a me tu lo dai, perchè batte qui?        And at last their voices joined in one:        È il mio coricino         Che più non è meco,        Che più non è meco;        Ei venne a star teco,        Ei batte così, ei batte così,        Ei batte così, ei batte così.        With that there was an immense clap of thunder, and a flash of lightningfrom the clear sky.  When the dazzlement left Frodo and Morrie's eyes, they sawstriding toward them across the greenery two tall and beautiful figures, handin hand: one kilted but bare-chested, with a frog-mask; the other likewisetopless, with a skirt of shimmering red ornamented with black web-designsand a fish-mask.  Obviously this was yet another one of those avant-gardeMordortrash productions.        "Shelob!  Sauron!" gasped Frodo.  "But I thought you were... I thoughtshe had enslaved you!"        "Oh, zhoost for a leetle vile," Shelob answered with a smile.  "Vongets szo bored."        "The fall of Barad-dûr trasked her psyche somewhat," said Sauron witha sardonic smile. "And possibly mine as well."        "And did you do this?" Morrie asked, gesturing at the greenery withhis one good arm.        "No," came a voice from behind them.  "That was my doing."  Theyturned and saw Radagast, together with a strange little man in blue and yellow,who began to sing before anyone could stop him:        Ho!  Little hobbit-folk, traipsing through the woods-oo,        Lost amid the burnt trees, hair all full of kudzu!        Where be you a-going now, all your viands eaten?        Tell old Bombadil, or you'll soon be beaten!        And with that he produced a stout cudgel and waved it threateningly atthe hobbits.        "We've been expelled from the Shire!" Frodo blabbed, before Morriecould stop him.  "We're going to wander and suffer until we finally die!  Anduntil I heard Bombadil singing, I had no idea of just how bad this sufferingwould be!"        "Is that so?" said Radagast with a faint smile.  "Well, you have onlyyourselves to blame.  You know that Shelob tried to warn you about it: youburned down your own house when you destroyed Stinky's, she said, if I recallcorrectly."  Shelob beamed.        "You louse!" screamed Morrie.  "You knew that all this would happen,and you let us go ahead without telling us!"        "It was a test," Radagast answered with true Maiarin conviction.  "Tosee how much you have grown up.  And indeed you have grown very great; yousee, Morrie, you're a little taller than the other hobbits..." (and indeed hewas, as he was still floating two inches off the ground) "...and Frodo's alittle taller than you..." (and indeed he was, being six feet tall).        "What about Sam and Pipsqueak?" Frodo asked.        "They failed.  Their progeny will be destroyed when the jungle islet in upon Shire, and the elephants trample down their dwellings, and thetiger and the wolf roam in the streets, and the bitter karela shall coverall."  Sauron smiled ironically, but said nothing.        "Sounds good to me," said Morrie.  "But what about us?  We've gotno food, no drink, and last I heard you couldn't eat kudzu."        "You shall come with us!" said Sauron.        "Indeed," nodded Bombadil, "for we have:        Pepsi and Sierra Mist, potato chips, burritos,        Nachos fit for salsa dip, cheezos and tostitos,        Roasted peanuts too we have, of any beer shall drink ye,        Junk food brought from Bree-way, from Rivendell a twinkie."I'm going as well," added Bombadil.  "The end of the war has really eateninto my illicit activities, and besides, Goldberry threw away the key." With that Frodo and Morrie surged forward, and the two hobbits sat downwith the Maiar and had themselves a woodland feast.        For two days thereafter the six of them pushed onward to the east,and at last entered wooded lands where the fire had not spread.  One nightfallthey saw a strange glow coming from behind a hill, like the light of the moonon the horizon when it rises.  Sauron and Morrie slipped off towards it.  Whenthey came to the crest of the hill, they saw many flashlights lighting theground or the leaves on the trees.  Elvish voices, filled with melodies as ofmany songs, were speaking to each other.        "No, you idiot, it's back that way!"        "If we go in that direction we could be going in circles for days."        "This is what we get for following Dullborn the Wise: 'I used to holdthis area of Gil-gallamine', says he.  'I know a short-cut to the Havens,'says he..."        "Quit complaining!  It's probably just beyond the next hill!"        "That's what you said six hills ago!"        "Peace!" said Sauron in a great voice.  Six flashlight-beams focusedon him at once. "If you seek the path to the west, it is just over the nextrise.  Follow me!"  So they returned to the path, and one by one the Elvesstraggled in.  There were El Rond, Al Ladan and Al Rokar, Dullborn andGaladriel, and much to their surprise, Arwen, Queen of Gondor.        "What are you doing here?" Frodo and Morrie asked, but they wereignored until Shelob repeated the question for them.        "If you must know," El Rond said impatiently, "we are seeking a wayout of Muddle-earth.  Time was when this was a pleasant-scented environment,with lavender bath-water and attar of roses... but now these smelly mortalshave made it impossible to breathe freely, so we are going westward, wherewe remember a land of fresh-scented soap still lingers."        "And there too are many golf courses," added Galadriel, "where thetrees do not grow.  Cursed be he who spoiled Lothlorien with his wantonuse of Tree Essence!  No golf has been played on the overgrown links formany a day, alas alas."        "But Arven?" Shelob asked.  "I szought you vos to merry ze fatman, votzisnehm..."        Arwen pouted.  "I said I was going to wed the King of Gondorand Arnor.  And what happens?  No sooner do we get on the throne, thenthere's a rebellion in favor of Orkish Rights or some such nonsense, anda movement for union with Mordor, and before long somebody's proclaiminga Republic and forcing us to leave.  We didn't even get to take ourpalantariums!  He had broken our pre-nup, so I got an instant divorce,natch..."        "So who's in charge of Gondor?"  Morrie said, calculatingfuriously the political ramifications.  Arwen condescended to notice him.        "They had an election," she said.  "Can you believe it!  Anelection! Why, they haven't done such a thing for over 3000 years!  They havea President now: someone named Spiegel, who ran on a platform of Orc-humanreconciliation.  Nothing about Elves, of course."  Morrie wondered brieflywhether Spiegel was corruptible...        "Let us go on," Sauron said.  "There are miles yet to go before wereach the Havens, and we may discuss many things upon the way."        Long was the way they travelled, and bitter was the discussion (forthe Elves even got on each other's nerves), but as they had nowhere else togo they must perforce remain in each others' company until the end of theRoad.  And they came at last to an Elvish city, and entered the gates, andwalked down the long tree-lined boulevard that is named Unter Den Lindon,where Sauron sang many an operetta melody, and so at last came to the quaysof the Havens.        There Captain Cirdan greeted them, and showed them a White Star Linerwaiting to sail over Sea.  Crowds of people thronged the wharves, some toboard the ship, others just to see it, for it was the biggest of its kindever built, and was deemed unsinkable.  And there upon the gangplank stoodtwo clothed in turquoise robes; and one had a staff in his hand and was asugly as a macaque, with a golden circle about his head, and the other wasfat as a hog and held a sharp-tined muckrake.  Then Radagast was glad, forhe knew that Morenaughtie and Rumpustum, the Turquoise Wizards, were leavingMuddle-earth, and he believed that he would be the only Maia left to rulethe whole.        "Now you shall set sail for the Blissed-Out Lands," said Radagast,"and going there your hurts shall be healed forever.  Frodo, Morrie; I takemy leave of you.  May your journey be safe and may your end be what youdesire!"        "What!" exclaimed El Rond.  "I never agreed to sail with mortals!"And to this all of the Elvish company, for once, agreed.        Radagast shrugged.  "Well, I guess you're off the boat," he said toFrodo and Morrie.  "Too bad, but you know Elves are better than other folk."        Then Shelob blew kisses to the hobbits, and she and Sauron andBombadil and the Elves climbed aboard; and the siren sounded, and the shipwas tugged out of the haven, and slowly slipped out through the dank murkywaters of Mithlond harbor.        Frodo stood, dumbstruck for a minute or two.  Then he howled into thedeepening dusk: "Nooo!"  But it was not Frodo's voice.  "El Rond!  Youbastard! You promised me a ticket!  I'll get you if it's the last thing Ido!  My ticket!  I've got a ticket!  My precious..."  And with that he divedinto the ocean where the waiting arms of a beautiful puffer embraced him.        And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed into the West,until at last on a night of fog it struck a gigantic iceberg, and went down;no tale is told in Muddle-earth of who might have survived, although legendscirculated about a seductive eight-finned mermaid and a merman with astentorian baritone voice.        But to Morrie the evening deepened into darkness as he stood at thehaven, seeing only a glitter on the waters that was lost in the West.  Hestood there far into the night, until the noise of the waters repeatedendlessly in his ears became loathsome to him, and he never again went tothe seashore.        He turned around.  Radagast was gone.  The quays were silent anddeserted.  He drew the letter from his pocket and read it by the light of astanding lamp, then balled it up and threw it into the sea. "Birds andtrees?" he murmured to himself.  "We'll see about that."

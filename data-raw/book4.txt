        "Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten us into,"muttered Sam, shielding his eyes with his hand as he gazed eastwardover the bleak horizon.  Their wanderings in the Emyn Mail had broughtthem to a steep cliff, far enough above the ground below to makejumping out of the question.        "But, Sammy," whimpered Frodo, beginning to sob and whine andcontort his face in a generally comical manner.  He doffed his bowlerand scratched his head, causing his curly hair to stand on end.  Samcrossed his arms and looked askance at Frodo, rolling his eyes for thebenefit of an imaginary audience.        But beneath his outward show of exasperation lay a tangle ofturbulent thoughts.  Now you've done it, Sam Gamgee, thought Sam tohimself while Frodo sobbed on.  Played your hand when the game'sbarely started, and how're you going to get him back to the Shire if hedon't trust you no more?  Gruffly he said to Frodo, "I'm goin' off tothink.  You stay put, hear?"  Through his sniffles Frodo nodded.        Sam walked back up into the hills, settling on a rock bearingthe carven inscription "El Rond was here"; from this seat he had a piss-poor view of anything of interest, but could keep a close eye on Frodowhile remaining out of earshot so that Sam could indulge in theobligatory introspective soliloquy which should have been Frodo's backat the end of Part One.        "Ah, Rosie," sighed Sam, unbuttoning his shirt and laying onecalloused working-class hand tenderly upon his tattooed chest.  "Ah,Rosie, have I gone and mucked up the Revolution before it's a-begun?It felt good, so good, to give it to him straight, but the feelingdon't last, and what's left?  He don't trust me no more, Rosie, andthat won't do, not at all.  If he don't trust me, all our plans are fornowt, nohow."        Sam gazed thoughtfully, surprisingly thoughtfully for a working-class hero, over the land before him, bleak and barren save for theoccasional neon-lit oasis.  "I know, Rosie.  I know, I've known allalong, what I ought to do."  His gaze settled on Frodo's forlornfigure, hunched at cliff's edge.  He's still bawling, the git.  Samgave a snort, then sobered again as the magnitude of his missionreasserted itself in his inner vision.        "Ahhh," he sighed.  "I know what I ought to do.  But I amafraid, Rosie.  Simply afraid.  And if I do it, go through with it, dothe deed that must be done, will you think me any less a Hobbit?"  Samrested his plump chin in his plump palm and pondered.        Then, unbidden, it was as if a veil parted, revealing aVision:  Rosie, riveting Rosie, bearing aloft the Standard ofRevolution!  Revolution!  And surrounding Rosie the masses, theWorkers, oppressed no more!  And from the crowd arose the chant:  Forthe Shire!  For the Shire!  And suddenly Sam knew what he had to do,and how trivial were his petty parochial concerns about his Hobbithood,compared to the Great and Glorious Cause of Liberating the Shire.        "For the Shire!" exclaimed Sam, leaping to his feet, and verynearly ran right down the hill and took Frodo then and there, butfortunately the Great Vision vanished and Sam came to his senses,realizing that he still had a hell of a lot of explaining and bridge-mending to do first.  So he crept down quietly, on his quiet Hobbitfeet, to return, as a good servant, to his (gag - choke - barf)Master's side.        And damned if the silly git wasn't still crying and whining.        "I feared it was so.  I feared it was so," whimpered Frodobetween gut-wrenching sobs.        "Here, come now, Mr. Frodo," murmured Sam in his mostsoothingly subordinate tone.  "It's not so bad as all that."        Frodo gulped and looked up, blinking in bewilderment atSam.  "S-Sam?" he hiccupped.  "Your-your accent--?"        "Oh, that," laughed Sam with a good-natured and not-at-all-threatening working-class laugh.  "D'ya like it?  Learned it at aworkshop for the Shire Thespians Local 286."        "Why, Sam," said Frodo, astonished.  "I had no idea you were aThespian--not that there's anything wrong with that."        "Oh, there's lots of things you don't know about me, and that'sa fact," replied Sam cheerfully.  "But we'll have plenty of time to getto know each other a lot better on this journey--least I hope so."        Now Frodo was utterly amazed, all tears forgotten.  "Thenyou're not angry with me any more?  But what about all of that, back bythe river?"        "Oh, you know me and boats, Mr. Frodo," Sam joviallyresponded.  "My therapist told me my PTSD was under control, but lookslike I've still got me some issues to work through when I get backhome, don't it?"        Frodo laughed.  "Well, all right, Sam.  I haven't the leastidea what this 'PTSD' is, but from what I saw of it I hope it isn'tcatching.  Not something I should wish to contract."  He shuddered.        "Well, come along, then," Sam said, giving Frodo a heartyheterosexual clap on the shoulder.  "Let's find a way out of thesehills.  But how's this, sir?  We'll use our nimble Hobbit feet andclever Hobbit hands to climb our way down."        "All right, Sam," agreed Frodo.  "You first, then."        "Oh, no, sir, I couldn't think of it.  You're the master, sir,and I wouldn't be robbing you of your place of primacy."        Frodo raised his eyebrows, then nodded.  "Very good, Sam.  I'lllead the way."  Frodo lay flat upon the ground.  Just as he had loweredhimself over the edge and begun to creep cautiously along the cliff'sface, Frodo heard a terrifying shriek.  Instinctively he looked up, andhis blood ran cold:  A giant red-and-black LED banner scrolled acrossthe sky, proclaiming over and over:                 NAZDAQ DE-LIST SHARKEY ENTERPRISES.        "Ahhh!" cried Frodo, losing his grip; and all would have beengrim for him, indeed, had not Sam swiftly reached down with his cleverHobbit hands and grasped Frodo, hauling him back up to safety.        "There, there, now," soothed Sam, comforting Frodo with hisarms and body.  "All's well as ends well, as my Gaffer would say."        "Oh, Saaaam!" wailed Frodo, sobbing bitterly into Sam'schest.  "Better  if you had let me fall."        "Don't be saying that, Mr. Frodo.  You don't mean that, andthat's a fact."        "I do mean it, and that's a fact," cried Frodo.  "I amcursed, Sam, cursed in every way.  Unlucky in life, unlucky in love--"        "Here, now, you've had a few setbacks in the market, is all,"Sam consoled him.  "As for love, why, we'll find a way out of here andback to Rivendell, and that's a fact."        But Frodo remained inconsolable; indeed, at Sam's words he greweven more gloomy, and fell strangely silent.  Sam tipped his head tolook at Frodo with concern.  "Mr. Frodo?" he said uncertainly.  Frodosaid nothing, gazing morosely past Sam's chest at the desolate,cheerless land in which they had been stranded.  Speaking in his mostingratiatingly obsequious manner, which never failed to lift Frodo'sspirits, Sam repeated, "Mr. Frodo, sir, just think of all the lovelylasses thinking fondly of you back at..."  but his voice faded asFrodo's countenance grew all the more despondent.  Then Sam understood.        "You faked it?"        Glumly Frodo nodded.        "But, but the Lady Arwen, sir," said Sam, confused.  "Youweren't faking when you saw her, and that's a fact.  I saw it with myown eyes, I did, and that's--"        "The Lady Arwen was dressed all in leather and armor, andwielding mighty weaponry, Sam," Frodo miserably interrupted.  "Had shebeen decorated in the traditional accoutrements of stereotypicalfemininity, sitting sweetly at home sewing flags while the menfolk didall the deeds of valor in the world, I should not have felt so much asa twitch."        "Oh."  Sam frowned, pondering this new twist.        "I am doomed, Sam, doomed to wander without a place in anoppressive and heterocentric world, and it would be better for you notto be burdened with me."        "Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard," protested Sam.  Suddenly hegasped and drew back, staring at Frodo.  "Mr. Frodo, that's hard," herepeated wonderingly.  "Why, I never did feel no noodle like that, andthat's a fact!  A pity we haven't a lass at hand.  Perhaps we mightchance upon one, yet, if we ever--"        But sadly, ruefully, Frodo shook his head.  "Sam, dear Sam," hesaid, his voice laden with an existential anguish far beyond hisyears.  "Don't you understand?  I don't WANT a lass."        Now Sam was thoroughly confused.  "You don't...?"  But then,suddenly, it seemed to him that Frodo's face shone softly as if litfrom within, and all was illuminated for Sam:  He loves me.  He's likethat, and sometimes it shines through, somehow.  But he loves me,whether or no.        Then Sam realized that the illumination was coming from alantern hovering above his own head.  "All right, I take your meaning,"Sam said to the lantern, and it obligingly disappeared.  This isturning out better than I dared hope, thought Sam.  He looked back toFrodo, who was now gazing disconsolately over the barrenlandscape.  "Mr. Frodo, sir?"        Frodo turned doleful eyes upon Sam.  "Yes, Sam?"        "Are--are you wearing your Ring, sir?"        At this Frodo suddenly laughed.  "Dear, simple Sam!  Do Ilook like I'm wearing my Ring, you working-class ass?"        Sam blushed, and let his gaze drop before Frodo could see thesmoldering fires of revolutionary rage glowing therein.  "Well, no,sir, no you don't, Mr. Frodo, sir.  It's just that--"  Steelinghimself, Sam thought, For the Shire! and looked squarely atFrodo.  "It's just that I suddenly find myself wanting to kiss you,and, well, I thought maybe--"        Frodo's mouth fell open in surprise, then spread into a broad,delighted smile.  "Well, then," he said coyly, "kiss me, Sam."        Sam leaned closer to Frodo, then pulled back.  "Are you sureit's proper, sir?"        "What?  Two men together, you mean?"        "No, sir.  I mean, is it proper for a mere servant-boy to be sofamiliar with one of his betters."        "Oh, Sam," sighed Frodo, wrapping his arms around Sam, "you dosay the cutest things."        And so began the greatest Romance in all the History of Middle-earth.  The full Tale, all told, would require a dozen Volumes towholly tell; suffice it here to say that the world had never beforeseen a Romance so Epic, so Magnificent, so Moving and Tender, so Star-crossed and Riddled with Controversy, nor shall the world ever againknow its Like.  Long after all other Romances have been recycled intoshipping cartons, long after those who would have shelved this storydeep in the Oxford Closet have been likewise recycled, the Romance ofFrodo and Sam will live on, in time and in memory.        Many days wandered Frodo and Sam, ostensibly in search of a wayout of the Emyn Mail, but they weren't exactly hurrying about it, tosay the least.        "Mr. Frodo?"        Frodo looked up from Sam's fingers, which, like his own, werenow perpetually saturated and as wrinkled as prunes.  "Frodo."        "What's that, sir?"        "I think, Sam, dearest, given the degree of affection which weare now showing to one another, that you no longer need address me asyour master--unless that turns you on?"        "No," Sam answered decisively.  "No, sir, it doesn't."        "And drop the 'sir.'"        "Yes, sir."        "Sam--"        Sam gave Frodo his most winsomely proletarian smile.  "Yes,Frodo."        "Hmmm."  Frodo rolled onto his back and smiled dreamily at theclouds.  "How about, 'Yes, Frodo, my most beloved and only love of myheart and body.'"        Sam rolled his eyes and cast a surreptitious glance, laden withdark and revolutionary portents, toward the oblivious and love-besottedFrodo before reassuming the mask of cheerful and subordinatestupidity.  "How about we shorten that to 'Frodo, love,' and waste lesstime talking, if you take my meaning."        Frodo beamed at Sam.  "I take your meaning, Sam, love--and youreverything else," he crooned.  Sam affected a tender countenance andtook Frodo yet again into his arms.  Think of the Shire, he toldhimself, and distracted himself from the duty at hand by filling hismind with patriotic thoughts of Rosie the Red and the awaitingRevolution.        "Sam, love."        "Yes, Frodo, love?"        Frodo drummed his fingertips lightly upon Sam's very masculinechest.  "What's this about, then?"        "What's--ooooooh, thaaaaat."        "Yeeeessss.  Thaaaaaaat."        Aw, shit, think fast, think fast, Sam.  "Well.  Uh.  Why,it's--it's a Tradition, sir--love, Frodo, love--in the Gardener'sGuild."        "The Gardener's Guild."  One eyebrow rose.        "Why, yes.  Frodo.  Y'see, upon being received into the Guild,it's custom for each member to get a tattoo of his most fav'ritestflower upon his chest.  And, well, I, as you can see, I like, ah,roses.  Beautiful flowers, sir--love.  Beautiful."        To Sam's great relief Frodo accepted the explanation.  "Well,Sam, I must say I had no idea we had so many Guilds and Locals and suchin our very own Shire.  You know how I disapprove of Organized Labor."        "Oh, yes, that I do," answered Sam, pouring a load of subtextinto every word.  But Frodo's attention had returned to the tattoo.        "Hmm."  With one finger Frodo slowly outlined the word "Rose"beneath the flower.  "It shouldn't be at all difficult to change thisto read 'Frodo.'  Then," he smiled winsomely at Sam, "I'll always benear your heart."        Mustering a performance worthy of an Odogar (the ShireThespians Union's most prestigious award), Sam crooned, "You alreadyare, Frodo, love," and braced himself for another round of sweetnothings.        "Frodo, love."        "Yes, Sam, love."        "Don't take me wrong, now, but as delightful as these days havebeen, I'm thinking we'd better get to Mordor and get the job done, soyou have a proper estate, again."        "Oh."  Frodo considered, then nodded.  "You're right, Sam,love.  Now that I have you, I've no further use for that silly Ring."He raised himself from the ground, stood straight, and clasped hishands together, rubbing them briskly.  "Well!  How shall we ever findour way out of these hills?"  Frodo's eyes darted about this way andthat and he set his jaw, looking very grim and intent with the urgencyof his Quest.        "Well, Frodo, love," ventured Sam.  "I'm thinking we might takethat path, there."  Sam pointed to a wide, gently graded blacktop paththat descended toward the plains.        "Well!" said Frodo, pleased.  "I think I will trust to yourjudgment, Sam, love.  The path it is."  They gathered their supplies,strapped their packs onto their packs, and began the long but notterribly taxing descent to the plains below, stopping at a log cabinabout midpoint to refresh themselves and pick up a few maps andbrochures.        "The Dread Marshes," read Frodo from one such pamphlet as heand Sam walked along hand in hand.  "Oh, Sam, love, it soundsfascinating!  Is it on our way?"        Sam took a look.  "Seems to be," he said.  "I guess we can havea look about, see the sights.  But damned if I didn't forget to bringmy camera!  If my Gaffer could see me now, he'd be saying, 'Sam, youninnyhammer, didn't I tell you to always bring a camera wherever yougo, because sure as you don't, that'll be when you'll be wanting one.'"        "Well, Sam, love, there's no use calling yourself all the hardnames your abusive father berated you with," soothed Frodo.  "Besides,I bought a camera at the rest stop while you were busy admiring theflush toilets."        "Did you?"  Sam brightened.  "Good.  Good.  That'll come inhandy," he added under his breath, smiling to himself.  "Yes, indeed,it will."        They sauntered on down the path.  Sam cast a wistful glanceback over his shoulder, suddenly finding himself wishing he hadn't beenso quick to leave the Emyn Mail.        "There was LOVE!  All AROUND!  But I never HEARD it singing!No, I never heard it at all, till there was YOU!"        Sam looked over at Frodo with mild annoyance, but not withoutaffection:  and it struck him that despite his lofty intentions ofsocially redeeming revolutionary value he had gone and gratuitouslyfallen in love with Frodo.  Well if that don't throw a spanner in theworks.        "And there was MUSIC!  And there were won-der-ful ROSES!"        Rose.  Ah, she wouldn't be none too happy with him, shewouldn't, and he didn't think she'd go for settling down as a happylittle threesome.  But it was a long way back to the Shire; Samshrugged and put Rose out of his mind, determined to enjoy the momentwhile it lasted.        "Till there was YOOOOUUU!!!"        Easier said than done.  "Ah, Frodo, love, it might not be agood idea to be singing at the top of your lungs in a strange country.You never know what sort of riff-raff it might attract."        Just then a small, pale, androgynous creature stepped out frombehind a boulder.  "Hobbitses," it hissed lasciviously.  "Hobbit-MENNNS.  We likes, my Preciousss, we doesss."        "Exhibit A," muttered Sam.        The creature paid him no heed.  "Tricksy, tricksy Elf-wimmins,"it rambled on.  "Tricksy Elveses.  Tricksy Belden.  No mystery here, myPrecious.  Tricksy!  Promises us a feast of mens and then kicks uswhere it hurtses, nasty, nasty Elveses, never trust, never trust.  Butwe don't need Elveses now, my Precious, now we has Hobbit-mens all toourselves.  Oh, yes, we doesss--"        "Oh, no, we doesn't," snapped Sam, tightening his grip onFrodo's hand as he attempted to push his way past the creature.        But Frodo halted.  "Sam, wait.  I do believe he's that Guliblechap--"        "I'm not a he!" shrieked the creature.  "I'm a she!"        "What?" exclaimed Frodo and Sam in unison.        "I'm a she," repeated Gulible.        "But I'm told you're a he," argued Sam.        "And I'm told he's a virgin," countered Gulible, jabbing ascrawny thumb towards Frodo.  "But that's not what I sees, oh, no, myPreciouss, not at all--"        "And just how long have you been spying on us?" demanded Sam,blushing a fierce shade of red.        "Well, he may be a she," Frodo quickly interjected, tugging atSam's arm.  "What I'm told is never for certain."        "Well, whatever it is," grunted Sam, eyeing Gulible withsuspicion, "the sooner we're away from it, the better."        "No, no!" cried Gulible.  "Nice Hobbitses!  Cute Hobbitses!Sweet, sexy Hobbitses!  Nice Hobbit-mens take Spiegel with you!"        "Spiegel?" exclaimed Frodo and Sam, exchanging looks ofbewilderment.        "Spiegel is me, and me is Spiegel," declared thecreature.  "Spiegel, called Gulible because I once believed mens canchange.  Silly, silly Spiegel!  Bad, wicked, naughty mens, writingstorieses to please only themselves, storieses of buxom benippledwenches and frat-boy lusts, but nothing, nothing for poor Spiegel!  Nolusting after mens, oh, no, not allowed, not allowed!  But theRevolution is coming, my Precious, yes it is, when the Sisterhood shallbe powerful and the wimmins shall be gratified, and the mens shall notstop us, not the Hobbit-mens nor the Men-mens shall stop us now, and weshall overcome, we shall overcome, we shall overcome someday!  Now, nowSpiegel knows, yesss, my Preciouss, she does, she knows mens are goodfor only one thing, and when she gets the Precious back for her veryown, the Hobbit-mens and the Men-mens will give her all she wants, oh,yes, they will.  Oh, Precioussss!  The Blessed Precioussss!  Oh, theBlessed Precioussssss!!!"        "What an eccentric performance," muttered Frodo.  "Still, sheseems to be mostly harmless."  Interrupting Spiegel's catalog ofgrievances, he said aloud:  "All right, Spiegel, you may come alongwith us--but no more watching Sam and I when we're together."        "Oh, no, of course not, no watching," said Spiegel, not veryconvincingly.        "Swear it," growled Sam, flicking a switchblade.        "Spiegel swears it!  Spiegel swears it!  Spiegel be very good."        Frodo nodded, satisfied.  "Well, that's that.  Come along, Sam,love, and you, Spiegel."        Spiegel trotted along agreeably after Frodo and Sam.  Sam putthe knife away, but briefly pulled Spiegel aside to mutter sottovoce, "If you're really good, maybe I'll let you take somepictures."  Spiegel looked up at him with a libidinous gleam in hereye.  "Oh, for that, Spiegel be very good, indeed," she hissed, andin the meeting of their eyes was the meeting of two revolutionary andsubversive minds.
   Spiegel moved languidly, with her bust thrust forward so hard thatFrodo thought that surely her upper back must ache like sonofabitch,which it did.  Sam was in a fix: hand in Frodo's hand, Frodo's thumbcaressing; eyes on Spiegel's bosom; and mind ferociously on Rosie, RedRosie, Revolutionary Rosie.  Rosie with the athame and hands as swift asher temper.   Spiegel glanced at Sam and felt satisfied.  She started down the pathtowards the marshes, her small yet shapely bottom drawing Sam's eyeslike Playboy magazine draws adolescent boys and televangelists.  Thecat-calls from two passing joggers on their way towards the fast-foodjoint below proved that it wasn't just Sam: Spiegel was not as abhorrentas she thought herself.   Two hours later they were gorging cheeseburgers and french fries.Spiegel would at first take only a few fries and a bit of salad from oneof Sam's burgers.  "Gulible, you really should eat some more," saidFrodo.  "You look starved."  Looking guiltily at Frodo, the stick-thinhobbit-girl replied in song:         The greasy food         upsets my mood            it swells my bod.         I'm grossly big         I look a pig            I feel a clod.         I always feel ---   "Ha! ha!  What does we feel?" she said, looking furtively at the twomen.  "We'll tell you," she whispered.  "He told me years ago, Bagginstold me when I was just a little girl."  A shudder shook her body, andSam catching the look in her eyes felt a sudden sympathy welling in him.         Terribly fat;         Nose like a hat;         Always starving, ever growing;         Look like needing tugboat towing;         Never noticed till he said:         Boys would always want me dead!         Menfolk laugh behind my back         'Cause I waddle like a sack!         That's what Bilbo Baggins told         When I was just ten years old ---   Suddenly Sam understood poor Spiegel's troubles.  A self-starver, ananorexic little girl.  How beautiful and popular could she have been!Even in her emaciated state she was attractive.  With her green eyes andhair that when washed and tended would be a shock of flaming red, sheshould be the proverbial man-killer.   That was the deciding moment for Sam as far as old Bilbo Baggins wasconcerned: with just a few comments to an impressionable little girl,just to while away some tedious afternoons probably, this rich bastardhad shattered this poor working-class (Sam's assumption) girl'sself-confidence... oooh, Sam couldn't wait for the revolution.   Frodo felt a little of the same.  He didn't notice that she was (to astraight man) beautiful, but he felt her shame and knew how unneeded itwas.  He looked at Sam.  "Don't look at me," he whispered.  "I know aswell as you that Bilbo should not have said such things."   Loudly he said to Spiegel: "Look, old Bilbo is my uncle.  I know himbetter than you do.  He is full of bovine refuse.  You should have heardthose language lessons I took from him... you are not fat!"   "Yes, we isss!"   "No, you issn't!  Here, have a hamburger!"  He handed her aquarter-pounder with extra cheese.  Doubtfully she took it, and nibbleda single crumb.   "Ack ack phbttt!  Trying to poison poor Gulible they are, dumbmenfolk!  Grease and fat, Spiegel cannot eat that!"   "Come on," said Sam.  "Try it.  Give it a chance.  Frodo is right:you are thin as a twig.  Ten of those would do you good - ten each dayfor a month.  We aren't teasing you!"   "Yes you isss!  Baggins said we iss fat as a hippo in a butterfactory."   "And another Baggins says otherwise," Frodo replied.  "Why believe inhim and not me?"   "Becaussse he isss straight!"  The look in Spiegel's beautiful eyeswas venomous.   Frodo shrugged, not noticing Sam opening his mouth and shutting itagain.  "Have it your way then, fatso," he said.   This being the last restaurant for several days, the hobbits boughtseveral packs of vacuum-packed hamburgers in a nearby supermarket.  Thenthey started towards the marshes.  At first they followed a touristtrail, but this soon veered aside, and they left it.  They were in themarshes proper.   "I have been here before," said Spiegel.  "Hobbit-mens should becareful.  There are alligators here.  They don't touch me, because I'mtoo fat: I bet their cholesterol count soars at the sight of us."   "No, they won't eat you because gators eat meat and not sticks andwire with blobs of fat on them," replied Frodo, without noticing thehurt look that this produced in Spiegel.  Sam noticed, and his hateagainst the upper classes increased another notch.   Some time later, when Frodo was passing hraka behind a bush, Samtried again to explain to Spiegel that she was not fat.  "Have you heardabout anorexia?" he asked.   "Yes.  What's that got to do with us?  Only thin people who thinkthat they are fat have it!"   "Have you looked in a mirror?"   "No!  We hates mirrors!"   "You cannot honestly think that you are fatter than me and Frodo!"   "Yes we are!  Look!"  She grabbed a fold of skin between two fingers."Look like the Michelin man, we does!  Like a stack of car tyres.  Trucktyres!"   "There is no fat inside that fold," said Sam.  Spiegel turned awayand would not answer.   "Spiegel, why do you always refer to yourself as 'we'?"   "Because we are so fat that if ever we went by plane, we would haveto buy two or three tickets.  And boy would we be in trouble if theywere not adjacent!  Baggins said so."   "How would that old coot know?  He's so rowdy once he's had a drinkor two that every airline has him on a file - they refuse him wheneverhe tries to buy a ticket.  They've had enough of him!"   At nightfall they made camp.  Frodo took out the gas burner andinexpertly lit it.  Then he put a grille inside a thick-walled pot andput three hamburgers on it.  Soon a somewhat delicious smell spread.For a while Sam tried to convince Spiegel that she was not fat, whensuddenly she relented.  With a look of terrible revulsion on her face,she wolfed down a hamburger, and then two pounds of lettuce.  Samwhispered to her: "And please don't sneak off and throw that up!"  Aftera moment of thought he added: "You won't be a good girl if you do."Spiegel, the eyes of her mind upon Frodo's camera, sighed and curled upto sleep.   Some hours later she woke up, finding the camera placed next to her.The other two were gone, but from behind some densely leaved bushes camea quiet, rythmic rustling.  Heart pounding, she grabbed the camera andsneaked over to the bushes.  Quietly she peered over them, then put thecamera to her eye.   And then lowered it with a sigh.  Midnight and a low half moon arenot the perfect lighting for photographing without a flashlight, andthat was not an option.   The next morning Sam asked her if she had got a few good snaps thatmight be used for some revolutionarily useful extortion.  She returned abrief explanation.  Sam thought for a moment.   "Hey, Frodo.  I think we should stop travelling during the day.Spiegel says there are evil things about.  Evil things with eyes, andthey report to Minas Tirith.  It will go ill with your Núrnenshirehovel, er, estate if they get their hands on that deed."  Frodo, bynow trusting Sam totally, made no objections.   Sometime later that day, Spiegel got some interesting snaps amongthose bushes.   That evening Sam lit the gasfire.   "Won't those Minas Tirith-spies see that gaslight?" asked Frodo.   "No," replied Spiegel.  "For one thing, it is difficult to see thatlittle flame in broad daylight.  For another, marsh-lights can often beseen around here."   Frodo looked at Sam, who nodded.  A little later, Sam convincedSpiegel to have another hamburger, with extra cheese.  They were out ofgreen stuff, but she ate tomato slices instead.  Two pounds of them.  Atnightfall they packed their things and got started.   "What did you do that for?!"  Sam's voice was angry.  "Had a changeof preferences?  Suddenly like women again now?"   Frodo chuckled.  "Not in a lifetime.  Just wanted to see that lardwobble."   "Spiegel, don't pay that rich slavemaster no attention!  Just likehis father Bilbo, he is.  It's just one of them simian alpha-malepower-displays that that family is so fond of.  They'll be up againstthe wall the both of them one of these days, and you can be in thefiring squad!"  The girl, sobbing quietly, threw him a glance but saidnothing.   The night was dark, but not altogether so.  Civilization was farbehind them, and they were in a trackless land.  But miles and milesaway the lights of civilization were strong enough to illuminate thetops of the reeds even here: billboards, headlights, roving searchlightsreflected off the clouds.  As they walked deeper into the marshes,further from these lightsources, the night became darker.  Then the skyturned pale in the east, and the mountain fences of Mordor glitteringwith pinpoint lights showed faintly against it.  They made camp next toa wide mere.  Now they were deep into the marshes.  The ground was wet.The rustling reeds were tall, but there were no bushes.  To Sam'srelief, Frodo judged that they could have no privacy from Spiegel here."The reeds would rustle too much," he whispered coyly.  "They would swaylike clusters of flagpoles in a gale.  They would..."  Sam closed hisears to the rest.   Twice that day they cooked hamburgers.  During their first meal, Samcoaxed Spiegel into having an entire quarter-pounder.  "She alreadylooks healthier," whispered Frodo to Sam.  "Yes, really swelling," headded more loudly.  Spiegel maintained a stony look.  At their secondmeal they had to go without any vegetable stuff - she had eaten theironions, a whole pound of them, and her breath was not very nice for awhile.  More than once that day she had had the screaming hrakas.   Sam failed to convince her to have a second burger in lieu of thevegetables that she had followed up her previous three burgers with.  Atnightfall they set out.   Suddenly they stopped and shrank.  It was foggy.  Out of the air cametwo distant voices.   "...but honey..."   "You are not killing that fine man, hear?  Such a handsome, fine,strong, noble, handsome man!  I saw him in the trailer.  I think it washim anyway."   "But I did kill him!"   "He was not last seen dead!"   "But my plotline demands that he be dead!  It's my story after all!"   "And this is my skillet!"  &lt;clong&gt;   "Ow!  You silly old crone..." &lt;boing BOINK&gt;   "Say it!  Say he'll return to the story!" &lt;clang&gt;   "Okay, okay, hon..."   "Letting that fine man die and the miserable creature that stabbedhim live..."   The two voices trailed off.  Frodo shivered.  "What was that?  I feela strange and uncanny foreboding."  The other two shrugged.  Then thetrio continued onwards through the marshes.   "Aaah!!"  Frodo's panicky shriek rang through the night.  The othertwo turned like tops to face him.  "There is a dead man!  A dead man inthe water!  With weeds in his hair!"  He was staring into a wide poolwith several marshlights shining near the bank where he was standing.   "That's strange," replied Spiegel, approaching him with apprehension.   Sam cast a look at the dimly lit figure.  "It's the corpse of a manalright.  C'mon.  He's nothing to do with us.  Why haven't thealligators got him?"   "It looks like..." Frodo muttered to himself, unable to extricatehimself from the sight.  He bent down closer to the corpse.   With a splash a strong arm shot out of the water.  Before anyonecould react, Frodo was grabbed by the tunic, dragged into the water, anda shadow rose up out of it and pinned the wildly thrashing hobbit to themuddy bottom.  A mad fierce gleam was in his eyes.  The marshlightsshone like Griswold Christmas lights.  It was the man in the water, andhe was alive!   "Boromir!  Boromir!" cried Sam.  "You're alive!  But I sawhim kill you!"   Boromir did not reply, until Sam reached out from the bank andgrabbed him by the shoulder.  Then he pushed Sam back with one hand,still holding Frodo down with the other.   "Yes!" he cried.  "That he tried!  First he will take the Ring to theenemy who would devour us all, land and slaves being his promisedwages, and then he tries to kill me!  And then the others lash me to araft and send me down the Rauros falls!"   Frodo's struggling grew weaker.  A burst of bubbles came from hismouth.  Then Boromir drew his sword and pierced the drowning hobbitthrough the chest, to the hilt.   At dawn they stood on the bank of the little lake in the middle ofthe marshes, not watching the feast of the alligators.  On the groundlay pieces of wet confetti.  "Lies," said Boromir,  no longer, as hecast down the last bits of paper.  They looked like chads.  "Lies ofTyrannosauron and of El Rond.  And this," he fingered the Ring, "goesstraight into the fire.  To Mount Viagra!  It is an instrument ofoppression.  Are you with me, Sam, revolutionary Sam?"  Pointing at thered froth of the alligators: "Is something like this not what youdreamed of all the time?  I noticed the razor blade in his eggs!"   "You...you're the son of the Steward," said Sam.  "Yes, I can't saythat I disapprove.  Except for the signs at the tourist trails about notfeeding the litigators.  But you?"   Boromir sighed.  "I was always secretly uneasy about thecorporate-feudal oppression that my family inflicts on the people.  Thenthat little brat put his sword in me.  I had drawn sword against him afew moments before, I must admit..."   "I noticed."   "Oh did you?  Well, that opened my stomach.  But what really openedmy eyes was what happened after.  Bleeding like a pig I fought againstorcs, and they could not stand against me.  They clove my horn, but theycouldn't touch me!  The survivours ran off, and I believe Lego-lass andGiggly had their share of them.  If orcs it was: there was a strangemetallic gleam on them that was not armour.  They didn't bleed much whenI made great gashes in them with my sword, and what little blood camewas black.  Orc blood is as red as ours... but I fell exhausted with thewound that Frodo had given me.  And then... and then..."  Greater ragegleamed in his eyes.  "Aragon pretended that I was dead.  He questionedme, and when Giggly and Lego-lass came, he lied and said that I wasdead.  The other two believed him, even though I spoke and protested!They knocked me cold, and when I woke up I was tied to a raft anddrifting off the Rauros.   "How I survived I cannot explain.  The fall into the churning bowlbroke the raft into nearly sawdust, and I was free.  I was unable toswim, but grabbed a larger piece of wood and drifted down the river,until I was washed up on the east bank.  That Aragon is so wimpy at thesight of blood that he had closed my stomach-wound crudely with somerings from the chain-mail of an orc (or whatever it was), and that savedmy life then.  Otherwise my intestines would be trailing the length ofthe river by now ---   "I lay on the riverbank.  Happily the sword-thrust had gone in at thediaphragm, and missed the gullet and lungs and heart and intestines andthat.  That Frodo was tall for a hobbit, and I had been bending forward.It was the dirt on the blade that nearly finished me off, not so muchthe wound itself.  An old woman found me and carried me into a hut.  Shesaved my life.  She didn't speak.  She kept a large and battered skilletin her hand most of the time... Then when I woke up and knew that I wasgoing to live, the hut, the bed and the woman were gone.  I lay onfronds near the river.  I was dizzy with fever, even when I becamestronger, and I staggered blindly for days, until I stumbled into thatpool there.  I nearly drowned.  I put my head on a submerged tussock sothat my nose just stuck out of the water.   "Then I look up, and guess who is looking down at me!  And the restyou saw with your own eyes.  Who is she?"   "This," said Sam indignantly, "is Spiegel, nicknamed Gulible.  Shewas convinced by Bilbo Baggins when she was little that she was fatand ugly.  She's been an anorexic ever since."  Spiegel looked atBoromir with shy yet gleaming eyes.  "And that Frodo didn't help mucheither!"  Boromir looked at her with sudden sympathy.   "Ugly?  You're not ugly!"   "Yess..."  There was a hesitant note in the thin girl's voice.   "Come on, girl.  I'm partial to men myself, and shall not deny it;but I know when a woman is pretty and when she is ugly.  And you arepretty."   The light dimmed in Spiegel's green eyes, but was not altogetherextinguished.   "Frodo was gay himself," said Sam, grabbing Frodo's camera andtearing out the film.  There was no need for it anymore.   "Was he now?" replied Boromir.  "Well, an asshole is an asshole, nomatter his taste in holes!"   Two days later they emerged from the marshes.  They were out ofhamburgers, for Boromir was a large man, recovering from a wound and anillness, and Spiegel was eating much too, ballooning out towards anormal size.  This was land that was largely controlled by Sauron (whomthey wanted to avoid), but Gondor's agents walked among theMordorian neon glitz, disguised as tourists.  They were now the enemiesof the eldest son of the Steward, and would remain so even if Aragontoppled Boromir's father from power.  Accordingly Sam and Boromir didn'tdare show themselves, but sent Spiegel to do some shopping.  Bynightfall they had a cold meal in a little dell.  The ground was coveredin more than a foot of garbage thrown by careless tourists.  After themeal they started walking towards the Gates of Mordor, brightly lit bymegawatts of neonlights.   Spiegel walked between the two men, the tall Boromir and theher-sized Sam.  She was happy.  For the first time since she was ten shesmiled and was happy.  Sam thought her dazzling.  She told them:"Between you you have cured me of my anorexia."   "Glad to hear it, dear."   "Only one thing mars my happiness.  Well, two things.  One of you isgay, and the other has a fiancée.  I can't have neither of you."  Shegiggled.   Boromir sighed.  "Well, it can't be helped.  But you are a prettygirl.  You should have your pick of men, once we are in decent lands."   "I have never been to decent lands," she replied.
  Before the next day dawned they were well into the student residentialarea of Mordor.  The old shopping and dining districts with their distinctiveurban sprawl were behind them.  Before them, darkling against pallid sky,the great dormitories reared up threateningly.  Upon the west of Mordor marched the Ethel Duwap, the Mountains of Jazzwhich Sauron had renovated in yet another of his musical "renaissances".The hobbits and Boromir observed that whom the Valar would drive mad,they indeed first destroyed.  Upon the northern border the Ered Lithography,grey and steep, gave many a geography student of Muddle-earth pause withtheir frighteningly confusing contours.  But as these ranges approached oneanother, being indeed but parts of one great wall about the gigantic parkinglots of Lithlad Station and the Mall of Gorgoroth with its factory outletsskirting the posh waterfront of Lake Nurnenshire, they swung out long armsnorthward; and between these arms was a deep defile.  This was CirithGoogol, the Mystical Pass, the entrance to the land of the Enemy.  Highcliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from its mouth were twosheer hills, black-boned and bare.  Upon them stood the Teeth of Mordor,two towers strong and tall.  In days long past, they were built by the Menof Gondor to taunt Sauron, and indeed the exterior of each was stillgraven with many mocking runes; but the strength of Gondor failed, and menslept, and their amusement parks stood empty, not least of them thisoutpost.  Then Sauron returned, and had the last laugh.  Now thetowers, which had fallen into decay, were repaired, and filled with studentsof the musical and literary arts, ceaselessly scribing and generating reamsof hackneyed tripe year upon year.  Stony-faced the dorms were, with darkwindow-holes staring north and east and west across the Googol Quad, andeach window was full of sleepless eyes.  Across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark Lord had builta rampart of stone.  In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon itsbattlements sat the laziest-looking campus security orcs that Sam couldever have imagined.  Beneath the hills on either side of the rock was avast network of underground libraries, late-night cafes, and mediocre jazzjoints.  There a host, the denizens of these caves, lurked, ready at asignal to issue forth like vast legions of undergraduates going to class.None could pass the Teeth of Mordor and not be pressed against a sheerwall of tired and very ornery people with caffeine-reddened eyes, unlessthey were summoned by Sauron, and knew the secret passwords that would openthe back gates of his land.  The two hobbits gazed at the towers, the wall, and Boromir in despair.Even from a distance they could see the rent-a-cops munching donuts uponthe wall, and the endless stream of muttering students streaming out of anestablishment that was labeled "JAVA" in very flowery Tengwar.  Winging theheavy air in a straight flight a raven, were it inclined to savor thisatmosphere of despondency, would have flown but a furlong from theirhiding-place to the black summit of the nearer dorm.  Day came, and the fallow sun blinked over the almost artificial-lookingridges of Ered Lithography.  Then suddenly the peal of an enormouscarillion was heard, calling the student body of the University of NorthernMordor to arise.  This was followed by the cry of brazen-throated trumpetsfrom a hundred classrooms across campus not fifteen minutes later.  Anotherdreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor, and the day students,sleep-deprived and fell, were marching to their morning classes.  The steelof their bicycles gleamed dimly on the battlements.  "Well, here we are!" said Sam.  "Here's the Gate, and it looks to me as ifthat's about as far as we are ever going to get.  My word, but the Gafferwould have an endless stream of abuse to heap upon me if he saw me now!Often said I was dumber than a post and the dirt it was planted in, he did.But now I don't suppose I'll ever see dear old Dad again.  He'll miss hischance of You worthless idiot, if you had HALF your wits you could atleast live up to your name... Call yourself a WORKER?  You're a disgraceto the Cause!  But he could go on ragging on me as long as he'd gotbreath, if only I could see his drug-addled face again.  "I suppose it's no good asking 'what way do we go now?'  We can't go nofurther - unless we want to ask the Orcs for directions."  "No, no!" shrieked Spiegel.  "No use.  Can't ask fat cops for directions,they is useless, they is.  Spiegel said: we'll go to the Gate, and nowwe sees.  Time to go home."  "Now wait a minute!" shouted Boromir.  "I brought us this far, and Isay we go on!"  "No you didn't!" said a voice that sounded like Sam's.  "Yes, I did!" insisted Boromir.  "We doesn't think so, preciouss.  He didn't get us through the marshes, didhe?" said Spiegel.  "Stabs nice Master and feeds him to the alligators, hedoes.  Not nice Man."  "I didn't see you complaining!" cried Boromir defensively.  "Besides,you haven't heard MY side of the story!  Frodo stabbed ME..."  "Now, see here, I know he stabbed you, and that's a fact.  But I also sawyou telling him terrible stories about how Sauron was planning to cheat himof his inheritance and overrun the Shire..." countered Sam, or so it seemed.  "He WILL overrun the Shire!  And he'll put opera houses in every town fromHobbiton to Bree!  I wouldn't put it past him to set up a branch campus ofthe Mordor Academy for the Performing Arts in Michel Delvi---"  "DAWN TAKE YOU ALL AND BE STONE TO YOU!" thundered a voice that soundedlike Gandalf's, at least to Boromir.  Truth to tell, Boromir wasreally feeling the effects of his injuries, a ride down the Anduinstrapped into a boat, and the dreadful voice of Frodo's unquiet spirit,which had haunted him since the hobbit's untimely murder and dismembermenttwo nights ago.  At this final pronouncement, Boromir could take nomore. "Frodo, come back!" he shrieked.  "A madness took me, but it haspassed! Come back!"  Finally Boromir fell prone as if indeed petrifiedby the dawn.  As Spiegel and Sam looked on in utter amaze, Frodo crept up the path andgreeted Boromir.  The dumbstruck man shrieked anew and dashed intothe defile, hollering, "I see deead people!"  The last time the hobbitsglimpsed him, he was being hounded by a detachment of fraternity typeswho had placed a large horned helmet on his head in some sort of hazingritual.  Spiegel screamed, "Wraiths!  Wraiths with hairy feet!" and began to followBoromir into the defile, but Frodo grabbed her still-emaciated wristand hauled her back by main force.  Sam cowered from Frodo's advancingform until Frodo noticed his growing fear and laughed. "What's thematter, Sam?  You look as if you've seen an invisible hobbit!"  Sam, still baffled, stumbled, "You mean you've been using IT?  To foolBoromir into thinking you... you're alive after all, then?!"  "By Eru, Spiegel, I think he's got it!" chuckled Frodo at thestill-hissing Gullible.  "But Master... how did you survive being stabbed through the heart withthat sword of Boromir's?"  "Haven't you seen how he filed that thing on a ROCK?!  That's no way totreat a sword, if you can call it that!  The thing almost bent double onthis trusty suit of mithril mail here, though I've got another scar formy trouble.  Suffice it to say that he missed any vitals."  "But how did you escape the alligators?  I saw them rolling you in theswamp..."  "Fortunately, I have some knowledge of hapkido, which the Elves callEru ex machina.  It's just a fancy term for escaping death with aneat trick, say, a Ring of Power.  The gators couldn't see me, either."  "But... but... all that red miasma that bubbled up..."  "I'm afraid that was a pack of strawberry creme-filled twinkiesweighted down with your pots, Sam.  Who would have thought thatalligators like those, eh?"  At this awful revelation, Sam drew his sword and prepared to run thebourgeois scum through in earnest, but Frodo looked so beatific havingjust returned from the dead that he through better of it.  Sam, stillabstracted and bemused, saw that all traces of the sometimes broodingyoung man he had known before were gone.  The confused nouveauriche bachelor had vanished.  Even the decadent young esquire who hadmade unwanted advances upon him in the trek through the marshes nolonger existed.  In their place stood the form of Frodo son of Drogo,the Eternal Hobbit, shimmering in the faint light of Sting.  "All right, that's enough gawking," said Frodo, breaking Sam's reverie."I told you that I purpose to enter Mordor, and I know no other way.Therefore I shall go this way.  I do not ask anyone to go with me,unless he still seeks to be rid of the Dark Tyrant."  At this Spiegelgnawed at her well-worn nails and thought of the tyrant that had ruledher every waking (and bingeing, and purging) moment since the day shehad gone fishing with her friend Schmiegel.  "No, no, master!" she wailed, pawing at Frodo, and seeming in direhunger.  "No use that way!  No use!  Don't take the Precious to Him!Stay out of Mordor!  He'll eat us all, if He gets it, eat all theworld, and vomit it up into Lake Nurnenshire.  And you'll not have apenny of your inheritance.  Keep it, nice master.  Or better yet, giveit... to old Spiegel!"  "Get out of my way, you... dame of Udun!" exploded Frodo.  Spiegelcowered now, covering her ears against the awful thunder of Frodo'svoice.  "I am commanded to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore Ishall go," said Frodo.  "Neither would I be cheated out of mybirthright," he added vigorously.  Sam said nothing.  The look on Frodo's face was enough for him; heknew better than to ever get between the Master and his money.  Wordswere useless.  Deeds, gratuitously violent ones, would see his Causethrough.  And after all he never had any real hope in the affair fromthe beginning; but being an incorrigible fanatic he had not needed hope,so long as imperialist blood was available to be shed.  But he hadstuck to his master all the way, even when he had seen him apparentlychewed to pieces by river-dwelling alligators; that strange resolve,too, was part of what made him a Gamgee.  Yes, all through the historyof the Shire and before, the Gamgees had been renowned for being rabid,seething revolutionaries who served a mean cup of tea, passionatefighters who were just earnest enough to remain loyal to the landedgentry who adopted them (and, truth to tell, just too dumb NOT to).  Gullible, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet.  She kneltat Frodo's feet, wringing her hands and shrieking several octaveshigher than the hobbits had ever heard her do.  "Not this way, master!"she pleaded.  "There is... another..." she grated.  Frodo and Sampeered at her intently.  As if releasing her last breath, she panted,"... shortcut!"  "Another shortcut!" said Frodo hopefully, looking down at Gullibleeagerly.  "By the Valar, perhaps we can get into Mordor without allthat crap Galadriel showed me in her mirror!  All that intrigue,fighting and killing - it really had me, well, blue."  "Yess!  Yess indeed!  There was another shortcut.  Spiegel found it.Let's go and see if it's still there!"  "You have not spoken of this before."  "No. Master did not ask.  Master was conservative, sedentary homebody.Speigel says to self, if Master wants to live out life in fear, lethim.  Then voice in Spiegel's head says, no, no, no, Spiegel promisednot to lead them into lethal tra-- err, wrong voice.   Voice says,even the smallest person can change the course of the future.  Spiegelwants to help."  "What a coincidence!  Galadriel said the very same thing to me!"  Sam frowned.  If he could have drawn his barrow-blade and held it toSpiegel's waifishly thin throat, pressing its point into the hollow ofher wrinkled flesh, menacing her inch by inch until she relented andexplained what she meant by "lead them into lethal tra--", he would havedone.  But Sam, remembering how Spiegel had indeed uttered these wordsin a bizarre debate with herself, found it hard to believe that anyonewith that many voices in her head could hatch a coherently treacherousplot.  At least, the Elvish-aphorism-uttering part(s) of Spiegel, whom hecalled Witty, seemed to have the bitter-spinster part(s), whom he calledBiddy, under control.  And of course, both had catastrophic eatingdisorders, severe enough to keep Witty/Biddy from getting far inMordor's college town without the Enemy's notice.  "And it's a good thing neither half of the old girl don't know what I'mtrying to get master to do," he thought.  "If she knew that I'm goingto get her Precious into the fire if it means tossing dear Mr. Frodo,kicking and screaming, into the roiling pit of molten lava with my barehands, ahem, well, she might not be so eager.  Perhaps I'll be able todistract her with a twinkie when the time comes.  It's beyond anyGamgee to come up with more than a basic tactical plan, anyhoo.  I justhope Mr. Frodo doesn't decide that he wants his inheritance more thanhe wants Sauron and the Nazdaq all dead as doornails.  He's as wise asany, or so they keep telling me, but he's a greedy son-of-a---"  "All right, Spiegel," interjected Frodo, putting an end to Sam's silentdeliberation.  "I trusted you once, and it nearly got me run throughand torn into bite-sized pieces, but anyone could have led me into thewaiting hands of a psychopathic killer.  I'm willing to call it anhonest mistake and let bygones be bygones.  Indeed it seems that I mustdo so, if I am to get my hands on the estate that Sauron's minions havepromised me.  But I warn you, Spiegel, you are in danger."  "Yes, yes, master!" said Gullible.  "Spiegel is surrounded by fattyfoods!  Her bones shake to think of the calories, but she doesn't runaway.  You will find adventure or it will find you, Spiegel's uncletold her long ago."  "I did not mean the danger that we all share," said Frodo, glancingdown at the spare tire that he had acquired since leaving Lothlorien."I mean a danger to yourself alone.  You swore a promise by that whichyou call the Precious.  Remember that!  It will hold you to it, but itwill find the most semantically perverse interpretation possible.Already you can feel word senses and speech acts being twisted.  Yourevealed yourself to me just now, foolishly."  At this Spiegel and Samwise both looked stuporously at their pants.  "No, you idiots!  Give it back... to old Spiegel, she said.  Nowthe Precious is giving back all the bad mojo that our murderous ladyfriend here has dished out over the years!  Throttled your childhoodgirlfriend, did you, Spiegel?  Was she more popular than you were?Did you think she had a shaplier figure?"  "Told you, did he?" sobbed Spiegel.  "But Gandalf never told youwhat happened to Schmiegel, did he?"  Frodo paused, momentarily confused.  "What do you mean?  He told meenough!  He told me you killed her!"  "No.  I am Schmiegel." said Spiegel simply.  "That was the nicknamethat my Grandmother gave me when I was a little girl.  One day - itwas my birthday - I was fishing in the river and dropped my pole.  Idove in after it and saw something glittering at the bottom.  I cameup with it and saw that it was a golden ring.  I-- I tried to put iton, but---"  "But you couldn't, could you?" said Sam softly.  "You see, I really was fat."  "No, you weren't, Spiegel.  The Precious was using you then, even as itis now."  "That's not true!  It can't be!  It's impossible!" cried Spiegel.  "Search your feelings... you know it to be true," countered Frodo.  "Noooooo!" shrieked Spiegel shrilly.  Then she began to weep brokenly.  "So, when Gandalf said that Spiegel killed Schmiegel..." began Sam.  "It's true - from a certain point of view," explained Frodo.  "A certain point of view?!  That wicked old dotard!  Serves him right,being dragged to a pink fluffy death in Kringle-Dum!" exclaimed Sam,looking at the wreck of a hobbit with mingled pity and abhorrence.  "We fasted, yess, we starved, but we could never get the Precious on.Schmiegel is Kuduk for 'dumpling' in our Stoor dialect, you know.Nana could never bear to call us that after we wasted away, saddam,saddam.  Tried to hang ourselves, we did.  Twice.  But rope keptbreaking.  Burned uss, it did..."  Frodo and Sam gaped in fascinated horror.  "We ran away.  Once we loved to suck eggses, but the yolks, theydisgusted us now.  The yellow face made us look fat.  The white face,too.  We hid under the earth, ate bugs and little orcses.  Then, oneday, the Precious... the Precious..."  "It fit.  It fit because it was ready to get back to its master," musedFrodo.  "But Schmiegel was long dead, wasn't she?"  "Yess, saddam, deead, dussst and ashes."  Spiegel stopped blubberingmomentarily to blow her nose.  Frodo sighed.  There was a long, awkward silence.  Then Frodo spoke againless sternly.  "Come now, Gullible or Schmiegel if you wish, tell me ofthis other shortcut, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it,enough to justify me in turning aside from my plain path.  Time isfleeting towards the appointed hour in which I must appear to claim myestate."  But Gullible was in a pitiable state, clearly traumatized by therecounting of her tale of ruin.  It was not easy to get any clearaccount out of her, amid her sniffling and squeakings, and the frequentinterruptions in which she crawled on the ground and begged them notto look at how emaciated she had become.  After a while she grew calmer,and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the roadthat turned west of Ethel Duwap, he would come in time to a crossingin a circle of trees.  On the right a road went down to Disgiliathand the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went on southwards.  "On, on, on," said Gullible. "We never went that way, but they say itgoes on a hundred leagues, until you can see the Great Water that isnever still.  There are lots of nice fishes there (mmm... seafood),and big birds eat fishes (mmm... big birds): but we never went there,alas, no!  never ate fried food.  And further still there are more lands,they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot there, and there are seldomany clouds, and the men have huge curved swords and talk funny and chopanything they doesn't recognize into bits.  We do not want to see thatland."  "What of the third turning?" asked Frodo.  "O yes, O yes, there is a third way," said Gullible.  "The old fortress,very old, very horrible now.  We used to hear tales from the South,when Schmiegel was young, long ago.  After dinner, when we sat by thebanks of the Great River and had dessert, saddam, saddam."  She beganto weep and mutter.  The hobbits rolled their eyes and waited again.  "Tales out of the South," Gullible went on again, "about the tall Mendressed in funny costumes, with their fair daughters whose eyes werethe size of teacups, and their cities with shops in every house, andthe silver crown of their King and his Magic Studio: wonderful tales.They built great parks, and one was set atop a hill shaped like somenameless animal, and its towers were silver-white, and there was agate, like all the gates of Gondor, collecting tribute from allwho would enter the gardens of the Sea-Kings.  O yes, there were manytales about the Tower of the Moonies."  "That would be Minas Ethel that Elendil the son of Isildur built," saidFrodo.  "It was Elendil who cut off the finger of the Enemy."  "Yes, He has only three on the Black Hand, but they are enough," saidGullible shuddering.  "And He hated Elendil's city."  "What does he not hate?  But they call it Minas Goofy now.  What has it todo with us?"  "Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the whitepavilions and the gate; but not nice now, not beautiful, just reallyexpensive.  He conquered it long ago.  It is a very terrible place now.They say an awful Singing King rules over it now, always singing terriblesongs about the coming of the shadow and what a small world it is after all.Often he is away, but when he returns... ohh!"  "But how will it help us to go this way?" demanded Sam.  "Surely the Enemy knows all about his own mountains?  Or has he sold them off to pay off hisdebts?" he asked sardonically.  "Speak not of which you know little," spat Spiegel with surprisingvehemence.  "He has many debts, not the least of which he owes to thosewho would take more than his pinky in recompense."  Frodo and Sam raisedtheir eyebrows at each other.  "Spiegel helps again, though hobbits are bitter and sarcastic.She found it.  She knows it."  "What did you find?" asked Frodo.  Gullible crouched down and her voice sank to a whisper again."A little path leading up on a 15-degree incline into the mountains; thenan 85-degree turn, then a stair, 2 fathoms wide with each step 17 inchesdeep and high, then a tunnel 3.25 fathoms in diameter and 1.211 furlongs inlength, barely illuminated at either end on nights when the moon is gibbouswaxing or fuller; and at last a little cleft, in which one human or a dwarfand a hobbit can stand shoulder-to-shoulder, connecting into a path 200 feetabout the main pass.  Got that?"  "Hold on, I'm still writing," said Sam distractedly.  "Is it not guarded?" asked Frodo sternly.  "And did you escape out ofthe darkness, Spiegel?  Were you not rather permitted to depart, withthe Enemy's sorcerous tools of map-making in hand?  That is at leastwhat Aragon thought, who found you by the Dead Marshes with that crystalaround your neck."  "It's a lie!" hissed Gullible, and a wry look came into her eyes at thename of Aragon.  "He lied on me, that fat, henpecked weed-smoker did.I did escape, all by my poor self.  And I took that crystal from somedead elf in the marshes.  Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious,and I have searched and searched, of course I have.  But not for theBlack One.  The Precious was ours, it was mine I tell you.  I didescape."  Frodo and Sam exchanged glances again.  "Denial."  "I ask you again," Frodo said.  "is this secret way guarded?"  Gullible stared at the hobbits with a resentful look.  "Is it not guarded?  Is it kindasorta guarded?"  "Yes, yes, perhaps.  No safe places in this country," said Gulliblewith an impetuous pout that recalled Arwen in one of her "moods".  They could not get her to say more.  The name of the perilous placeand the high pass she could not tell, or would not.  Its name was Cirith Googol, a name of dreadful rumour.  Aragon couldperhaps have told them its name and significance, being well acquaintedwith webs of ill repute.  But they were alone, and Aragon was smokingsome of the Shire's finest far away, and Gandalf stood amid the ruin ofIsengard and strove with Aruman, delayed by the unraveling of whatseemed to all onlookers to be a hideously complex plot.  Yet even ashe hurled Aruman down to his doom, his thought was ever upon Frodo andSamwise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope andpity...  Frodo sat on the ground, pondering anxiously all that Gandalf,Galadriel, and El Rond had said to him.  Here he was a little halflingfrom the Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet contryside, expected toremember his middle school Geography and World Cultures classes.  Itwas an evil fate.  The day drew on.  A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow wherethey lay.  Not even an eagle poised against the sun would have markedthe hobbits sitting there, silent and unmoving, in their thin greycloaks.  For a moment he might have paused to consider Gullible - thereperhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of Men - before herecalled that he was not a scavenger and moved on to stoop on some niceGondorian cattle.  Frodo's head was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with handsbehind his head, staring out of his hood at the empty sky.  At leastfor a long while it was empty.  Then presently Sam thought he saw a darkbird-like figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and thenwheel again.  Two more followed, then a fourth.  The first three seemedto be trying to impress the fourth with aerobatic maneuvers.  A warningfear gripped Sam's vitals as he had felt in the presence of the BlackRiders, a feeling quite different from the apprehension the Fellowshiphad felt on the night that Lego-lass had shot some flying creature outof the night sky.  Sam took a deep breath.  "The Riders are about again, up in the air,"he said in a hoarse whisper.  "I saw then.  Do you think they could seeus?"  "According to Galadriel, no," replied Frodo, "but she also said I shouldstay away from 20-foot-long giant spiders.  I'm not sure she's jugglingwith all three Silmarils, if you know what I mean."  Sam suppressed his momentary hilarity to prick his keen hobbit ears ata new sound.  Singing and hoarse shouting came from the distance, butthey could hear it drawing nearer.  The fear of armed soldiers sent tocapture them hurled the travellers out of their languorous state.Frodo and Sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths.  Flight wasimpossible.  Gullible rose slowly and crawled to the lip of the hollow.  Verycautiously she peered over the rim.  She drew back and whispered, "MoreMen going to Mordor.  Dark faces.  We have not seen Men like thisbefore, no, Spiegel has not.  They are fierce.  They have black eyes,and long black hair, and gold rings in their ears, and noses, andeyebrows, and navels, yes, lots of beautiful gold.  And some havered paint on their cheeks, and red cloaks, and red kilts, and theirflags are red, and the tips of their spears..."  "Wait, are you sure these are men?" interrupted Sam.  Gullible gave him a sardonic look.  "We can tells better than you can,we thinks."  "Well, were there any oliphaunts?" asked Sam, forgetting his fear inhis eagerness for news of the strange and sensational like many of hisdescendants after him.  "No, no oliphaunts.  What are oliphaunts?" said Gullible.  Sam stood up, resting his right elbow in the palm of his left hand andstroking his chin (as he always did when 'trying to look somewhateducated'), and began:        Grey as a louse,        Big as a house,        Nose like a snake,        A big mess I make,        As I poop on the grass;        Young trees do I bash.        With horns in my mouth        I dance in the South,        Flapping big ears.        Beyond count of years        I stump round and round        I do not like my father Ham        My family life's a great big sham        My Master's head I'd gladly wham        I do not like him, Sam I am.        If ever you met me        You'd best not forget me        'Cause I'd stomp you flat        If you said I look fat        Old Oliphaunt am I,        Believe it, or die.  "That," said Sam, when he had finished reciting, "that's a rhyme we have inthe Shire."  "We can tell, Precious," answered Spiegel.
  As they waited for night to fall they rested, moving to the bottom ofthe hollow to avoid the light of the setting sun.  The three hobbitsremained silent as evening deepened and lights began to spring on inthe dorms and all-night cafes.  As darkness grew in the hollow, Samgot out the last of Spiegel's groceries and began making dinner. "I've got no POTS to fix anything fancy," he said pointedly, "but tocelebrate your return, sir, I'll add a little something special to ourmeal."  Soon, he was putting the finishing touches on three large hamand cheese sandwiches.  Just at that moment, Spiegel gave a yelp and leapt away from Sam withher eyes fixed on the lip of the hollow above him.  A dark form couldbe seen there, looming against the emerging stars.  Frodo felt a queerand curiously pleasant sense of deja vu at the sight, and he lay backon the ground expectantly.  Sam, who was closer, could make out a manin oddly archaic robes and holding some dark object in his hands.  Ina trembling voice he asked, "Who's there?"  The man took a step forward, and then began to strum on the guitar heheld and sing in a melancholy voice:   I am Feanor's boy, and my story's dark and cold,   I have squandered my resistance,   For a pocket full of marbles such are Silmarils   Made in the West.   Morgoth stole them from my father   And hacked up Grandpa's breast.   Mmmm-mm-mmmmm...   When I left my home to go cross the sea,   I was no more than a boy   in a company of warriors.   Standing by my father I an awful oath declared.   We needed boats,   so we asked our shoreland cousins if they'd help but they said no;   it was then we knew that they would have to go.  At this point, the man seemed to lose control of himself.  He whippedout a sword and began stabbing and slashing in every direction as iffighting an imagined horde of foes in a berserk rage, singing:   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die die-die-die-die die!   Regaining control, the singer began to strum his guitar again andcontinued:   As the war went on for ages, Beren took a Silmaril home,   to win Thingol's daughter.   When they died their son refused to give us back the jewel.   We marched in there   Killing men and helpless children 'cause their lord was so unfair.   Die-die die-die die, die die die die...  Although he twitched a few times as he finished the verse, themusician managed to simply play on without singing for a few minutes,gazing sadly off into space.  Suddenly, the rage came upon him again,and he once again began leaping to and fro with his sword, to therefrain:   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die die-die-die-die die! Again the madness passed, and he went on:   Now I'm chasing down these refugees and wishing for the stone:   Father's stone.   But the poor exiles don't do a thing but bleed on me...   Speeding free... father's stone.   In the clearing stands a jewel-box and two fighters holding blades   And we slay them for the treasures   That cost every love and life we had   but burned us 'til we cried out   In our anger and our shame,   "I am leaving, too much grieving," but the minstrel still remains.   Mmmm-mm-mmmmm...   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die    Die-die-die-die die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  ...  This final chorus involved the most intense leaping and slashingyet, and rather than calming down the singer seemed to get more andmore vicious and excited as he sang on.  And as Frodo, Sam, andSpiegel watched, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a momenton the brink of the hill, and with a yell came tumbling down straightinto the middle of Sam's cooking supplies.  All was suddenly silent.  After a few moments, a groan came from the heap at the bottom of thehill.  Sam, who had just gathered up his cooking gear and had begun tocreep forward to retrieve the sandwiches, leapt back to safety withFrodo, while Spiegel cowered among the packs across the hollow.  Asthe figure rose, Sam saw that it was not a man at all but an Elf, withdark hair and a hungry look in his eye.  "Wow!  Sandwiches!" exclaimed the Elf, and before they couldsay another word he had started to wolf down the nearest one.  "You haveno idea how good this tastes," he said a few minutes later.  "How didyou come by this Elvish mustard so near the gates of Mordor?"  Sam blushed and hung his head, but he found that he could not liewhile he was held by the singer's searching gaze.  "I stole a bitbefore we left Lorien, begging your pardon, sir.  I meant no harm, onmy honor!  I just have no use for trees."  The singer laughed.  "Oh, don't worry about it.  Nobody shouldkeep Elvish mustard from a true Sandwich Artist like yourself.  Did youknow that the secret of its making was taught to the Elves by Lavannaherself?  It's made from the seeds of special mustard plants broughtout of the West from the Blessed Realm.  I should tell you, though,that never before have strangers tasted the condiments of our ownpeople.  Come to think of it, you still haven't, have you?"  Grinning he reached over and began to eat the second sandwich whilethe hobbits looked on with increasing longing.  "You know what wouldgo really well with this?" asked the singer.  "A good margarita,that's what."  Frodo's eyes suddenly brightened.  "Margarita?  Do you knowEl Rond, then?  Do you come from Rivendell?"  Memories of the fairElf-maidens in Rivendell began to surface in Frodo's mind, and he somehowfound himself forgetting the deep attraction for Sam that had been growingon him for the past few weeks.  Now those Elf-maidens, they were goodcompany indeed... what could have made him forget the joy that he hadfelt in the arms of young Findu-lass?  But Frodo turned his attentionback to the minstrel as he replied.  "El Rond?  Rivendell?  Those names certainly don't sound familiar." The Elf seemed to be lost in some fair memory for a time, and then heexplained, "No, margaritas are an old family recipe, invented by myfather in the wild days of his youth.  We passed it on secretly,father to son, but my family has dwindled over time: we never had muchof an opportunity to raise children.  I myself only taught the recipeto my foster son Othar, but he and I lost touch quite some time ago."  Sam felt a tug at his memory at that, but he was more interested inother things.  "But who are you?" he asked.  The Elf once again began to sing:   I am Feanor's boy, and my story's dark and cold...  "Ach, no!" cried Spiegel.  "Please, spare Spiegel's ears!  Alreadywe puts up with hour after miserable hour of recording and re-recordingand hearing that same music over and over.  If we has to listen tothat song again, divorce you we will!"  Everyone else turned to stare confusedly at Spiegel.  "What do youmean, 'divorce you'?" asked Frodo.  "Sorry," replied Spiegel.  "I don't know what came over me.  Spiegelfelt like she was speaking the words of a distant voice from anotherworld.  Just don't sing song again and it might go away."  Sam turned back to the singer.  "Let me put this another way: what isyour name?"  "Oh, my name is Maglor," he answered.  "Maglor!" exclaimed Frodo.  "Feenamint's son Maglor?  But whatwere all those strange names in your song?"  "Strange names?  Ah, right, you're used to hearing the Gnomishnames.  You see, when my people left the Blessed Realm, we had a bitof a falling out.  Some of us took boats straight across the sea,while the rest decided to walk all the way back to Middle-earth.  Theyhad to hike all the way north to the great mountain Stardock to getaround the sea, of course, and what's more they had to climb straightover her.  All the way up her bare, wind-scoured west wall, across theTresses, down the Ladder, and across to Obelisk Polaris they went, andthen they somehow contrived to lower the whole troop down its sheersides.  With so many women and children along, you can imagine thattheir losses were heavy indeed."  Sam seemed puzzled.  "If it was so dangerous, and they had women andchildren with them, then it don't make much sense for them not to takethe boats, and you can't deny it."  Maglor seemed distinctly uncomfortable, and was quite relieved whenFrodo broke in to repeat his question.  "But what about the names? And what do you mean by Gnomish?"  "Oh, didn't you know?  Whole cities of Ice Gnomes live up there, inthe caves of Stardock.  The Elves who crossed her became great friendsof the Gnomes, and even adopted parts of their language into theirown.  Some of the Elves even decided to stay there with them anddecorate their mountaintop homes with the gems and treasures they hadbrought from the West.  At any rate, once the rest of us got backtogether here in Middle-earth, their language caught on, and trueProto-Elvish is rarely heard anymore."  With that, Maglor grabbed thelast of the sandwiches and began munching on it contentedly.  The last light of day had long since vanished and the moon was sinkingas Sam, Frodo, and Spiegel began to gather the bags for the next stageof their journey.  Maglor lay on the other side of the hollow, gazingup at the stars and humming to himself.  Sam wasn't at all sure howmuch to trust him after the madness of his song, but he hoped thatsoon they would be safely away: the Elf hadn't stirred since hefinished the last of the sandwiches well over an hour before.  To Sam's dismay, however, the Elf soon sat up and took note of theirpreparations.  "Frodo," he called, "what is the relic of power thatyou bear?  It seems to have a deep hold on you."  Frodo spun round to face Maglor in surprise.  "What do you know ofthe ri-, er, relic?"  "Little is hidden from these eyes, Frodo.  Those who have lived in theBlessed Realm lead a strange dual life, living at once in theNeighborhood of the Seen and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe. Whatever it is that you carry, it casts a great shadow in the unseenland.  I myself carried a thing of Power for a time, and I know whatits effects can be.  Does your burden toy with you as mine toyed withme?"  "What do you mean, toy with me?" asked Frodo.  "Did you, too, beginto see your own burden in your dreams as an ever growing wheel of fire,inescapably engulfing all other thoughts and memories until it aloneoccupied your thought?"  "No, can't help you there," replied Maglor, "but it sure playedhavoc with my sex life.  One minute I found myself longing for thecompany of women, the next for men, and back again without even amoment's warning.   It was interesting for a while, but eventually thething just got out of control.  It sometimes went for years at a timefilling me with burning desire but never allowing me to followthrough.  I finally got rid of my treasure after it drove me to spenda desperate but fruitless week snorkeling and looking for amiablebluefish."  "You know," mused Frodo, "that sounds disturbingly familiar."  AsSam and Spiegel stared at him, he hurriedly added, "all but the fish,of course," and concentrated intently on his shoelaces.  "You really ought to get rid of the thing," Maglor suggested.  "Mybrother had good luck dumping his in a pit of molten rock.  Well, notsuch good luck, actually, but at least it didn't bother him anymore. I hear there's a good sized volcano over in Gorgoroth that might dothe trick.  Incidentally, where are we going?"  Inwardly, Sam groaned, and he glanced nervously over at Spiegel tosee if she had made the connection.  It was bad enough that this foolof an Elf was inviting himself into their group, but if he managed toclue Spiegel in to the danger to her Precious there would be realtrouble.  As she began to speak, he reached for his sword, but inrelief he realized that she was still miraculously oblivious to theirplans.  "Master plans to enter Mordor," Spiegel said.  "We takes him downalong mountains, walks many days, gets good exercise.  Take secretshortcut into Black Land, yes, so master isn't taken straight to Him."  "That sounds like quite a hike.  Why not just go through the dorms?"Maglor asked.  "Security is remarkably lax.  I should know: I used tobe a music professor here.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken, some ofthese nearer corridors lead straight from the coffee shops and jazzclubs here to Durthang House on the far side of the mountains.  Itshouldn't be a bad trip at all, and you might even be able to pinchyourselves some bicycles once you get to the other side."  The hobbitsall saw the sense in this, and soon they finished packing their bagsand crept toward the darkness of Mordor.  It was deepest midnight by the time they reached the mouth of thecorridor that Maglor said would lead them to Durthang House, but theircare had paid off, for they had successfully avoided all of thesecurity orcs on the way.  Sam eagerly ran towards the opening, butjust as he was about to pass into it he felt a shock: as if he had runinto some invisible wall.  They all looked about, and there within theshadow of the doorway they saw the Two Watchers.  They were terrible figures standing on either side of the path, filledwith hidden menace.  Each of their faces had a terrible, vulture-likebeak, and their outstretched clawlike hands seemed to tear up at thevery sky, while their feet ended in grasping talons.  The thingsseemed to be carved out of huge blocks of pale white stone, but whereeach of the them seemed to hold in its left foot the body of asuffering enemy the talons were painted red as freshly spilled blood. Red as blood, too, was a single claw on the right hand of each beast,as if they had plunged their razor sharp thumbs into their foes insome dark ritual of torture, and those claws were held just beyond theWatchers' noses while their forked outstretched tongues stretched tocatch the dripping blood.  The lethal right foot of each monsterstretched its talons toward the open door as if to ward off all whodared approach their domain, and the few lights from outside glintedoff of crowns set of their brows that appeared to be made of thegilded bones of human fingers.  For all that they were made of stone,the monsters seemed aware: some dreadful spirit of evil vigilancestared out through their cruel eyes, which were fixed with fearsomeintensity upon their bloody claws.  As if to show that they carednothing for their own pain, each creature was piercing its own leftthumb with the smallest, needle-sharp claw of its opposing hand, andslashes along their chests showed where they had cut themselves forthe sheer joy that they found in agony.  The Watchers' dark stonycapes seemed to meld into the walls, so that to enter the hallway atall seemed to place one within that awful embrace, giving up withouthope to their devouring hatred of all living things.  Frodo and Sam stared at the monstrous guardians of the passage withhorror, and even Maglor seemed taken aback by their foul visage and bythe strange barrier that had prevented Sam from penetrating beyondthem into the corridor.  At that moment, they heard Spiegel cry outfrom beyond the statue on the left.  "Aha!  Here's the latch!" she said, and she reappeared as she pulledopen the sliding glass door that Sam had struck like an unwary bird. Looking back at them, she called out, "You guys coming?"  They all moved forward to pass through the door, when to their horrorthey found that something was waiting for them on the other side:standing before them was a short, geriatric fellow with big eyes, acomplexion lighter than the pale Watchers', and a half eaten cave fishin his hand.  "Ach, thanks, saddam.  We couldn't find tricksyhandles in the dark, no, saddam.  Gulible will be on his way... say,now, saddam, what a tasty little dish she is, yes, and just my size. Not nassty Elvish wench, no, saddam."  Having finally noticed theattractive form of his liberator, Gulible began to paw at Spiegel andfluff her hair.  Finally, he wrapped her in a great hug, and heldtightly while she began to squirm with discomfort, not knowing whatwould make the creature stop invading her personal space.  Frodo and Sam stared at Spiegel and Gulible in complete confusion,trying to sort out who was who.  Finally, Sam could take it no more. "Here, now, leave Spiegel alone," he said, and pulled her free ofGulible's embrace.  "Who are you, anyway?"  "You knows who we is, yess, saddam.  Set nasty trips and trapsfor us, they did, as we takes little sightseeing vacation along river. Never lets us get close enough to see pretty Elf-maidens bathing, no. And when we finally gets a chance to talk to false tricksy Elfstrumpet again, does she say, 'Sorry, Gulible'?  No, she just says,'Get Orcs'.  Well, we may be slow, saddam, but we knows when enoughis enough.  We says, 'No more Elfses', and comes here to get fisssh. But now we sees pretty hobbit lass, yesss, and maybe hobbit girlsaren't so tricksy, saddam."  Sam pushed him away before he couldbegin to fluff Spiegel's hair again.  Spiegel pulled away from Gulible's reaching hands, but it was clearthat she was flattered.  "We've got the same nickname, huh?"  Frodo now turned to Spiegel, demanding, "But then who are you?"  "I'm Spiegel, same as I've always been.  What do you mean, 'who areyou'?"  "Then, you didn't bear my burden?  You aren't tied to me by a bond offate and foreshadowing stretching across hundreds of years?  Are youtelling me that we've been traveling with some random stranger we mealong the way, someone without any hidden identity that will laterprove useful or a deep symbolic reflection of my own potential doom?"  "'Fraid so," replied Spiegel.  "What kind of fairy-tale world doyou think we live in, anyway?"  Sam couldn't bear the host of contradictions that seemed to bespringing up in every direction.  "But what about the Ring, yourPrecious?  You told us all about that, and you even asked master togive it back!"  "My Precious!" cried Gulible.  "Yes, yesss, that's what we needs!  Ifthe Baggins gives back the Precious, she won't shy away, saddam. Give it back, give it back to us!"  He ran over and began to paw atFrodo's chest, until Frodo aimed a kick at him and Gulible backedaway.  "He's got your Precious, too?" Spiegel asked Gulible with growingire.  Turning back to Frodo, she went on, "And what about that oldring?  I told you, it didn't fit, so I threw it out."  Frodo felt dizzy, and leaned back against the nearest of the TwoWatchers.  Its cold stone surface pressed against his back.  "Justwhat is your Precious, Spiegel?" he asked.  "You know perfectly well what it is, you jerk.  The pretty littledress that my aunt May gave me, and that you took away just becausemy dad was a bit late with a payment to old Sharkey."  "So when you muttered 'saddam'..."  "Sorry, I couldn't quite understand you there," said Spiegel, lookinggenuinely confused.  "It sounds like you've got something caught inyour throat."  Frodo slouched in defeat.  "I hate to interrupt," said Maglor, entering the conversation for thefirst time, "but if we want to get through to Durthang House beforethe students start stirring about in the morning we should really getgoing."  The whole group shrugged, and the five of them marchedtogether into the hallway.  The tunnel seemed to have no end.  All they knew was that it was goinguphill pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of atwist and a turn or two.  There were hallways leading off to the sideevery now and then, as they knew by the glimmer of peepholes in thedoors and by the sounds of distant late-night student parties.  Maglorseemed sure of his way, so the hobbits took little notice of theseside passages, except to hurry past for fear that they would have toexplain themselves to one of the few campus security orcs whoperiodically got up enough energy to wander through the halls.  On andon they went, and up and up; and still they heard no sound of anythingexcept the occasional second-rate strumming of would-be musicians ortheir popular idols.  Maglor seemed dismayed by this at first, till itbecame too frequent to bother about.  Sam could not tell how long theykept on like that, quickly walking on, on, on until they were morethan weary.  Suddenly without any warning they heard a "meow" from just a few yardsin front of them, and a small kitten came around a corner and sat downin their path.  The group stopped, and they all held their breath withapprehension, when they heard a voice from down the adjoining hallway. It called out, "What have you found, Shiro?"  Around the corner came a young man wearing jeans and a rumpled T-shirt.  As soon as he saw Maglor and the hobbits, he gave an evillaugh.  "I haven't seen that many shocked and frightened faces sinceNickerson gave that pop quiz last fall.  Trespassing, I guess: youcertainly don't look like students."  As Maglor reached for his blade,the student reached into his own pocket and pulled out a whistle. "I'll make you a deal," he went on.  "If you follow me back to my roomand do as I say, I won't blow this emergency whistle."  Seeing thatthey had no choice, the company obeyed.  After a short walk, they were ushered into a small but brightly litdorm room.  The first thing that hit Sam's senses was the smell: atleast a dozen litter boxes were scattered about the floor, and all ofthem seemed desperately in need of attention.  Cats lounged all overthe room, some of them cute and harmless like Shiro but others nastyand brutish as they come.  As Sam took in his new surroundings, theircaptor locked the door behind them.  "Welcome to the humble abode of Tevildo Nobunaga," he said.  "I'mgoing to sleep, but your night is just beginning.  If you don't wantme to turn you over to the orcs, you'll have to clean out those litterboxes completely before I wake up, and be quiet about it!  Just tomake sure you don't try to sneak out during the night, I'm going tohave Miaowara Tomokato here guard the door."  At those words, a largeand graceful cat crossed the room and sat blocking the door, butdespite its relaxed appearance Sam could tell that it was a highlytrained fighter: it would be impossible to slip by without a fight.   Tevildo climbed into his bed and was soon breathing deeply as heslept.  Meanwhile, Maglor and the hobbits began the loathsome taskthat they had been set.  The work went slowly, and by the time an hourhad passed they had only finished cleaning the fourth box.  The catguarding the door had fallen into a doze as well, but the twitching ofhis whiskers showed that he slept lightly.  This was enough for Maglor, however.  He motioned the others to drawclose, and shared his plan.  "I have with me an ancient Elvish salvethat carries a potent enchantment of sleep and forgetfulness.  Ittakes no more than a touch for it to take effect, so as soon as theguard is asleep we must flee immediately, before any of the other catsrecognize what we're doing and alert their master."  With that, he crept toward Miaowara and drew a small box of Elvishwood out of his robes.  As he removed the lid, Sam glimpsed a 'G' runeetched in its top, and a terrible fear sprang into his mind.  In adesperate whisper Sam warned, "Don't put mustard on the cat!"  Tevildo groaned and rolled over in his sleep.  Maglor, who had pausedand half turned at the sound of Sam's whisper, snapped around to lookat their captor, and in that motion a large dollop of fine Elvishmustard fell from the box and landed with a splat on the head ofMiaowara Tomokato.  With a burst of sudden fury, the warrior cat was awake and lashing outat Maglor with all his strength.  Before the Elf could even draw hissword, Tomokato had slashed into both of his legs with razor sharpclaws while giving a loud meowing battle scream.  As Maglor leapt backto defend himself, Tevildo sat straight up in bed and gave a greatblow on his whistle, summoning campus security.  Swift escape was now their only hope, and Frodo was able to lead thehobbits around the battle to the door.  As Maglor and the warrior catcircled each other, trading feints and testing thrusts in search ofweakness, Spiegel managed to open the lock and throw open the door. The distant stomp of running orcs could be heard down the hall.  Thehobbits desperately waited for Maglor to break free of his battle sothey could flee.  Precious moments passed, and the orcs' approachbecame ever louder.  Suddenly, Tevildo's eyes widened as he stared past the combat to theopen door.  "The dorm no-pet policy!" he gasped.  "Out!  Out, all ofyou, this instant!  Miaowara, fall back!"  Before they knew what washappening, Maglor and the hobbits found themselves shoved out into thehallway as the door slammed shut and locked behind them.  Tevildo'slight went out, and the only sounds to be heard were the grunts of thesecurity orcs just around the corner.  Gulible was the first to turn and run, and the rest followed close onhis heels.  However clumsy he might have been on the riverside, heproved to have some skill in evasion, for soon the noise of thepursuing orcs grew distant and finally vanished.  Once they wereconvinced that they had outrun their hunters, the companions stoppedin a dark hallway to catch their breath and plan their next move.  Still gasping, Sam panted, "Must have... switched... boxes... whenyou... fell."  Maglor nodded, and sat down to tend to his injuredlegs.  After a few minutes, Frodo began to take control of thesituation.   "Good work, Gulible," said Frodo.  "Now, do you know the way to getback out?"  "Ach, no, saddam," he replied.  "Gulible thinks only of escapingfrom nasty cruel orcses, not about which twistings and turnings hetakes, saddam."  Frodo turned to their earlier guide.  "Maglor?  Do you know thisplace?"  "No, I have no memory of it at all," Maglor answered.  "It must be oneof the new dorms that have been 'under construction' since even beforeI taught here.  I'm afraid that means that we are closer to the way weentered than to Durthang House, but at least we can hope that there isan exit nearby that we can reach before day traps us inside."  Sam was staring at the walls in the all but nonexistent light.  "Lookhere, master," he said, grimacing at how easily the term came to hislips: that would have to change.  "It almost looks like there might bea map on this side.  Too bad there aren't emergency lights here, orsome other light for when all other lights go out."  "That's it!" cried Frodo.  "The Lady's stone!"  He quickly pulled outGaladriel's gift, but it lay dark and lifeless in his hand.  "Wasn't there something you were supposed to say, sir?" suggested Sam. "Some name or other?  Something about lumber?"  Frodo held up the stone, and said, "All the saws here!"  As it hadbefore, it glowed brightly in his hand, and the light it made revealedwhat was indeed a map, showing an exit barely over a mile away.  Italso revealed an overpowering rage in the face of Maglor.  "Mine!  That light is mine!" he yelled.  Quick as lightning, hissword was out of its scabbard and he leapt up screaming and slashingtoward Frodo and the other hobbits.  They fled down the hall towardthe exit, as they heard the crazed refrain spring up behind them:   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die-die,   Die die-die!  Die die-die die die die die    Die-die-die-die die! ...  And on it went, repeating again and again as they ran for their livesbefore the berserk madman.  They would have been caught and slain longsince, except that Maglor's longer legs had just been injured inbattle.  Even so, his greater size and strength began to tell, and Sambegan to lose hope.  Spiegel was still regaining muscle, after all,and all this running was taking its toll: she was already gasping forbreath and struggling to go on.  Sam prepared himself to turn and diefighting as a good revolutionary should.  Just at that moment, another Elf sprang out of a side passage andfloored Maglor with a right cross to the jaw.  "Gotcha again, yousecond-rate quitter!" the newcomer sneered.  At the end of theirstrength anyway, the hobbits slumped to a stop and turned to watch.  "Daeron!" exclaimed Maglor.  "How nice of you to drop by, what withyour busy solo career and all."  The two Elves eyed each other warily.  "It didn't have to be a solo career, but you just had to be a moviestar, didn't you?" Daeron parried.  "Not that I'm interested inworking with the guy who slew so many nephews and cousins of mine inDoriath."  "You weren't even there, so what do you know?" countered Maglor. "You'd already run off lonely and sobbing years and years earlier,just because you'd let some dirty Man take away your Lustianne. What were you doing all that time that was so much more important thandefending your homeland?"  "You bastard!" yelled Daeron, and soon the two were boxing back andforth across the hall.  Frodo motioned that it was time for the hobbits to make good theirescape, and Sam and the others followed toward the exit.  Just as theyjogged out of view, they heard Maglor scream out to them from thedistance, "Know this, Frodo!  I will pursue you with vengeance andhatred to the ends of the World so long as you shall keep from me thatstone that bears the light bound by my fath--", at which moment aparticularly loud thump cut his oath short.  With that, the hobbitsburst forth from the exit and found themselves at the edge of a faircountry of climbing woods and swift-falling streams, less than an hourbefore the coming of a new day.
    In the delightful new country in which they found themselves, the hobbitsthanked Eru, the Valar, and the renowned Elven-singer Daeron (of Daeron andGlorfinkel fame) that they had escaped the wrath of Maglor the Possessive.They used the few moments before the break of dawn to get away as far aspossible from the evil place. When daylight became too revealing, they founda hole in which to hide themselves. As their breathing became less uneasyFrodo turned to Sam and asked, "Well, Sam, what do you think of the Elvesnow?" in a sarcastic manner which forced Sam once again to control his Fistof Death. "I recall you were already sick of them when we were in Lorien."    "Aye, that I was," said Sam.  "But now I'd gae further an' say they're abunch o' greedy, selfish, grasping feudal anachronisms."    "Bolsheviks, I call them," said Frodo disgustedly.  Sam just smiledenigmatically.    Suddenly Frodo remembered the Stone of Galadriel, and the strange effectit had had on Maglor. He took the stone out of his pocket and looked at itas it shined on the morning sun, as if a living flame dwelled within it.    "Could it be that this is indeed one of the Slipcasts, which werethought to be lost Ages ago?", he said wondering.    "No, no! That is not what the grazy music-teacher said to us," arguedSpiegel. "He only spoke of the Light inside it, that the light belonged tohis father, or something. Besides he's soo graazy! No. Give it to us! Giveit to Spiegel. Come on! You still owe me for that dress!"    "Hey now! I got that dress fair and square," answered Frodo angrily."Besides it wouldn't fit you anyway, you fat slob!"    Spiegel flinched as if she had been hit in the face, and turned awaywith tears in her eyes. Frodo stood above her breathing heavily. Suddenlyhe felt as if a cloud had passed away from his eyes. "What did I say? OhSpiegel, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. It was the Ring, I tell you.The Ring!"    Sam looked at him and the stone he was holding. Suddenly he rememberedFrodo, as he had been in the Barrows, a small and insecure, confused littleHobbit. Borish-bourgeois yes, but that was understandable considering hisbackground. But not this monster he had become.    "Maybe not," he said. "Maybe it has not been the Ring, but that accursedstone all along, that has been twisting your mind. You saw what it did toMaglor. Think about it! All the evil things - the Boromir incident, all thatchanging of sexual preferences - have happened after Galadriel gave youthat stone."    "But why would the benevolent Galadriel have done such a thing?" Frodoasked. "Or are you suggesting that Galadriel has some kind of evil twinsister, and she gave me that stone while the real Gladdy was hidden issome dark dungeon?"    "I don't know," said Sam. "But I do know that we need somebody learnedto help us with this mystery. Somebody who has knowledge and wisdom.Somebody with good heart and sharp brains. Somebody noble, yet friendly,somebody with special - something..."    "All right, all right. Just don't start singing no matter what you do,"said Spiegel nervously.    Deciding to set their jewellery problems aside for a while, Frodo gazedat the lovely countryside, and Sam listened in delight as the birds warbledthe sweet notes of the Pastoral Symphony.    "This is the land of the Enemy?" he muttered.  "And by the way, who theblazes is leading us these days?  Between Spiegel and Gulible, I'm sairflummoxed, I are."    "We can both lead, my Precious," wheezed Gulible to Spiegel in a grotesqueattempt at seductive charm. "We goes together like a fissh and fisshbone, wedoess."    "Um, you can lead," replied Spiegel.  "I'll take up the rear." Havingsaid this she promptly moved as far away from Gulible as possible.    They walked by a babbling brook, where the frogs sang the MoonlightSonata. Presently Frodo turned to Spiegel and remarked, "I've noticedsomething odd about you, Spiegel.  From one cha... moment to the next youseem to adopt a different style of speech.  Sometimes you talk like Gulible,sometimes you talk like Yoda, sometimes you talk like the wife of a famousshire-author, whose name escapes me... Why is this?"    "In my youth, I used to channel," replied Spiegel. "In those days, Icould control my gift, because of the dress Baggins stole."  Her eyesglowed with a reddish-purple glow of resentment, before she went on.    "When he -- it -- you took the dress, I lost the ability to distinguishourselves from others, and our identity became confuzzled, my Precious. Theonly thing that can save me is pure love, but that I will not find until Imeet a handsome racially stigmatized stranger. If you would know more, crossmy palm with silver."    "No, thank you, that's enough," said Frodo, scratching his head. (Hethought he heard the strains of "The Blue Anduin Waltz" or somethingsimilar.) "And as for you, Sam," he went on. "Why have you suddenly startedspeaking in the Northfarthing dialect again?"    "I nae longer feel I hae tae deny my heritage. In solidarity with meoppressed fellow-Northfarthingers, I defy your Hobbitonish linguistichegemony," said Sam. Frodo shrugged.    Suddenly they came across a large sign, bewritten with a mysteriousscript called teuncwar.  Fortunately there was a Westron translation, whichread: "Lugburz van Beethoven Memorial Concert Hall and Opera House -- UnderConstruction" and in smaller letters, "Morgai Construction Company." Thisreminded them again of their peril, which they had nearly forgotten in theirrelief at escaping Maglor (or Muhammad Ali, as he was called in the CommonSpeech). They might have left the University of Northern Mordor behind, butthey were nonetheless in an ominously cultured land.  Once while scoutingahead Sam came upon a baritone Orc and a mezzo practising that duet fromAct I of The Balrog of Sevîl.    "I'm nae gaein' doon there," he said to the others. "Higher up for me."    Presently, they came to an end of the classical music stuff, and foundthemselves in a new, fragrant country -- almost too fragrant.  They had leftbehind the creepily harmonious lands of Dor Remi, and had entered Ethelien,formerly the garden of Gondor in the days when the White Weed was inflower. (Mayami it had been called in the Westron tongue, a name meaning"Land of the Art Deco".) Or at any rate, it had been the garden of MinasTirith University, centre of a counterculture opposed to the anti-Sauronwars.    The hippîs, as the counterculture types had called themselves, hadwanted for the people of Gondor to gather herbs and narcotics while Sauronwas gathering armies; and face his emissaries with flowers and peace signs,and offer them hashish. Or so the Gondor historians always said; what thecounterculture types would have said for themselves, no tale tells, for theStewards ruthlessly stamped them out, while taking the drug profits untothemselves. Sauron and his servants had little truck with drugs, and hadcrushed the trade.    But in this region but shortly come under the rule of the Dark Lord,the scent of a myriad intoxicants still filled the air: opium poppies, cocaplants, various breeds of cannabis, peyote cactuses, qat, heavenly blue,black lotus, several kinds of mushrooms, and other mind-altering plants.Suddenly Sam laughed, from intoxicant-induced euphoria not for jest. Then hefrowned, for narcotics were at best a product of bourgeois decadence, and atworst an evil capitalist corruption that destroyed the communities of thepoor, and with whose ravages he was only too familiar, from the drug-addledinanities of the Gaffer. From Spiegel's gasping and choking, he guessed thatshe too smelled the vapours, and did not relish them.    "Drugses," she hissed. "Nasty, uncomfortable things! Make you late fordinner."    "Morrie would love this," muttered Frodo, who unlike the others ratherenjoyed the temporary relief from his burden - two burdens actually, whichthe mind-numbing narcotics provided. He was walking in front with Guliblenow, stopping every now and then to enjoy a specially alluring scent, or tosnack an occasional mushroom.    They had travelled halfway through Ethelien when the drugs really began totake hold of them. The day was bright and warm and they had decided to restand wait for the dusk, for Gulible would not travel under the Yellow Face,since it showed up his ugliness and jeeringly rubbed in the fact that hedidn't have a chance in Angband of winning over the lovely Spiegel. So theyhad found a deep brown bed of last year's poppies and settled there.    Frodo passed out almost immediately. The fumes helped him to forget fora time a certain self-doubt that had been growing on him since the Spiegelincident. He had had relatively few misgivings about his way of life up tonow.  It had seemed right to him that, as a wealthier member of society, heshould do what he liked and let the less fortunate go hang themselves.Poverty was probably good for them, anyway.  Builds character, and all that.Besides, Cassiopeia Took looked really good in that dress (though she lookedbetter with no dress at all ... wogah ... wogah ...) But his treatment ofSpiegel had awakened him to the true turpitude of his nature, and he wasfilled with shame and self-loathing. It was true, the Phial might had beenresponsible for the worst outrages -- but had it not, in truth, brought outand exaggerated an evil which had long lay just beneath the surface? Oh, toforget, to sleep a profound, dreamless sleep without pain or regret! Frodoinhaled deeply. Ever since their departure from Lorien, he had secretlylonged to rediscover the Nirvana he had experienced there, and now that hehad found it, it was gonna take something remarkable to get him out ofthere!    Gulible was lying cowered away from the others, but the strange andinsidious fumes that surrounded their resting-place were having an effect onhim too; the fragrance of the poppies was confounding his brain, so that hecould see nought but the image of Spiegel in various provocative postures.How could he win over - if not her heart, at least her body? Suddenly he hadan epiphany; so crystal clear that it almost blinded him. Dames didn't careabout a guy's looks, as long as he was polite and considerate towardsthem! With this drug-addled insane idea in his head, he sprang up and ranaway, returning soon with arms full of flowers.    "I picked you some bosies, Ms Spiegel," he explained, handing the flowerstowards the surprised hobbit-lass.    "Why, thank you Gulible," said Spiegel, obviously pleased. She wasn'tfeeling quite herself either, and the kind gesture of the old philandereralmost brought tears to her eyes. It seemed to Gulible that his plan wasworking perfectly.    "Well, aren't you gonna eat them?" he asked. "Look! They're full of fresh,juicy maggotses..."    Ok, that didn't work, thought Gulible, running to the woods again. Maybeif I could find some frogses, eels, crickets or - Wait! Now we know what shewould like, yesss...    Sometimes later Sam woke up from an intoxicated sleep, in which he haddreamed of his beloved Rose. Red Rosie, Revolutionary Rosie, the Rose of thePeople, Rose of Solidarity. La Rosa Internationale was her name in Rohan,Róza Luxemburg in the East; to the West she went not.    But oh, how they had marched together in the Mayday parade, and how hotshe had been later, while attacking the revisionist wing in the partycentral-committee meeting... But what was this? There was his beloved Roselying right next to him! How did she get here all of a sudden?    Sam was trying to work out this problem, when another thought popped intohis delusional brains. "How thin and drawn she looks," he muttered. HisRosie had always been a sturdy lass, with broad shoulders and strong hips, amodel of a working-class heroine if anyone. "The journey has taken a lot ooto' her it seems, and that's a fact."    Spiegel didn't wake up when Sam touched gently her cheek. "Sleep, my dear.Sleep," he muttered. "I will get ye something to eat, if it's the last thingI ever do." Then he noticed something lying in the ground, next to thesleeping hobbit. Something that looked exactly like two skinned rabbits.What a stroke of luck! thought Sam. A gift from Gulible, no doubt. Well,I shall put it in good use... He discovered an abandoned Isildur-helmetlying nearby, and using that as a pot, Sam begun to cook one of hisspecialities; stewed rabbit with herbs and mushrooms.    The Shire was not exactly known for its haute cuisine; for the hobbit'sidea of the gastronomic beau idéal emphasised quantity (mostly of meat andpotatoes, cooked to be as mushy as possible) over quality.  But Sam wasaccounted a relatively good cook, for a hobbit; although cooking a meal inthe absence of his beloved pots -- which he had dumped in the Dead Marshes,where the alligators had seized them for their orchestra -- was clearlygoing to be a tall order. Soon, however, the rabbits cut up lay simmering inthe helmet-pot. Still, something was missing though. Conveniently Guliblewas wandering about aimlessly, muttering something about being abducted byspace aliens.    "Hi, there, old snuffler!" said Sam. "Your new motto's Always ready tohelp..."    "First we've heard of it, saddam," muttered Gulible.    "Shut yer mouth and bring me some herbs and mushrooms, or shall I presentthe Fist of Death on thee! And onyway, dinnae ye want to help me get foodfor the lady?"    "Have mercy!" shrieked Gulible. "We'll do anything! Get yummy food forSpiegel. Don Giovanni swears it on the Precious!"    Spiegel? puzzled Sam momentarily, before figuring that it was probablyjust another of Revolutionary Rosie's names, and returned to his pot/helmet.Soon Gulible came back with ingredients. Only now did he get close enough tosee what Sam was up to. With a thin hissing shriek he dropped his burdenand gripped Sam by the sleeve.    "Ach! Nein - halt - raus!" he cried. "No! Evil hobbit! Steals the yummiesGulible brought for Spiegel. Saddam! Don Giovanni captured two lab-ratsfor Spiegel - one was a genius the other insane. Spiegel likes rats so muchshe faints, and now hobbit tries to take the credit. Don Giovanni won't lettreacherous hobbit steal our wogah! We'll get even, precious. We have newfriends now, good friends and very strong."    With these enigmatic words he sauntered off. Suddenly Sam felt like theworld was rolling around in his eyes as he returned to his senses. Rosie wasgone and so were the rabbits, and he realised that he was boiling tworodents on a hat which had funny round ears. His head was humming andsuddenly he collapsed to the ground and lay like a dead thing. The narcoticfumes of Ethelien had defeated him.    Through the mists of his drugged sleep, Sam could see the figures of fourtall men surrounding them. He could hear their voices, but he was unable tomove or speak, or wipe the grin off his face, for that matter.    "We have found what we have found," said one men. "But what have wefound?"    "Not Orcs," said another one. "Unless UNM has lowered their standardsremarkably."    "Elves perhaps?" said the third man, dumbfully.    "Nay! Not Elves," said the fourth, tallest and also the one with thickesthair - thereby probably the chief among them. "Elves have their own dope andneed no mannish stuff to get high, or so it is said. No, these three areHobbits or Pediannath from the north, also known as halflings, halfwits,potheads, that in Rohirric are called les Américains, and in Dwarvishdamâb (singular dumb),  or to those who speak High Language: YlenSankia Priha. They are the result of a fascinating genetic experimentundertaken by Miniwethil the mouse-eared, which explains their rodent-likefeatures and intellect. I wonder whether they have retained any traditionsconcerning the Flying Mûmaks of Dumbar, which I am trying to collect for myannotated version of the 'Dumbarcalevala' or The Adventures of Väinö - theBaad Mother..."    ("Shut your mouth!" muttered one of the men.)    "They say Mini mated with one of the Corsairs of Dumbar, so some oftheir traditions could easily have passed into hobbit-lore. Fascinating,absolutely fascinating. The text, of course, inheres within thediegetico-enacting praxis... But further discussion of this problem willhave to wait. In the meantime, let us carry these three dopeheads away fromhere to sober up!"    At the tall man's command, the three others picked the hobbits up andcarried them away from the opiatic fumes, to the banks of a small stream,and poured cold water on their heads. As Sam returned to his senses, hecould see that their captors were indeed Men, even though they were wearinggreen tights. They had masks on their faces to protect them from thedangerous fumes. All were armed, except the leader, who had instead a largemagnifying glass, with which he was examining Frodo's fingers, mumblingsomething like: "Mmmm, interesting..."    "Hey! Who are you and what are you doing with that?" cried Frodo,suddenly alarmed.    The tall fluffy-haired man laughed grimly. "I am Dr. Faramir, theScientist of Gondor," he said. "And what I do, I do to preserve themight and majesty of Ye ole Gondor, and to promote the development ofscience and arts of Humanism. Gaudeamus Igitur, and all that stuff. Or asthe Philosopher-King Earwag said: With each thing, ask what is its nature,its being... Although, of course, there have been many philosophicaldebates about what 'being' is. Dasein and Vorhandenheit, ens andesse, but if I go on much longer, a lot of me will have to go in theappendices. Personally, I find Sauron's theory of the erotics of beingfascinating, but fundamentally unsound.  What do you think?"    Frodo muttered something barely audible, but Dr. Faramir blithelycontinued his disquisition. "Quid-pro-quo. I don't have to ask your name,Mr. Frodo Baggins of the Bilbohîni, since I already know about you andthe... thing you are burdened with, but I have many other questions."    "You know about his foot-fungus!?" cried Spiegel.    "You know about the One Ring of Power, which the Council of Rivendellentrusted to me, and which Boromir tried to steal so that I had tosta... escape from him and the Fellowship, which included Aragorn the Heirof Isildur, the wannabe-King of both Gondor and Arnor® and the wielderof the Broken Sword, which is now reforged and coming to Minas® Tirithas we speak!?" cried Frodo.    "Yes," replied Faramir. "I know about the foot-fungus, since it was acover-story of last September's Shire Medical Journal, with some veryelaborating pictures, provided by S. Gamgee." Dr. Faramir said nothing aboutFrodo's reference to Boromir, although his face had taken on a strangeexpression when Frodo had uttered that name, and instead continued:    "But I must admit that I had forgotten all about the Ring of Rings, afterI had my last article concerning it published. I never thought I would getto examine it any closer. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for Faramirto win this year's Morbel Prize for Science. Ha!" He stood up and seemed togrow larger above them as usual in these cases, and the magnifying glass inhis hand trembled with excitement. He began to sing: Some day my grant willcome...    Hobbits looked at him with astonishment. "You and your big mouth, Sam!"cried Frodo. "Stupid is as stupid does, Mom used to say and she was right.Another fine mess you have gotten us into!"    "What?" cried Sam in outrage. "It was you who blabbered the whole thingup, not me! Oh, old Gaffer used to say to me Whatever goes wrong, the Richwill always try to pin it on the proletarians, and right enough too!    "Now look here, Doctor-sir!" he said, turning to Faramir. "Dinnae you gopunishing servants because their master is but a fool. Slice him up if youhave to, but let us go, u-heer!"    Suddenly Dr. Faramir seemed to regain control of himself  and began tolaugh quietly. "Don't worry Sam. None of you has anything to fear from me.Science may be my passion, but I still have my ethics - although I doexperiments with lab-rats, and to pay for my studies I sell drugs inco-operation with a vile gangster known as the 'Voice', but that's anotherthing entirely."    "You sell drugs!" cried both Sam and Spiegel in unison.    "Only to Orcs and other such worthless creatures, I assure you,"answered Dr. Faramir. "Demoralisation of the Enemy has always been a partof the Gondorian Defence Strategy."    "But this is all wrong!" cried Spiegel, horrified. "We can't try todemoralize the Orcs.  Shouldn't we get to know them and try to be friendswith them instead? There is still good in them, I have felt it! Besides,they're sooo sexy! One as learned as you should know better. How can youjustify this?"    Dr. Faramir gave them a somewhat pained look, before answering: "Thereare other reasons too. As I said, the funding of all science has faced someserious budget-cuts, and when the 'Voice' came to me with a plan which wouldalso provide quite remarkable profits to my university, I really had nochoice but to accept. It's a bad business, and one unworthy of my rank, butas Aruman pointed out in The Ethics of Necessity: 'When faced with anabsence of choice, choice becomes non-choice.'"    "Who is this 'Voice' that you speak of?" asked Frodo, who thought hisservants were getting a bit too impudent, while criticising the doings ofthe upper classes.    "He will not tell us his name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,"said Dr. Faramir. "But his singing fills us all with dread. At first Ithought he was another friend of sciences, but lately I've begun to havedoubts about his motives and purposes..."    Dr. Faramir looked thoughtfully into the distance. "You have given mea lot to think of, you strange wanderers from a distant country," hecontinued. "This encounter may yet be proven useful for both of us, for Iknow much about the Rings effects on psyche, and may be able to help you,Frodo. But not now. We have business in hand. For your own safety and mine,I will leave two guards to guard you. You also need these face-masks if youwant to avoid another hallucinatory episode. We will talk more when Ireturn. If I return, that is - but I feel that I know now what I must do."    "Break a leg!" wished Sam and waved his hand.    The Hobbits sat down again, and watched the two men on guard settlingclose by. Speaking in pig-latin they discussed briefly what had becomeof Gulible, but found no answer to that. After a while Sam spoke to theguards, wanting to find out if they could be recruited to the cause ofRevolution; but they were slow and intellectually beyond such great visions.They named themselves Blacklung and Ramrod, members of Gondor's NationalGuard, and this crud was not what they had enlisted for.    "We don't usually come this far on the East-side," said Blacklung."Business has been slow ever since the Enemy took control of the bridgeheadin Disgiliath, and brought his accursed customs officials there. Today'stransaction is the biggest one the 'Voice' has managed to set up since then,but to make that happen we had to let some Southrons from South Central toget in on the deal. Curse them!"    "Yeah, curse the Southrons!" said Ramrod. "'Tis said that in days of yorethere were dealings with Harad, who provided labor for our sweatshops; butthere was never friendship. And now the drug-lords of South Central aretrying to get a piece of the action from our dealings to Mordor and eataway our profits. Alas! Such are these days that a white man can't even sellhis own dope from his own backyard, without the help of some raciallyinferior people. If only the King would return..."    "Aye!" said Blacklung. "But I wonder what the Doc is planning to do. Helooked like he had something in mind, I think. It sometimes seems he doesn'thave the kohones for this business, it sure does. But if he tries todouble-cross the 'Voice', there will be Udun to pay for us all."    After this there silence for a while, apart from the Ramrod's boombox;and the hobbits, finding the men's company incredibly boring, dozed off abit, before they were suddenly awakened by a sound like one of Gandalf'sfireworks gone wrong. They heard yells of "Duck!" and "Run for cover!" and"I ain't going back to jail!" A long, cinematic fight scene took place. Theair was full of bullets and loud coprologies. Suddenly a man fell face downright over the edge of the coca plants that served as their hiding-place. Hewore cut-off jeans and a T-shirt, the back of which was bewritten SauronRoolz, and he looked swarthy and racially stigmatized. His brown hand stillheld a rusty water-pistol. It was Sam's first sight of war between Men andMen, and he found it a nasty consequence of the deep structures ofinequality. He was glad he could not see the man's face. He wondered if hewas really evil at heart, or just a victim of societal exploitation or theproduct of a broken home, whether the presence of a positive male role-modelwould have enabled him to avoid this fate -- all in a flash of thought thatwas suddenly driven from his mind, when a loud noise broke out almost nextto him.    "Drive-by! Drive-by!" cried Ramrod. "May the Force or Valar or whateverturn him aside! Khaddy! Khaddy!"    To his amazement and dread, and everlasting joy, Sam saw an enormous shapecome charging through the hashish groves. As big as a house, much biggerthan a house he seemed to Sam's astonished eyes, and noxious fumes gushedforth from the hind portions of his anatomy. Fear and amazement, perhaps,made him appear larger to Sam than he really was; but the Khadillak of SouthCentral was indeed a car of great bulk, and such of his descendants as liveon in these latter days are but a shadow of his girth and majesty. It ispossible that the effects of the dope had not yet worn off, or perhapsbedazzlement had confounded Sam's vision; but he could have sworn that themonster's feet looked a lot like wheels. But he had little time to get acloser look, for in the driver's seat a man, who looked strangely familiar,was bombarding the countryside with an AK-47. Sam hit the dirt as thebullets ricocheted all around him; and within a moment the great beast waslost to view, still trumpeting his horns far away.    Sam gave a deep breath. "It was an Oliphaunt," he said. "So Oliphauntsexist, and I have seen one.  What a life! But no one at home will believeme, until the Revolution raises their consciousness.  Well, now I'm going totry to sleep off the effect of those cursed poppies. Don't wake me up!"    Blacklung laughed sarcastically. "Don't you halfwits ever do anything butsleep?"    "Not really," muttered Frodo, waking up for a split-second beforecollapsing.
     It seemed to Frodo that he had slept while long yearswere measured by the wheeling stars above them - but in truthonly a few hours passed before Dr. Faramir came back.In record time he had gathered many men who had come withhim; indeed the entire scientific establishment -- scientists,professors and student body -- of all the universities inEastern Gondor had seemed to gather for the occasion.They sat on the hill and grasses, in a huge amphitheatrewhile Dr. Faramir was pointing with a ruler at the standingfigures of Sam and Spiegel. It looked strangely like aclassroom's show-and-tell: and Frodo wondered why he waslet aside.     It soon became obvious that the students were notsatisfied with Dr. Faramir's account of the hobbits atseveral points: their migratory patterns, their reproductiverituals - not to mention their feeding habits and heightaverages.     "But it was at the waking of Isildur's shame that themidgets would be standing low!" a fellow Professor, DrImrahil, insisted. "If these are the so-called midgetsknown as les Américains, then they must be able toadjust their height, or at least do so since the householdof the round one. Do you deny it?"     "The Bourgeoisie indeed has a knack for greatly expandingtheir width at the workers' expense, and that's a fact. Butnot their height," spoke up Sam. We'll have to adjust itfor them, he thought. He had a vision of heads, many headsrolling, and then all the clouds parted and at his commandthe whole of the Shire became a garden of cut-off heads. Heonly had to pick up a handy axe...     But Dr. Imrahil interrupted his daydreaming. "There areother things I'd like to learn from you, for all thatconcern Isildur concern me closely and yet the matter ofIsildur's Shame still remains unresolved. Embarrasingthings Isildur did a-plenty, and knowledge of any one ofthem would not be a sign of doom. Whatever was that thingyou brought it before the council and there it was seenand Isildur's shame proven - is that no so? It is hiddenyou say, but is that not a feeble attempt at blackmail?"     "Well, now that you mention it..." answered Sam, but atDr. Faramir's look he quickly changed his answer: "Nay,it is not ours to reveal. The Shame does not belong toany mortal, and certainly not me or you; therefore youhave nothing to fear. If it can be claimed by anyone itis by Aragon, son of Arathon, son of Aradud, son ofArabarf leader of our Fellowship from Moira onwards.Your complaints to him."     "Why him, and not Dr. Faramir, head of the University ofGondor which Isildur's sons founded?"     "Because Aragon had a Veriseal-approved document -- oh,you mean the Shame. Because he claims to be descendantof Elendil, Isildur's son. And he has even had the swordof Elendil reforged and improved."     A murmur of scientific dismay ran through all the studentbody. "The sword of Elendil reforged and improved! Horrorof horrors! What will comes next? Should we install drainpipesin the Great Pyramid of Pelargir? Improve the frown of theMinnie Pizza? What a grievous loss to archaeology."     But Dr. Faramir interrupted now, and he seemed unmoved."Maybe. But the 'reforging' of such a sword could easilybe used as an excuse to remove all evidence of itsauthenticity. I suspect a case of fraud -- clear proofshall be required of this sword's origin should thisAragon come to Minas Tirith. We'll have to carbon-dateit before we decide whether we'll hang him for desecrationof one of our nation's artifacts -- or give him the chairfor heir-to-the-throne impersonation. Class dismissed!"     The students dispersed, and so did all the professors otherthan Dr. Faramir who seemed thoughtful. Frodo approached thegroup, and Sam stared defiantly at the man. "Well, are yousatisfied, Faramir? I did the best I could." he said in ahushed voice.     "Of course you did!" Dr. Faramir said and smiled. "Youare great at deception - of all sorts." He went on with asideways glance at Frodo which made Sam very uncomfortable."But you could not hide from them the fact that you threebear a burden other than Frodo's foot-fungus. The misdirectionwas necessary, I fear - and the revelation of the Sword willhelp cloak your other secrets.     "But there are other matters I want to learn from you now -which makes me happy that you have finally woken up, Frodo.You spoke of Boromir a little while ago. Were you a friendof his?"     Vividly before Frodo's mind the memory of Boromir(handsome rugged looks and all) bending over him with his vileattentions - or stabbing him with his mighty sword: and for amoment he hesitated. Dr Faramir's looks hardened. "No," Frodosighed, "and more's the pity."     "Then you wouldn't care at all if you learned that he wasgay?"     "Indeed I would no--" Frodo said and then his startledmind caught up with his (somewhat pointy) ears. "Gay?" he said."Do you mean that he is gay, and that he never cared to tellme? How do you know? Did I lose all chance to a potentialrelationship? Or are you now trying to trap me with afalsehood?"     "I would not snare even an orc-- oh, what the hell, ofcourse I would, and my colleagues and students also, if it wasfor a good cause. But I'm not lying now."     "But he never mentioned this to me. Why did he not offerhimself to me, not even when I was using my charms all overRivendell? Surely there must be a reason?"     "Or indeed many." said Dr. Faramir, "and ugliness not themost important."     Sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry atthis conversation. "Begging your pardon," he said, "but this hasgone on long enough! See here, Doctor! What are you drivingat? Has the Magic Kingdom of Gondor fallen so lowthat it need repeat the same joke over and over again? Noonecares about their sexual preferences, and that's a fact."     "Patience!" said Dr. Faramir. "Your wit may be a greaterthan that of your master, but you don't need to teach me aboutour peril: the death-blow of the lame joke. Were I as hasty asyou I'd have killed you all long ago - and then proceeded totorch down Minas Mickey and pretty much all the rest of theMagic Kingdom of Gondor as well."     Sam sat down heavily, and Dr. Faramir turned to Frodo again."You asked how I know these things. We kept little hidden fromone another. Similarity in names means kinship 'tis said. Andwe two had four letters in common: He was my brother."     A shadow of sorrow passed over his face and Sam and Spiegelexchanged looks (though Frodo remained oblivious as ever). "Weobserve, Doctor," Sam said, "that with great care you say wasand kept. What about the present tense? Do you think himdead?"     "Well, it certainly wasn't a mistake in grammar!" Dr.Faramir snapped at them, then he turned towards Frodo again. "Doyou remember anything of special mark that Boromir carried withhim?"     Frodo stuttered for a while, wondering how this interrogationwould turn. How he would fare among so many men, (oh my, how manymen!) warlike and strong, he did not know, and it filled him bothwith hope and fears of inadequacy. Yet he felt in his heart thatDr. Faramir at least was a man both less interested in sex andstraight.     "Boromir used to have a horn."     "Oh, that - yes, he used to drink from it, and its sound washis weapon of choice. I meant something else."     "A sword that he filed on rocks? A red shirt with big blackconcentric circles and an 'aim here' sign? Hair that turnedfrom black to blonde depending on the medium?"     "Yes, yes and yes." said Dr. Faramir, now becoming impatient."But, something else..."     Frodo thought deeper - and suddenly it came to him: the onething that was the symbol of the whole of Gondor; the onething which was both sewn into their flags and carved in theirtrees.     "I remember that Boromir had a trademark sign."     "You remember well, and as one who has in truth seen him,"said Faramir. "Maybe you can see it in your mind. A capital Tfollowed by a capital M, either elevated in superscript or boundin parentheses. That trademark does the ruler and heir of therealm hold for many generations now -- and it said that there'sno fan or satirist which will not quail at its use."     "But even the mightiest corporation may succumb to anamateur humorist," said Sam. "and I fear that Boromir wasstruck down by many. Yet this does not explain how you know ofhis death."     "I sat at night by the solemn waters of Anduin in the greydark under the young pale moon, evermoving stream, near therustling sad reeds; watching the anthroporphisms in the narrative.But my mask may have been flawed or the fumes thicker than usual -for I had a vision: I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a raftfloating on the water.     "An awe fell on me, for the raft seemed to defy all physicallaw in that it should sink like a stone to the bottom of theriver - and yet not only didn't it do that, but there was a mantied upon it. And then the raft turned towards me, and started tofall apart within my reach and yet I dared not touch it, lestmy hands contaminate the sample."     "The man was Boromir, my brother, and as cranky as a newlyawakened Balrog which hasn't yet drank its morning coffee. Iknew his face, his voice, his stench. One thing only was changed -for his warhorn was different and all in golden. Boromir! Icried for we never used trademarks in familiar speech. Why isthy bronze horn golden? Hast thou discovered the secrets ofalchemy? O Boromir! But he only yelled Untie me, you daydreamingfool of a brother! and he was gone... The raft moved downwardsthe stream and Boromir cried Oh, no, not another waterfalland tumbled into the turbulent waters. And I do not doubtthat if he's still alive, then he'll have to find out a prettyfar-fetched way to explain it."     "Alas!" lied Frodo, yet his smirk could not be hidden. "That wasindeed Boromir, as I knew him. Not biblically, mind you. The GoldenWarhorn of Summoning was given to him in Lothlorien by the LadyGaladriel."     "So then you passed through the Land of Lorien! Long it has lainbeyond the knowledge of all except the most experienced golf-players -and yet I suspect it plays a role in the drug operations of the Voice,or the 'Master' as he desires us to call him. Much that was strangeabout him I've slowly began to understand. That guy is NOT anincarnation of Eru!" he said, yet they perceived not his meaning.He fell silent for a long while.     "But the tale is such," Dr. Faramir said again in the end, speakingagain softly. "that it will undoubtedly fill you with grief and fear.Almost it makes me want to let you go, out of sympathy for your loss.For unless all in your party were slain or captured, how would Orcsor servant of the Nameless find the time to tie Boromir down forsuch torment? I fear that none in your company still live.     "But even though I don't yet know for sure what happened on theNorth Marsh, you, Frodo, I'm certain about. I've not earned a degreein criminal psychology for nothing! There is something about you,Frodo, a fairy air, perhaps, not that there's anything wrong aboutthat. Yet more lies hidden (and you hide more lies) in your wordsand in your possessions than I had first thought. I should injectyou with truth serum and have you strip-searched.     "But we don't have time for that here. We must move hencewithout more delay." He sprang to his feet and called for Ramrodand Blacklung. "We'll be going to a secret place that we have. It'sa beautiful place and well worthy of a visit - even though it hasfailed as a commercial venture. In the morning I will decide whatis to be done about you."     They set out at once: Ramrod and Blacklung ahead, with Frodo,Sam and Spiegel behind. While they walked, Dr. Faramir talked to themwith an even more hushed voice than earlier.     "Earlier on I was careless and repeated what in his folly Frodorevealed - in front of my soldiers to boot! That is the reason Ihad you, Sam, turn to the matter of Aragon and Isildur's Sword -which my soldiers were also bound to have noticed more. Frodois way too frank for such a job. Or stupid."     "Would it help if I say it was all a bunch of lies?" saidFrodo.     "Hah! I do not blame you for trying to cover up for yourlack of skill and wisdom in a hard matter. Yet few would instantlyrecognize the thing that you spoke of - we of the house ofthe Stewards (Steuards that was once in the ancient tongue)have much knowledge and preserve much ancient lore that even inacademic circles it isn't found. For we reckon our line toMardil the good Steuard who built our first universityonce he found the opportunity to send King Eisner away to China.And he was the last King and had no legitimate child. Analliance between the universities and the entertainmentindustry has governed the city since that day.     "And this I remember from Boromir as a boy when we werefirst taught the laws of science and of commerce -- that it alwaysdispleased him that the heads and heirs of the noble houses oughtnow to have either a trademark or a Ph.D. 'How many years needpass for a copyright to expire?' he asked. 'Seventy years afterthe author's death or a hundred after publication, for otherplaces of more reasonable laws. But for the Magic Kingdomnot even a billion trillion years would suffice.' Does that nottell you anything?"     Frodo thought. "About Gondor's practices? Yes, indeed. ButBoromir accepted Aragon's Veriseal contract."     "I don't doubt it. He obeyed the laws even when theydispleased him. But the pinch had not yet come: Aragon had nottried to trademark yet his name or create his own copyright laws.     "But once again I stray: We in the house of Denethor knowmuch in both scientific and financial matters. Books and tablets,battery-powered lanterns and swords guaranteed to break immortalwills, microscopes and nuclear generators. Few understand thesethings nowadays - alas for the lowered standards in public education.It was these things that brought the Dirty Pilgrim to us - and yethe spoke to us about other lands in the North, so far more advancedthan ours that they even have umbrellas."     Dr. Faramir sighed and his eyes took a far-away look. "What awonder these lands must be! All things must be great there, andscientists held to a great respect!"     Sam coughed nervously. "The Dirty Pilgrim?" asked Frodo. "Did hehave a name?"     "Masterly Wonderful One he wanted us to call him, " saidDr. Faramir, "or he wouldn't be content. But many are the namesthat I have been given, and even more the epithets, he said.Mesprendeur among the elves, and Wandy-elf in the Eddas; Olorinin the West in my youth best left forgotten, Mayanus in the South(which becomes Mayonnaise in the Gnomish dialect), Gandalf in theNorth, 'That Crazy Pyromaniac' in the forests--"     "I think we get the picture." said Frodo.     "-- 'Your Finger, You Fool' in the lost kingdom of Australia,and Gandolf as the rustics name me, or 'Panoramix' in the nobletongue or Olrrn?whthfckdsthtIstrthn^kheis?! to those who canpronounce somewhat the Valinorean..."     "Olrn -what?!?"     "--thfckdsthtIstrth^nkheis?! yes. It's in the Zarfian dialect.But my real name is constantly growing, for I've lived a very longtime, and my name is a story that would tell you all the things I'vedone or are planning to do and that would really inconvenience me."     "No doubt I could add to that list." growled Frodo. "Lathspell Iname him, Swindler-and-Crook. But he'll get no chance to hear it.He was lost in Moira."     "No! Fathe--uh--teacher!"     Sam and Spiegel once again exchanged looks. "'Father'?"     "No!! I never said 'father' and you can't prove I did.Fatheuhteacher means, umm... Obnoxious one in the forgottentongue of the Etruscans. Anyway, are you sure he was so thoroughlylost that he couldn't find his way back? Perhaps a search party..."     Frodo chuckled. "Thank Eru, yes. A magic-wielding character whofalls into an abyss in an ambiguous death-scene and no recovered body?Nope, we are never seeing him again."     "I see that it's a blessing that he wasn't cut in two," saidFaramir, now in greater control of himself. "This Mesprendeur was, Inow guess, more than a meddler and cow-tipper extra-ordinaire, he wasa loremaster and scientist - and you can hardly get much more of apraise than that. Had he been among us to consult concerning thehard words of our dream, he ... well, come to think of it, he wouldhave probably interpreted it as a nonsensical Freudian delusionfilled with phallic symbolism. Or we'd have quarelled about whetherit's the midget or the standing that's supposed to be low. Aye - itseems that the journey of Boromir was doomed. Mesprendeur knewhardly anything about Isildur or the events surrounding him: Geneticswas his expertise."     Now Dr. Faramir's voice sank to a whisper. "But this conclusion I'vereached, or leaped to, or somersaulted to,  and I have postponed itfor an upcoming publication: That there's physical evidence for theIsildur-Miniwethil-Sauron triangle which so far has only been rumored.But I had not before thought that Isildur's Shame was that same thing.For none of the histories - nay, not even the parodies - ever madethat connection. Not even in Dr. Imrahil's blockbusting trilogy WasIsildur gay?, Was Isildur a transvestite? and Who's this Isildurperson anyway? was that ever implied.     "What was that Thing I can't yet be certain. Was it an engagementpresent from one to the other: a piece of jewelry perhaps?" - headded with a wry smile at the hobbits. "But other reports speakof the stain of Doom that this Thing held - the stain which could notbe unmade or washed clean, save only in the Nurnenshire lake, nearthe place where it was wrought. And this implies that it wasa piece of clothing. Either way, I can believe that Boromirwould try to steal such a thing; he was a bit into crossdressing,be it rings, dresses or horned helmets.     "But fear no more! I am not such a man - and my dressing habitsare normal. No, no, I'd refuse to wear such thing, even for the sakeof scientific experimentation."     But for the sake of the Revolution, thought Sam, how manyworse things I've been willing to do. Oh, Revolutionary Rosie, forgiveme.     "For myself," said Faramir, "I would see the White Weed smokingagain all over the courts of the kings, and the Mousy Ears return,and Minas Tirith a leader in scientific achievement andentertainment: Minas Mickey again as of old, full of vision andcreativity; beautiful and expensive like a once-in-your-lifetimeexperience with wit and real humour - not a jester-for-hire with apun or fart joke, nay not even a well-intentioned clown with baggytrousers and a ready pie to throw."     Frodo made no answer. Almost he had wielded to a lusty desirefor this man of taste and scientific achievement - but something hadheld him back. He was now in a deep mistrust about the Stone ofGaladriel (or was it the Ring - a 'thing of Power' Maglorsaid) which might create in him these feelings. It didn't helpthat right now he felt himself getting turned on by visions ofclowns throwing custard pies at him.     So they passed on, until the graphic surroundings grew fewerand fewer. Then they turned aside again to the right, and camequickly to an open field, west of a white house with a boardedfront door and a small mailbox in front of it.     "Here, as was agreed, I shall blindfold the eyes of Frodo.The others may still walk free."     This was not to the liking of Frodo. "The agreement was madewithout my consent," he said. "I will not walk blindfolded, like apeasant or a servant. I am not a spy, and if I will not go forwardfree then I will go back and sue you all when I come into myinheritance as Lord of the Nurnenshire estates."     "Now that you have so far, you can't go back to where you usedto be. You are in a whole new world." said Dr. Faramir sternly."And I am either speaking metaphorically or quoting a song.Possibly both. Anyway, you will NOT come into your inheritance,not unless you claim it within ten years' time. We could keep youfor longer than that."     Frodo sprang up (a rather meaningless gesture, since he wasalready standing) and tried to set himself side by side with Sam,something which would have caused more impressive results if Samwas willing to comply or if there had been a nearby wall to placehis back against. He fumbled for Sting.     "A plague on males and their pissing contests! We don't carewhose sword is the biggest!" cried out Spiegel.     "Come!" said Sam. "It is unfair for my poor, poor Master to bethus singled out. Blindfold us all, and me first. That will be best,even though surroundings will have to be described verbally," hesaid but he winked at Dr. Faramir as he was saying it.     "So let it be done." answered Dr. Faramir, smiling. "Will youconsent to this, Frodo? Why, I will blindfold even myself and mysoldiers before leading you onwards."     Frodo reluctantly agreed, and forcing himself not to laughDr. Faramir had Blacklung blindfold Sam, Spiegel, Faramir himselfand then Frodo. Needless to say when that last blindfold was placed,all the other ones were removed.     So it was that Frodo knew nothing of that last mile of the road.They descended through caves, and a maze of twisty little passages,all alike. Now and again they'd have to backtrack their steps oreven drop objects so as to have reference points in their effortsnot to get lost. In places the passages seemed to have a weird logicof their own, so that reversing your direction wasn't certain toreturn you to your point of origin. It all looked very tedious andtiring to Sam, even though it filled him with a strange sense ofnostalgia.     "Let Frodo... uh, I mean us see!" Dr. Faramir said in theend. Frodo's scarf was removed and he stared around him. They werestanding on a wet floor of polished stone, on which a window wasset, open, one pane laid back.     "This is the Henneth Annun, the West Under the Window,",explained Faramir. "One of the most experimental of our places.Few strangers even know about it. Don't mind the name. It'sintentional."     They climbed down and at once the found themselves in a roomwith a table set for two (two hundred that is), lit by candlelight."Well, here is our refuge," said Dr. Faramir. "Not a typical place,but here at least you may pass the night. Only two reactions there areever concerning it: One either loves or hates it. And understandingis not required for either."     Dr Faramir bid them rest, then he went about among the men,questioning each as they came in. Some were coming back fromtheir SATs, but others had been sent to record the fauna in the landsbordering with Mordor.     "Well, Anblorb, did you have a chance to study the specimen youwere seeking in its native environment? Before dissecting it, thatis?"     "Well, no, Doc," said the young man. "It didn't seem of the orcusgenus at least. But I did see something rather strange. It wasgetting dark, so perhaps it was nothing other than a grue or aNorseman."     Sam pricked up his ears at this.     "Yet if it was a grue, it was also horned. It stood man-high andseemed to walk as if it knew our secret ways. Perhaps under theshadow of the Unnamed Travesty some of the Norsemen of Holywoodare wandering in our newsgroup. They have horned helmets there,'tis said."     "Perhaps," said Dr. Faramir, hesitating briefly. "That could be aomen of both ill and good. An influx of newbies can be a good thing,but not everyone would welcome it. What did you do?"     "I followed standard procedure," said Anblorb, beaming. "Shotit dead. It screamed and then fell into the waters and flowed away."Sam gasped then, and Dr. Faramir gave him a swift glance - but Samsaid nothing. He struggled with himself. "Boromir may not be allright," he thought, "and then again he may be. I have a feelingthat he may still have a part to play before all this is over. Dr.Faramir did tell me that Boromir's Gnomish name was 'McCloud'after all."     After supper (and before they ate they had all stood silentlyfor a moment in respect for the One Who Was, and the One Who Is,and the One Who Will One Day Perhaps Be) Dr. Faramir asked themmany questions about their journey. Much he dwelt on the subjectof Tom Bombadildo, but eventually he returned to the place ofBoromir in the fellowship and the role he'd played in withthe Reeps in the wild, with the bureaucracy of Charadhras, inthe mines of Moira.     "It must have irked Boromir to flee from such an obviousplace of both entertainment and commercial profit."     "He was the last to go," said Frodo, "but the room had becomefilled with enflamed posts. If it hadn't been for that, I do notdoubt that both Aragon and Lego-lass would have remained theredebating the subject."     "Maybe it would have been better if he had perished there,rather than meet the torment that awaited him in the hands of orcs."     "Maybe! Which reminds me, how about those Nicks?" said Frodo,trying to quickly change the subject. "Umm, because the sports of MinasTirith interest me a lot, that is."     "How about them? Interest for sports is waning in Minas Tirith.The sword of Elendil, if it returns indeed, may briefly rekindle itperhaps, if its bearer has not only inherited the blade, but alsothe will to fight for his life against the lions and tigers of thearena we'll put him in.     "Boredom was ever present in the realms that the Atlanteansfounded. Kings used to sat lazily in front of non-existent anduninvented television sets, or considered a game of scrabble moreinteresting than the process of reproduction. And the birth-rateswere declining.     "But the stewards were wiser and much more liberal in theirbeginning. Liberal because they recruited the breeding-stock of thesturdy folk of the havens, and invited the sexy peoples of the Northover, which being white were considered almost human, unlike the menof warmer climates. (And thence does Dr. Imrahil derive hisancestry - the teen pregnancy of an elven exchange-student.)     "So it came to pass in the days of Cirion, the TwelfthSteuard (and my father is the 1075th - don't ask, there were someperiods of very abrupt changes in management) that the Rohirrim mencame over and wooed our womenfolk, while the Rohirrim women tried torape our men. And these all became our brothers and sisters-in-law,and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need with sexual adviceand better cuisine.     "And even the most bigoted among us loved them, for their womenwere fair and their men were fair, and their speech was likewisefair, and a great number of the children born to our women werefair in the following years. And the bigoted among us had noproblem with that.     "For in such a way did Gondor like to divide the human species,forcing everyone to register as one of nine different 'races' based onthe hue of the skin, with the whitest us on the top. Feh!" Dr. Faramirspat on the ground. "Scientifically absurd!" he said, and then suddenlysighed and was quiet.     Sam was suddenly willing to take whatever information he hadoffered to share with them at face value. He had noted that Dr. Faramirseemed egalitarian-minded, and this had earned his respect and quietedhis suspicion even more than their mutual dislike of Frodo had. He spokeup. "You haven't told us much yet about the Ring, Doctor."     "Sam!" cried Frodo aghast. He had fallen asleep yet again, and heonly woke up for these last few words. All three turned towardshim, surprised.     "What?" he asked. "He knows about the ring. You told him yesterday,remember?"     Frodo looked embarrased. "Umm... I had forgotten, actually. Sorry."     Spiegel rolled her eyes. "Save us! There again you go! You'd forgetyour own head if it wasn't screwed on, as my grandma used to say.O dear, oh dear!"     Dr. Faramir smiled at Spiegel and then turned back to Sam. "Indeednot, Master Samwise. I thought to leave it for the next cha-- that is,for later. And I'd like to know what other people told you aboutit. Lady Galadriel, for example! Wise she must be, and perilouslybeautiful!"     Sam shrugged. "Well...I don't know anything about perilous.She may be her own evil twin sister, but she probably makes herpartners use a condom."     They spoke for a little while more and then they finally stood upto go to sleep. "I'll have thinking to do," said Dr. Faramir. "Papersto grade, and my instruments to set up for tomorrow. Go now to rest,therefore, but first tell me if you wish where you are planningto go and what do do you want?" A shadow seemed to pass overhim as he spoke those last few words, but it may have just beena trick of the candlelight's flickering.     Spiegel's eyes glowed eerily and for a moment her hair stoodon edge. "You want to know what I want? You want to know the truth?I want my people to reclaim their rightful place in Middle-Earth.I want everything to be as they used to be!" she growled, thenshe suddenly stood straight and passed her hand over her eyes."Oops. Sorry. It seems I was channelling for a moment there. Idon't even know where that stuff came from."     Sam wanted many things, several of which had to do with theblissful swing of an axe, but he refrained to speak of this beforeso many witnesses.     And as for Frodo, he suddenly burst into tears. "I just want toget my estates and title!" he whined in a weak voice. "But that blastedEl Rond forced me to first find Mount Viagra and throw the Ringinto the gulf of Freud. They all said so. Why does no one care tohelp me?"     Dr. Faramir stared at him in grave astonishment, then as Frodoswayed, he stepped back and let Frodo fall into the muddy floor."Throw the ring into Mount Viagra? What an amazingly stupid thing todo," he thought, and directed servants to pick up Frodo and throw himinto a spare dungeon.     For Sam and Spiegel better accomodations would be found. "Goodnight, Doctor. You are enjoying this, aren't you?" he asked, indicatingthe unconscious Frodo being carried away.     "Am I?"     "Yes, sir, and I don't blame you."     Faramir smiled. "Perhaps. Your begin to see with eyes keener thanthose of many who would deem themselves wise. My ethics can indeedget a bit weaker when dealing with the foolish. The desire to do as Idid was overpowering."     "Ah, well." said Sam. "As I said, I don't blame you. Butsomething else..." he added and his mouth turned into a strange smile."You said my master has a fairy air and that was true even if soundingvaguely homophobic. But I can say this: You have an air (and a nose,and eyes actually), that reminds of, of - well, a wizard. OfGandalf."     "No, you are mistaken, it's a trick of a light, it is!" criedout Faramir. "Have I not earnestly studied the matter? Wizards can'treproduce. And there's no evidence that Gandalf learned ways toexperiment with genetics in Dol Guldur, none whatsover, none I tellyou! Evil cannot create! Not that Gandalf was evil! Goodnight!"     He ran away in an uncharacteristic near-panic and Sam was leftwith his thoughts. "Well, Doctor seems a decent equal-minded sort andGandalf is dead, but there's nothing wrong with gathering a little dirton people... Just in case. Perhaps I can from afar discern theopportunity for blackmail." he mused, pleased with himself.     The window shattered.
        Frodo woke to find Dr Faramir bending over him. For a second a ray ofhope seized him, and he felt his stomach muscles contracting.        "There is nothing to be happy for," said Dr Faramir. "I definitelyfeel nothing for you."        Frodo's hopes vanished.        "Wake up, you fool," said Dr Faramir and hit him in the back witha rubber stethoscope. "Sam, your entrusted servant, thinks that youshould have your part in the deeds that will follow. I would have gladlylet you rot in this spare dungeon in the depths of our beloved University,but Sam convinced me that you could make for an interesting experimentalsubject. Move!"        Frodo searched for his trusted sword, but that must have beenremoved from him while he was asleep. It seemed to him also that the dungeonhad been redecorated slightly while he slept, and now had mood-lighting,a plush purple throw-rug and garish upholstery. But Dr Faramir remainedstanding impassive before him, and two of his lab-assistants stood near thedoor with great cattle-prods. Taking the hint Frodo walked quietly to thedoor, taking pains not to make any sudden movements. He was thankful to Samfor having the idea of getting him out of that stinky (was that patchoulioil?) basement Faramir was pompously caling his "dungeon".        They climbed through anonymous corridors, lighted here and there byold blacklight bulbs. In the end they reached something that looked liked aclosed balcony, suspended over a large hall. Some of Dr Faramir's men werestationed along the walls, looking out through narrow embrasures at somesight outside. Bad mood music (reminiscent of the mighty wails of theElven-queen Janis, yet canned and distilled like something meant forold men in a seedy public-house) was playing from some unknown source, andmulticoloured posters trumpeted the achievements of the doors and somesort of airplane. Dr Faramir stood beneath a mirror-ball and the starsof Gondor wheeled and spun above his head.        "Tonight, Lieutenant, we have a mystery to solve," he saidmelodramatically.        Frodo went to one of the embrasures and peered out. Outside weregrey peaks in a rough semicircle, which Frodo thought were the peaks of theEthel Duwap until he saw they were made of broken concrete. Some old PeterMax posters had once been affixed to the broken walls in a pathetic andunsuccessful effort to make the space look friendly. Their peeling edges nowshone faintly green and grey from accumulated mildew. Frodo thought he couldsee the moon over Gondor peeking over one of the cracked walls; yet it wasonly the glare of an old quartz/halogen light, such as were fashionedby the Velour in the early days of Arda when work-lights were scarce, andFrodo was simply too uninterested to make the distinction.        Far below, in a rough concrete pool, dirty water was swirling menacingly.        "What is she, Anblorb?" asked Dr Faramir to a man standing in a higher position, looking down with a spyglass. "Is she a bimbo, as we have not seen in years? Is she one of those feminist activists we ushered out decades ago? Is she a female at all?"        "'Tis not a bimbo, whatever else it be," answered Anblorb. "It hasicky feet and dives manwise. Not that it show too much skill, though; in factit is quite inept." And he grinned. "I think she is unaware of our presence. Ihave a bow here - " here he grinned and pointed towards a huge, menacing siege-crossbow mounted on a nearby trolley - "and I have other men with similar weaponsof mass destruction posted around the entrances. We are just waiting for yourorder to proceed, Doctor. One word from you and we can unleash enough weaponryto completely obliterate our own fortress." And he grinned again.        Frodo wondered what were they talking about. He looked down again butcould see nothing. Looking again from a different embrasure, however, he saw askinny body moving slowly by the pool's edge. The thing, wrapped in an old towel,was cautiously trying the cold water in the pool with one long toe.        "Should we fire our shots at her?" asked Dr Faramir, looking at Frodo."It is for you to decide. I am pursuing a psychological experiment here and, yes,you are a part of it. Feel free to decide. You have grown thinking each human being is different and that we all should be treated with the respect that isshown to a unique being-"        "I never once thought anything of the kind," Frodo snapped, insulted bysuch a plebian attitude.        "Anyway, what is it?" Dr Faramir continued. "Is it a spy, or a snack, orsome new species of crustachean? Is it a female? Would it be interested in goingto the prom? I've got a tuxedo," he preened proudly. To Frodo's eyes Dr Faramirseemed younger than before, much younger, and his hair seemed slicked back in astrange new manner. "But if she won't go to the prom with me," he continuedangrily, "I'll blow the entire fortress right out the bottom of our Flat Earth!It'll be China Syndrome right through the back of the turtle! I've had enough andI'm not going to take any more!-"        "I'd go to the Prom with you," Frodo said hopefully.        "Ask her!" Dr Faramir continued, unhearing. "Ask her! If she says yea,I'll buy you a soda, or something. If she says nay, however..." Here the Doc-tor's countenance grew fierce. His skin turned red and the Brylcreem on top ofhis head began to smoke. Horns began showing from the top of his head. "If shesays nay, then I'll blow this entire soliloquy apart! Bang go the bandagesand the trestles! There'll be a smoking hole left where the high school used tobe! My wrath shall be one with the Way of the Albatross!" Frodo looked at DrFaramir's wild eyes and foaming mouth and stepped back in amaze.        "Go!" Faramir continued. "Ask her. But if you dare return without herankle-bracelet, the very fires of Doom shall be unleashed upon you, upon her,upon us all! Go! And spare not the '55 Chevy, which my ancestors held in greatesteem in days of old. Go!"        Anblorb grabbed the small hobbit and, holding him by the neck like acat, moved quickly along a dark passage. In time and after much stumbling theyreached an airlock, inexplicably marked NO SNORKELS, where the vicious guardthrew Frodo in through the first door, slammed it and spun the wheel. Frodocould hear water splashing outside the door opposite. A man dressed in anacademic's robe was hidden in the dark, trembling of cold. When he saw Frodohis grim face changed to a hopeful one, but after getting a better look at thehobbit he went grim once more and returned into the dark corner. Frodo stooddumbly for a long moment until the academic reemerged, pointedly gestured atthe wheel in the second door, and again withdrew. Finally Frodo took thewheel - it seemed icy and menacing to the touch - and gave it a good spin; andthen another spin, and still another. It felt good. He could have spun thewheel in his hands all day.        Just as Frodo was beginning to really enjoy it, though, the wheelsuddenly stopped with a disheartening splglunk and the airlock doorslowly creaked open on its hinges - loud, squeaking, portentious melodramatichinges. With a sigh of disappointment (and a curious guilty feeling that he had,somehow, already failed, and a suspicion he was being laughed at), Frodo wentthrough the airlock and crawled down the long narrow tunnel leading down intothe cave.        Frodo looked around. There were only the gray walls all around, and therush of water from some great fissure above into the pool before him. The posterson the walls looked even worse when viewed more closely. Nothing indicated thepresence of the observation room suspended above, beyond the southwest wall.        He crawled towards the edge of the pool. At first he could not hearanything above the rush of the falling water, but as his ears adjusted he wasable to notice words near the water's edge.        "Ssssss! Ayyyy. Hushhh. Darn cold water! How is poor Gulibbl supposedto eat fishess and prawnss? No romantic dinner with poor Spiegel, noo, noteven the candles stay lit in this misst. Not likely to get a table in thiss,even with a reservation. Ssssss! Tricksy hobbits, they woo Spiegel, theyinsults her, yes, insults her, with their bad-tempered remarks and bourgeoisiestandards, and Gullible never getss her away for ten minutes, no, not evenfor a quick tryst-"        "Gulible," Frodo said quietly.        Gulible stood abrubtly, dropping a handful of lace doilies. They felldirectly into the water. "Sssss!" the creature hissed. "Baggins! Filthybastard! All day I've been working on those."        "Gullible," Frodo said again, trying an alternate spelling. "You mustlisten to me. You're in terrible danger."        "Ssstupid part to be cast in. Talks to my agent, I will," Gulible spat.        "You're in terrible danger," Frodo needlessly repeated, hoping toavoid a non sequitir reply this time. "Dr Faramir's watching us. He'sgoing to blow up the whole world and kill us all unless we appease him!"        "Mother," Gulible said inexplicably.        Frodo reeled. The single word stung him like a knife. He felt himselfsinking, sinking into a quagmire of itchy coddling. I never knew my mother,Frodo thought to himself. Though I heard rumours. They said it was a boatingaccident. They said Bilbo had an alibi. They said she was a party animal. Theysaid I'd never amount to anything. They said I had a small member. Well, I'llshow them. He turned on Gulible. "It's a lie!" he shouted. "I've always beenvery proud of my body!"        "Mother," Gulible muttered again. "She always liked me better. Anyonewho could wear pants. And now you want to get anything that isn't her, jusst toshow her. You basstard! This whole conversation is simply fraught with meta-phorical significance."        "I don't understand," Frodo said plaintively, echoing the sentiments ofmost of the readers.        At this Gulible turned away. Frodo imagined himself climbing a longpole, or maybe a trout, which was equally insensible but served to get him outof this odd state of literary symbolism he had found himself in. He hardenedhis will, took a deep breath, and stepped towards Gulible with colddetermination in his eyes. "Gulible," he ordered, "put on that dress."        "Ssssss?" Gulible hissed eloquently.        Frodo pointed. A rack full of dresses were just off to one side. "Puton that dress," he commanded, his hand reaching for the Ring. "That one. Thewhite cotton top and red plaid skirt. And the shoes and bobbysox. Be quick!Faramir wants to dance!"        Gulible seemed utterly confused, not least of all by the rack ofdresses. "Bobbobbysssocksess?" he hissed. "Sssss! Noooo! They hurts thefeet! Itches, itchessss! Nasssty Elven sox!"        "Yes, the sox," Frodo commanded, feeling the command of the Ring athis beck. "And the ankle bracelet. And the charms. I hear Dr Faramir's gota '55 Chevy."        "Ssssss. Oh. Well, that makes it all different," Gulible said quietly,reaching for the skirt. Maybe there would be a drive-in, or a milkshake. Thepathetic creature surveyed the dress-rack for a moment. "What about underwear?"Gulible asked, rooting about for a pair.        "You probably won't need any," Frodo replied.        After a time Frodo took Gulible's hand, and he led the period-costumedgangrel creature back through the double doors and into the observation room."Well, here she is," he said to Dr Faramir, proferring Gulible's slimy littlehand to him. "But no parking lots, and be sure to have her back beforemidnight."        "My dear Frodo! You did it!" Dr Faramir shouted.        And then suddenly the lights came up, and Frodo realized the room wasfilled with people. They cheered him and wrung his hand. Gulible was shovedrudely out of the way as a thing of no consequence. Dr Faramir strode up tohim and began speaking loudly. "I knew you would pass the test," he grinned."I just knew you had it in you. And now all of Gondor is here to receiveyour commands."        "My - my commands?" Frodo gasped.        "Yes, my Lord," Faramir fawned. "Even for the ruling classes of Gondor,before one can come into power one must pass the great Test of Leadership®. Soit has been for untold generations of our people. And by commanding this uglylittle creature to do your bidding - " he gestured quickly over towards Gulible,who was sitting in a chair kicking his heels and looking put-upon - "you havepassed our Test®, and become the Ruler of our great people. Nay, even aYardstick! Praise Him With Great Praise!"        And all the host cheered and threw confetti and water balloons, andFrodo looked out at the awestruck unwashed masses and realized deep in hisheart that he really was meant by Divine Providence to lead them all;and the feeling was powerful and strangely erotic.        Just then the crowd parted and Sauron came forth - Sauron, the EvilOne, with three heads and only one Eye, five hands and only nine fingers, anda three-piece suit with only one tie - Sauron came in and bowed before him."I hereby abjure of all my Evil Deeds," he said slowly, "and I really feel badabout everything. I am your love-slave. You can keep the Ring if you want. Idon't need it any more."        "Uh, thanks," Frodo said, then answered more expansively. "Fill out anemployment application and take a number. Have some hors d'ouevres; they'reon the little table back there."        Sauron slunk away, and Gandalf stepped in to fill the void. "Frodo,my lad!" he grinned. "About time you made it here. I sent a Candygram off tothe Lords of the West. They should be here in an hour or so to bow beforeyou, if the lights aren't against them. Excellent job, Frodo m'lad! Excellentjob."        "You can go back to cleaning latrines now," Frodo said dismissively.        "Right, I was just getting back to that," Gandalf replied. He hastenedout of the way just as Dr Faramir hustled back in, along with Boromir and agiant rat. Frodo began to panic just as Boromir spoke.        "Nay! Nay, mighty Frodo, do not be alarmed; for I am here as yourvassal, and acknowledge that you have always had the right to slay me or treatme as you will. I seek not revenge. For that is not my purpose here, nor ofanything but to this purpose: You are now to be Mighty Lord of Gondor,and now we shall have your Coronation!"        Frodo felt an almost orgasmic buildup of happiness and power. WithFaramir kneeling on one side of his chair and Boromir upon the other, heimagined his life as it was to be henceforward: kingly, and royal, and holdingall of the Western lands beneath his mighty fist. And with these two mightyvirile men at either hand, eager to obey his every whim! Behind him the giantsix-foot smiling Rat lifted up the Mouse-ears, the symbols of Kingly Might inGondor, and slowly, gently placed them upon Frodo's kingly and noble head.        Frodo smiled beneficently upon the crowds, then glanced for a briefmoment at his twin vassals before looking up for the champagne - then did adouble-take as he saw the braziers full of red-hot coals. "Uh, what the hell arethese for?" he snapped, partly irritated and partly scared.        "The rivets," Boromir replied. "To hold the Crown on your magnificenthead. Forever."        Frodo opened his mouth to object, but just then there was a searingburning sensation from his right temple! The first rivet was in! He began tocry out when the Rat hit the rivet with a hammer, a ball-peen hammer whichreverberated in Frodo's skull! Before he could object the second and thirdrivets were placed, and though he tried to scream the Rat smilingly went onwith its work, pounding, pounding, pounding, the mouse-ears welded toFrodo's head, with no chance of escape...
  Much to his surprise, Frodo found himself sitting on the cave in hisbedplace. Quickly he felt on his head and sighed with relief. The mouse-earswere gone. Thank Eru, it was all a dream. He looked around and noticed Samand Spiegel sleeping peacefully nearby. Either that or the whole thingneeded some serious rewriting, he decided and returned to the realms ofIrmo. Soon, however, the hobbits were woken up, and led to a table where foodwas set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them, and there was someconfusion of who was to be left without a seat until Frodo got the messagethat his presence was not desired and returned to his bed.  When they had finished, they stood up. "A word of warning for you two,"said Dr Faramir. "Beware Frodo son of Bilbo. He has done murder-death-killbefore, or at least tried to; and his uncontrollable urges may lead you intothe world of trouble yet."  "Yet we must go with him, at least for a while," replied Sam. "Because ofthe agreement we have made. He's still the boss, or so he must think, untilthe time is right. And he wants to go to Mordor."  "Then you must go right now," said Dr Faramir. "The land is empty ofdrug-dealers, and the 'Voice' is hiding somewhere, licking his wounds. Butmy scouts who have crept within sight of Morannon bring strange news. Allis quiet in the nameless land. The choir-practices have ceased, and theclass-trips have been cancelled. A waiting silence broods there, and I knownot what this portends. Perhaps Sauron is planning nothing more but anotherwalking-concert, and yet I fear that the time of some great conclusion drawsnear. For it is only Gondor which stands between him and the greatRenaissance of Middle-Earth, and if she falls, then light entertainment maycompletely disappear from the western lands."  Before seeing them off, Dr Faramir gave the hobbits some provisions. "TheMordorians have weird tastes in cuisine," he said, "and I am stronglyopposed to experimentation in an uncontrolled setting. In addition, I wouldgive you these gifts."  To Sam he gave a small laboratory kit and a lab-book, that he mightcontinue experimenting on Frodo during their journey.  To Spiegel he gave abottle of medicine to help her controlling her channelling problem, and toFrodo a copy of Playtark, that he might behold the beautiful blondestherein, and be cured.  (Actually, Frodo was already beginning to changesexual identities again. The good news is that he had the hots for femalesagain. The bad news is that these females were mostly fishes.)  "I can nay offer you any more help," he said to Frodo. "Unless you arewilling to come with me to Minas Tirith, where we have the bestlab-equipment money can buy. Then I could also examine your foot-fungus, andperhaps develop a powerful biological weapon to use against the Enemy out ofit. Won't you come?"  Frodo felt tempted to surrender himself completely to the skilful hands ofthis grave young doctor, whose words seemed so wise and fair. But he washeld back, by his dreams of the great catfishes, which he had heard livingin the muddy banks of the lake Nurnenshire - wogah, wogah! He lifted hishead and noticed how the others were looking at him strangely, and realisedthat he had spoken his inner monologue out loud.  There was no need for more words. Frodo was again blindfolded and DrFaramir took them to the edge of the forest. He bid farewell to Sam andSpiegel, after the manner of his people, and then disappeared into the woodswith winged speed, leaving the two hobbits spitting and wiping their mouths.Frodo removed his blindfold with haste, and stood blinking his eyes in themorning sun, gazing around and looking a bit silly.  "Is it secret? Is it safe?" he screamed out.  "What on Arda are you talking about?" asked Sam. "The Ring sure as Udunisn't a secret, 'cause you spilled your guts about it the first chance yougot!"  "No I didn't!" said Frodo.  "You so did too!" said Sam. "Lucky thing you didn't get a chance toreveal that you also have Isildur's Shame in your possessions. Now let'smove on!"  Then there was lots of marching...  Presently they came to a crowded intersection, which had been closed offfrom traffic.  An enormous sign said "Google Junction"; for they were cometo a strip that Google (also called The Evil One) had seized from Sauron inexchange for paying off his debts.  He had proceeded to develop it in recordtime, until it resembled Rockville Pike, without the local colour.  Most ofthe inhabitants were tourists who gave a new meaning to the phrase "UglyGondorian". A small, decrepit figure was making a vain attempt toproposition all the females. On noticing the hobbits, he gave a start ofrecognition.  "Spiegel, my preciousssss!" he hissed. "Are you still with the nasty meanhobbits?"  "Yes, though my heart yearns to once again see the familiar pillars on thedoors of Tara, where my roots are. After all, tomorrow is another day!"replied Spiegel and quickly took a zip from the medicine-bottle given by DrFaramir.  "Have no fear! Don Giovanni'll protect you, yes he will," promised Gulible(for he it was).  "And where have you been all this time?" interrupted Sam. "Plotting somenasty and unnecessary sub-plots, no doubt!" Sam took a quick look at Frodoto see what he thought about the obviously guilty face Gulible was making,but Frodo seemed to be deep in thoughts.  Now that they had reached the crossroads, Frodo felt that he had came tothe point of no return. Once again he felt a strong urge to drop everythingand head straight to Gondor. He thought about long hours alone with DrFaramir, being examined by his strong, yet tender hands, and felt hisexcitement arousing. Then he thought of the slimy fishes of lake Nurnenshireand felt even more aroused. "You're tearing me apart!" he cried in hisdespair.  "I need a drink!" said Sam.  The hobbits went into a bar and ordered some expensive lutefizz (a localbeverage -- don't ask) and proceeded to get roaring drunk. Sam had rarelymade such an impassioned revolutionary speech in his life. Unfortunately, noone could remember any of it thereafter. The next thing they knew, they werehandcuffed and were being held by Google's private security guards.  "We're gonna take you to Gondor to stand trial," said one. "But firstya gotta come with us to the concert, cuz that's where we're going so youare too."  "Its a fair cop," said Sam.  They crossed the street and found themselves in a kind of outdoor concerthall thingy. However annoyed at being stuck with these scuzzy securityguards, they could at least take consolation at being in the FIRST ROW.First row, imagine that! But when the musicians came out, Sam and Frodowere shocked to their cohones.  "Holy Plutocracy, its the Nazdaq!" whispered Frodo, lifting his cuffedhands to cover his face. "This is the end of the road, the end of the road!"The crowd roared its enthusiasm as the nine caballeros sang an eldritchchant:        Hey, hey, we're the Nazdaq;        people say we nazdaq around,        but we're too busy huntin'        and chasiin' all the gals in Khand.        We're just tryin' to be deadly,        come and watch us ambuscade;        we're the wraith generation,        and we can't wait to get laid.  They missed the rest, because one of the security guards was munchingdoritos rather loudly and sloppily, and the crumbs were getting all overSpiegel.  At last she could stand no more and slapped the bastard in themazoolah. In the ensuing confusion the hobbits slipped away, running asif the horror that impelled their being were indeed the west wind madevisible -- or something along those lines.  Presently (sigh) they found themselves in a plaza, at the centre of whichthere stood a statue, redolent of ye olde Gondor. Tall was he, and hewore a yellow shirt and a black vest, and long, pointed shoes. His head hadbeen knocked off and replaced by an Orkish head with wacky hair; but hisbearing was still regal. Beneath his feet was carven the name "Wupdidu",which was crossed out and replaced with "Moe Zart". Nearby lay his head,which was long-nosed with a black round thingy at the end; half-closed werehis eyes, long his ears, and tall his blue black-banded hat, adorned withtwo lumps on top.  Sam muttered something about oppressors; but his heart misgave him, for hefelt some strange bond with the droopy-eared king. Frodo was disdainful:"Good riddance to bad rubbish! Those kings were overrated anyway." Spiegelsaw in the king's long snout a symbol of phallic oppression, and Guliblekept his political opinions to himself, if he had any.  If only had there been a suitable beam of sunlight shining on thedecapitated head Frodo could have possibly found encouragement from thesight, but there was no such luck.
  Sam looked at Frodo's dejected back. He saw that the situation called forextreme remedies. Nimbly, he removed a little bottle from the lab kit givenhim by Dr Faramir. With the ease of an experienced cook and master poisoner,he made a ham sandwich and let some drops from the bottle fall on it.  "Oh, Master Frodo!" he called. "Here's a little morsel to put you in abetter mood."  Frodo stared suspiciously at the sandwich. Then, as the magic of thesandwich worked upon him, his face changed and he wolfed it down as if hehad not seen any food for days.  "What are you doing?" murmured Spiegel in Sam's ear. He gave a her acrooked grin.  "That cordial on the sandwich will give our little weakling somewell-needed energy," he said. "He'll just fly the rest of the way, andthat's a fact!"  Spiegel opened her eyes very wide and stared at Frodo. "I believe you,"she choked. Sam followed her gaze and cried out. Frodo seemed to be swayingwith the wind where he stood. His feet left the ground, and he began to movein little circles, like a stray balloon. At the very moment when Sam, with ahoarse cry, leapt to pin him to the ground, he left it for good and sailedskywards with a hissing, very balloon-like sound. He gazed down at Sam andSpiegel with eyes the size of beef tomatoes before a cold wind came from theeast and blew him in the wrong direction - towards the Great River.  As Frodo scudded westwards, Sam and Spiegel sprinted after him so as notto lose sight of him. The grotesque spectacle went on for hours: Frodojerking and bobbing in the wind and the other two running after him,stumbling and cursing. Sam's language reached positively Trotskyite levelsof vituperation. The sun was already nearing the horizon when Frodo floatedinto the ancient ruined city of Disgiliath, followed by his wheezing,panting attendants. There the magical potion, satisfied with its work, letgo of him with a loud bang and he dropped to the ground, rolled over and laystill. Sam and Spiegel ran up to him, panting, and lay down on top of him.  Frodo never knew how long it was before he woke up from an evil dream andfound that reality was worse. Sam lay straight across his chest, making ithard for him to breathe, and on top of that, one of his hairy feet waspressed against Frodo's mouth. This was not the kind of kinky sex heliked! (Besides, his ichtyoerotic personality change was still progressing;even in his half-stifled condition, his loins ached with lust for big, slimyfish to straddle.)  "Sam, you addle-pated fool, get off me!" he cried.  "Oho, THAT's a new tune from you!" growled Sam, but obliged. He andSpiegel got to their feet and studied the surroundings.  They were in the centre of the old commercial district of Disgiliath. Shopwindows and malls were all around them. In the centre of the square whereFrodo had fallen down, there was a statue of a strange being with huge roundears, an insane grin, fourfingered hands in white gloves and red shorts withbig yellow buttons. But the vulgarity of the men from Westernesse had beenaugmented by the vulgarity of the Men from the East. Everywhere around themthere was evidence of their dread presence: the stench of filthy tennisshoes from an uncovered pit, the inscription MARMADÚKH IS A WANKER scrawledon a wall, an old school tie twisted like a rope around the throat of thestatue with the big round ears and a whole row of punting-boats tied to thejetty on the nearby River.  Frodo sat up. Staggering, he got to his feet. He took a few steps, pickedup a loose paving stone and sent it crashing through the window of a shopnearby.  "Master Frodo, art thee mazed?" cried Sam, shocked out of his class-conscious diction straight back to the forelock-tugging language of hisancestors.  "No, you idiot," grunted Frodo and reeled into the shop. Sam looked closerat it and realized that it was a drink shop. They heard a clinking soundfrom inside, and then Frodo returned, carrying eight bottles of WestfarthingChinook.  "They are still well-stocked after all these years," he puffed as he sankto the ground. With a greedy gleam in his eyes, he stowed seven of thebottles into his knapsack before opening the last and taking a deep swig.  "Is this really the right moment to get drunk?" inquired Spiegel icily.  "Yes," replied Frodo simply. Since there was not really much one could sayto that Sam and Spiegel fell silent, watching how Frodo knocked them backuntil the booze made him talkative.  "Do you see that other shop?" he asked, nodding to indicate the object ofhis conversation. They looked at a little shop with a bow window and a signabove which announced, in faded gold letters: "Aruman's Tattoo Parlour".  "Aruman was not always evil," hiccoughed Frodo. "My fa... Bilbo told methat he began his career as an honest shopkeeper. He did piercing as well astattooing, and the cowboys from the Pelennor Fields used to go there to gettheir hats surgically removed."  "Interesting," remarked Spiegel. "I have thought of getting my nosepierced, but I'm so fat it would simply make me look even more like a cow."  "It's bulls that have rings in their noses, you twit," sneered Frodohaughtily. Sam bristled.  "Who are you to speak to her like that, Stinky?" he demanded. Frodo gapedstupidly at him and emitted a loud burp. Menacingly, Sam took a stepforward. However, at that very moment there was the sound of someonestrumming a guitar behind them, and then a well-known voice burst intodreaded song:          I'm an Elven bard and I'm OK,          I sing all night and I sleep all day.They all looked at Maglor's detested figure. Frodo, who seemed to sober upconsiderably at the sight, muttered in the high-elven speech: "A galaxy wentout on the hour of our meeting."  Undeterred, Maglor threw back his head and sang:          I sang of beer, of lots of beer, and lots of beer there flowed:          Of peanuts and of pretzel bags, and boy, the goodies showed.          We drank a toast, a second toast, the foam was on our ale,          and some took bitter, others stout, and one or two chose pale.          And there beyond the counter stood a barmaid plump and fair;          The glow from our reefers shone like torches in her hair.          Oh, Ivy Bush! Beloved pub! When will we meet again,          When will I gaze with love again at every beery stain?          Oh, Ivy Bush! Too long I dwelt upon this Hither Shore          And drank inferior brands of ale and stared upon the floor.          But even travelling steerage I could not escape my curse:          Where are the tickets cheap enough to suit my meagre purse?There was silence. No one wanted to applaud for fear of encouraging Maglor.With feigned absent-mindedness, Frodo stared at the River. Suddenly, hearose with a cry.  "Beloved! Precious!" he shouted. He started to run towards the River. Witha curse Sam tried to grab his arm and stop him, but was too late.  In the River, a beautiful mermaid yoohooed at Frodo, stroking her hair andmerrily slapping her fishtail against the water. Frodo was filled witherotic madness. THIS was what he always had desired! He took a flying leapinto the water and began to swim towards her with great strokes of his arms.  "Come back, Master Frodo!" screamed Sam. In an attempt to turn him back tohis old fixations, he whined: "Oh Frodo, me dear, me dear! Come back!" butto no avail.  "STOP him!" howled Spiegel.  "OK," sad Maglor. He stooped, grabbed a cobble-stone and threw it atFrodo's head, scoring a bull's eye. With a last, despairing precious he sankbeneath the waves.  The mermaid stared at them with big, frightened eyes. Sam looked at Maglorwith disgust.  "Brilliant!" he commented. "Any other great ideas?"
       Twilight began to fall like a really slow boulder.  Sam sat onthe cobblestones outside the Siege Weapons Of The Future display,smoking his pipe and idly looking in the windows at a greasy, obsoleteprototype of the Trebuchet of Tomorrow.  Spiegel leaned against thewall nearby, staring blankly at the red of the setting sun.  Maglor,who had been mistuning his guitar for a horrifying quarter hour, wastrying to unbend a fret he had bent in a particulary unsuccessfulGb7 chord.       When they had run down to the riverbanks the mermaid, who uponcloser inspection turned out to be a suckerfish with two prominentgills, had squeaked in terror and swam off to have another go atevolution elsewhere.  No sign of Frodo could be found.  Sam didsucceed in recovering Frodo's waterlogged pack.  It still held theirprovisions, their beer-money, some grotesque silicone-rubber toyswhich Sam dared not identify, and a small assortment of stolen cutleryfrom Dr Faramir's caves.  Yet no sign of the Ring or of the waterproofpacket which held the Deed to Nurnenshire could be found.       No sign of the Shiny Thing of Galadriel could be found either."That bastard!" Maglor had shouted at the water, hitting the riverangrily with his guitar.  "That drooler!  That cat-loving thief!"After an hour or so he calmed down somewhat and dealt with his griefby writing a song.  To the horror of the hobbits he insisted onsinging it all afternoon over and over:       Are you going to drown under there       Pervert thief hairfooted and short       I don't see how I'll find the slipca-ast       Hobbit was my final resortLate in the day Maglor finally stopped to eat, though he hummed amedley of old Morris dance tunes during dinner which put Sam andSpiegel right off their food.       Now it was early evening.  Sam stretched.  "Well, guess that'sthe end of the ol' Quest then," he said simply.  "If Frodo's dead andthe Ring gone, I guess there's nothing to do but go back to the Shireand light a few rich people's mansions on fire, as me Gaffer alwayssaid we ought to have done.  What about you, Spiegel?"       Spiegel looked at Sam.  Her thumb was deep in her mouth andher eyes were glazed in thought.  "Now that Baggins is dead," shereplied slowly, "my lifetime of seeking terrible revenge and livingin horrible self-loathing has reached its fruition.  So I guess I'llgo find a good therapist."       "I think," said Maglor, though nobody had asked him, "I thinkI'll wander by the shores of Lower Middle Earth for the rest of time,singing plaintively about my loss."       "Good idea," said Sam, who lived inland.       "At least until a profitable music recording industry isinvented," Maglor added.       "Perhaps you should get started, then," Sam said flatly,gesturing down the River.  "The Sea's down that way."       "Don't let us keep you," Spiegel added quickly.       "Uh, okay," Maglor replied.  Then he added, "But you've bothbeen so nice and we've been through a lot together.  I thought maybebefore I go I could make a ballad about you.  The Ballad Of Sam AndSpiegel-"       "No, that's okay," Sam said hastily.       "We don't need one," Spiegel jumped.       "No room in our packs for a ballad anyway-" Sam shouted.  Butit was too late.  Maglor began to sing:       Gamgee had come down from the Shire       To light up Frodo's funeral pyre       You knew his old head was       Just full of revenge       So he took his Master off to the East -Christ!" he finished suddenly, as Sam threw a cobblestone at his head.       "Shut it and be off with you!"       "You know it ain't easy," Maglor continued, trying to stayon the beat.  "You know how hard it can be."       "One more note and I stick my finger down my own throat,"Spiegel added, with the horrible tone of one who has successfullydone it before.       Maglor turned away, hoisting his guitar over his shoulder."The way that we're goin'," he said, "I'd better leave for the Sea." And with two more codas he wandered away towards the South grumblingabout how much easier it was to get gigs during the Kin-strife.       Sam slept soundly.  He dreamed of Frodo flailing about in theriver.  In the dream Frodo kept yelling to Sam for help.  Sam, standingon a pier five feet away holding a life-preserver, just laughed andlaughed.  The life-preserver was marked LUSITANIA, after the Elvenqueenof old.  Frodo's pack was full of cement blocks which Sam had tossedin at the beginning of their adventures.  Rosie appeared on the nextdock along with a cheering crowd.  She took off her dress and beganwaving it at him seductively.  Sam waded past the screaming Frodo totouch her.  She casually threw aside her flimsy garment.  In thatgesture she seemed to be throwing aside all the bourgeois capitalistsociety norms.  It was all she was wearing.  Sam's blood grew hotter.The dress made a raspy zzzrrrmpphhh noise as it fell to the quayside,and a distracting plonk, plonk as it landed...       Suddenly Sam awoke.  It was night in Disgiliath.  There wasanother zzzrrrmpphhh noise, and Sam realized with annoyance that itwas Spiegel snoring.  She lay just down the road with her headtipped back over a dislodged cobblestone.  zzzrrrmpphhh she wentagain.  Sam grumbled and rolled over, hoping to get back to hisdream, when from afar he heard another distant plonk.       Sam lay quiet and listened.       zzzrrrmpphhh zzzrrrmpphhh zzzrrrmpphhh.       plonk.       Sam closed his ears.  Rosie!  Sweet Rosie!  Let me get back tomy erotically-charged passionate horny dreams about Rosie.       zzzrrrmpphhh zzzrrrmpphhh.  A long silence.  The snores hadstopped.  Spiegel had rolled a different way and now lay on thecobbles with her hands in her lap and her legs spread, moaning quietlyin some desperately erotic dream of her own.       plonk.       Sam looked in the direction of the sound.  It came fromsomewhere near the Leonard of Quirm exhibit.  Or maybe further eastaround the Future Of Agriculture: Screw Archimedes! pavilion.  Ormaybe...       There was a flap.  Sam's eyes looked up.  Some blocks awaythe Sky Scraping Building loomed over their heads.       In the days of Insultir, grandson of Isildur and Andrea Doriathe Sea-queen, was Disgiliath the City of Tomorrow founded.  And manywonders were produced by the Atlanteans in those their glory daysthough most of their achievements failed just as the warranties wererunning out.  And chief among their wonders were the great spireswhich reached towards the stars: Orthanc the Eyesore of Isengard theybuilt, and Emyn Bereave of the North famed in legend before it fellover, and the Barad-dur which was built as a birthday-present beforebeing corrupted to evil.  Yet these were as assays in the craftbefore the building of Tol Ist, the Needle of Heaven, which legendsays scraped the very sky itself and rent holes in the ozone.Legend has it the stars had to detour around the top.  High overDisgiliath it loomed.  Even as it was being built Insultir said thatall buildings would be like it in the future: tall and imposing anddevoid of personality.       Yet Insultir's dream was to fail him.  With the lack ofelevators and adequate ventilation most people died before theyreached the top, and those who did survive the climb died becausethere was no indoor plumbing to provide water.  Even when one braveteam of adventurers made it to the top in later years, bearingflagons of water and the long-needed truss supports to complete theroof, their attempt at using the ganderobe resulted in the deaths ofthree of the party and nine civilians on the ground.  As time passedDisgiliath was abandoned and the narrow tower stood unfinished, asilent testament to the worthiness of building codes.       Sam's eyes took in the Tower.  At the very top he saw a giantwing stick out of the roof for a moment before retreating.  It couldjust be seen against the night sky.       Then far below he saw another movement, somewhere deep withinthe glass of the tower.  A tiny figure could be seen on the stairway.It tripped over some unseen obstacle which fell away below it with aplonk.  Even from here there was something familiar about the figure:a certain clumsiness, some shamed and shaking lust that drove thelittle shadow onward.       Sam moved quickly to wake the dreaming Spiegel.  He grabbedher and shook her thigh.       "Oh, no, no more, Sir Peter," Spiegel moaned.  "I simplycouldn't stand another sausage.."       "Wake up, ye wee bint," Sam growled, though the cries ofRosie were still hot in his own mind as well.  He tried not to lethis hand linger on her shaking leg.  "Wake up.  We're in trouble."       "Oh, very well, just five more before dinner..."  Spiegelcontinued, then wakefulness took her and she jumped, startled.  Shestared at Sam and turned aside quickly crossing her legs.  "I'mfine," she snapped.  "Just dreaming.  Perfectly healthy.  Perfectlynormal."  After a moment she looked again at Sam.  "Why are youwaking me up?  It's the middle of the night."       "Master Frodo's still alive," Sam whispered urgently."He's climbing the Tower.  I don't know what mischief he's up to."       It was short work to pack their provisions and walk thestreets to the base of the Tower.  Soon they reached the giant doorsof the great edifice.  Long ago had they been smashed by Orcs andvandals.  The lobby was filled with debris and the skeletons ofcorpses, some of which had dropped from a great height.  In thecorner stood the beginning steps of a great stair, which wound upthe sides of the tower and was lost to sight.       There were also many pieces of broken rock.  "What are thesefrom?" Spiegel wondered aloud.       "I think they're stairs that fell," Sam replied.  And indeedthe chunks of broken stone were very much the same shade and shapeas the stairs, which Sam and Spiegel now noticed were often crackedwhere they joined the wall.  Both looked at the stairs suspiciously."If I had my druthers," Sam said to himself, "I'd just stay here atthe bottom and kill Frodo as he came back down.  But I saw some sortof giant bird at the top of the Tower and there's no telling whetherMr Frodo might try to make a getaway on it.  That bloody bastardBilbo did something similar once."       "Damn it," Spiegel answered.  "I was really hoping he'ddrowned."       Someone had already pushed a path in the debris between thedoor and the stairs.  They followed the path and found a wet piece ofcard at a tight turning of the path.  Spiegel picked it up.  It wasa soaked waterlogged subscription card for Playtark.  "It's Frodoall right," she said sullenly.       Without speaking further they started up the stairs.       At first the steps were grimy and covered with dust, debrisand the occasional body.  As they progressed upwards the stepsgradually became less worn, and the dust and debris lessened.The two quietly continued upward.       The view out the windows gradually rose over the rooves ofDisgiliath.  Sam and Spiegel were able to see further and furtherinto the night as they slowly gained altitude.  Curiously, as theyclimbed higher the air became increasingly stifling.  "It's thisdamn glass," Spiegel gasped.  "None of the windows open.  Who woulddesign a building this way?"       "Some twit," Sam gasped in return.       They continued upward.  Spiegel walked just in front of Sam,stepping rhythmically up the long stairs.  Sam followed.  Being acouple of stairs behind, Sam's view consisted mainly of Spiegel'sass.  It continued bouncing just in front of him, flexing on oneside, then the other, then one side, then the other...       Sam was already exhausted.  The stairs and the lack of airwere torching his already overheated blood.  The curvature of Spiegeltempted him, tormented his hormone-crazed mind, yet it gave him thestrength to continue.  Yet in another way it also made it harder forhim to walk.  "Rosie," he said to Spiegel absently.  "How can youkeep going like that?"       "Stairmaster," Spiegel replied.  "Used it for months.  Itdidn't help."       They continued.  After another half-mile had passed the airhad become stifling as a glass-walled tomb.  Sam's hormones alonewere giving him the energy and will to go on, following that ass,those thighs...  The horny dreams of Rosie continued to play in hismind and in his blood.  Spiegel too seemed somehow distracted asthough her own dreams still kept a hold on her.       Then there was a sound like a gunshot!  The stone beneathSpiegel's feet broke from the wall and gave way!  "Sam!" she screamedand Sam threw himself at her shoving her down onto the unbroken stepnearer the wall.  He landed full on top of her.  She felt him againsther.       "Sam," she gasped.       "Rosie," Sam said.  Spiegel's nipples were hard through hervest.  One of her thighs felt warm and wet against his leg.  Her eyeswere pleading.       "I," Spiegel gasped.  "I - can't breathe..."       Without looking Sam reached over and grabbed a piece of stonefrom the broken stair.  He flailed over and smashed the nearest window.       Broken glass rained around them.  A rush of cool air and adusting of rain rushed over their hot bodies.  Air!  Cool andinvigorating it whipped against them, coursed through their lungs,over their overheated flesh.  Both felt suddenly alive, suddenly safe.They laughed for a brief moment, then suddenly became aware of eachother again.       "Sam," Spiegel said again.  Her eyes gazed into his.       "I - but Rosie - Spiegel, I..."  Sam stuttered.  Her lithe,eager body lay in his hands.  For a moment he was too overwhelmed tothink.  "I, I," he began, looking into Spiegel's questioning eyes.He truly wanted his Rosie.  Spiegel was just a traveling companion...yet so close, so willing.  Her arms were already reaching around him.He found his hands reaching for her vest of their own volition.Should he?  After all, he and Rosie weren't formally engaged.  Helooked again at Spiegel's face.  She gazed back at him with a hunger,for him, for acceptance...  After a breath one of her hands reachedslowly for his belt.  Her hips rose off the stair so that he couldslide her dress up more easily.  Should he take her and the releaseshe offered?  Would Rosie feel it was a betrayal?  Would the authorof a good versus evil fantasy novel actually write such a morallyambiguous action?       "Oh, the hell with it," Sam mumbled to himself.       "Oh Sam!" Her cries reverberated through the Tower."Oh Saaaaaaam!"       Now Sam walked in front, Spiegel following behind, their pacemore leisurely.  They stopped every twenty floors or so to smashanother window for ventilation.  Both were calmer.  A rain began tofall outside and Spiegel managed to refill a canteen from the waterrunning off a broken windowpane before they continued.       "I still feel a little odd all the same," Sam told her."I've told you about Rosie.  She's still my girl.  But...  but you'requite a woman.  And sexy.  Very sexy."       "So are you," Spiegel smiled.  "Rosie's lucky."       There was a change coming over Spiegel.  Even Sam had noticedit.  Before now she had always thought of herself as unsexy andunlovable.  Yet the passion that had consumed them had also made herview herself differently.  Before she had been certain she wasloathsome.  Now she was no longer sure what she was.       They continued for a moment in silence.       "Why did you come on this quest, Sam?" Spiegel asked.       Sam spat.  "At first because I was Frodo's servant," he growled."And then because I thought I could blackmail him.  And then laterbecause I wanted to see him die in th' hands o' the Dark Lord.  Butnow...  now an' I'll be honest I don't know why the hell I'm doin'it.  An' that's a fact."       Spiegel looked thoughtful.  "Then maybe we should just killhim," she volunteered.       Sam walked in silence for a moment.  When he spoke he wasangrier and his brogue was thicker.  "I'd love nothin' more than t'seethe wee pig bleed," he answered.  "It'd give me the the joyfuls,'twould.  But... either the Deed is good, or 'tisn't.  If 'tis, thenhe's trapped in Nurnenshire an' I get Bag End an' the resources I needt'start th' war ag'inst the bourgeoisie.  If 'tisn't, then I get MrFrodo Baggins back t' the Shire alive an' people'll lynch him andstart the Revolt sure as spades."       "Just like that?" Spiegel asked.       "Aye."  Sam smiled grimly.  "Most o' the economic troublesi' the Shire started when his nuncle Bilbo returned from foreign parts.About ruined the economy, he did, an' made the class divisions acutean' hard.  If Master Frodo so much as shows his face in the Shireagain after seein' foreign parts people'll roise up wi' torches andpitchforks rather than risk seein' that trouble agin, you mark mywords.  A Baggins returnin' from foreign parts is bad news, an'everyone knows it."       "But is all that necessary?" Spiegel asked.  "After all, youcan just kill him here.  End of Frodo Baggins."       "But there's others back in the Shire," Sam replied.  "Otherwealthy bastards there are, almost as bad as Mr Frodo.  I can't killthem all on my own, now can I?  No, Spiegel, I need to start a fireamong the people, that'll kill 'em all.  An' to light that fire oneway or th' other I need Mr Frodo alive.  Damn him."       Spiegel understood.  She said nothing.       "But once the fire's lit I'll have th' satisfaction o' killinghim later," Sam added quietly.       For an hour and yet another they continued.  Sam's legs werein agony as they began to near the summit.  Even Spiegel, veteran ofmany a piece of exercise equipment, was moving slowly and starting tolimp.  "Stairs," Sam began to mutter.  "I hate stairs."       "I'll never be able to look at another stairmaster ever again,"Spiegel gasped.       Once again Spiegel was in front.  Sam again had a constantview of her ass, but was now too tired from climbing to admire it.On a few occasions they had to work around the edges of broken stairswhich had fallen long years ago.  Below they could see the terrifyingdrop to the base of the Tower.  They tried not to look.       As they stopped for a moment to catch their breath they wentsilent.  Some eerie noise like a caw of terror came from above.  Itwas followed by a caw of disgust.  "Come on!" Sam said quickly."It's Mr Frodo, I'd bet.  We've got to hurry!"       There were only a few windings left of the great stair.Spiegel and Sam hurried up the last coils of the stairway as bestthey could.  Spiegel almost tripped and regained her footing.  AsSam followed her he could see what had been in her path: a discardedcopy of Playtark opened to an overused centerfold and Frodo's shoes.A feeling of dread horror and nausea came over him.  He hurried on.       At the top of the stairs there was a black hatchway in a blackceiling, the floor for the ancient parapet where Insultir oncepurposed to grasp the stars and hang advertising from them.  Thehatchway closed for untold generations now stood open.  The deepblue of the pre-dawn sky reached through it.  Spiegel went throughthe hatchway, Sam heard her scream and then she turned back to theopening with her hand over her mouth.  Sam heard voices as well.A huge leathery voice yelled:       "Get off!  Get off!"       "Feathers," cried the voice of Frodo.  "Oh God, feathers!"       "Leggo a me!  Leggo!"       Sam darted the last few yards and was struck by revulsion atwhat he saw.  A giant eagle, fully eighteen feet high, stood on thegreat parapet trying to balance its weight on one leg.  On that legwas Frodo, grasping the eagle with both arms and legs with eroticrapture and desperation mixed on his sweaty face.  The eagle wastrying to pull Frodo off his leg with the claw of the other leg.       "But feathers are erotic," Frodo whined.  "Pleease!"       "Stop humping my leg!" screamed the giant bird.  "Stop it!You there!  Will you get this thing off my leg!"       Sam, knowing an order when he heard one, looked around andfound a 2x4 from a roof truss abandoned centuries ago.  He quicklypicked it up and hit Frodo with it as hard as he could.  In his eroticdesperation Frodo hardly noticed so Sam stuck the 2x4 between Frodo andthe eagle and pried him loose.       "Oh God Sam," Frodo gasped.  "But I was so close."       "Oh, shut up," Sam replied angrily.  "And put your pants on,for God's sake.  Show some modesty."       "You don't know the weight of my burden," Frodo continued."That single Eye taunts me day and night."       "Ewwww," Spiegel said.       "What you need is a cold shower.  Here," Sam replied, and heunbelted his canteen and hit Frodo squarely in the face with it.Frodo subsided into a fevered swoon which was an improvement.       Sam stopped and looked around.  The place they found themselvesin was fully open to the sky, ringed by a stone wall roughly shoulder-high and clearly unfinished.  Rusted tools and pieces of a roof thatwas never built were lying off to one side.  There were low spots onthe wall where one could look down from the dizzying height if onedared.  In the middle of the open room stood the eagle.       Sam had heard stories about the eagles from Bilbo and Gandalfand the Elves and had quite reasonably thought they were all a packof lies.  Yet here stood one of the great birds before him.  "Areyou real?" he brought himself to ask.       "Are you?" the huge bird replied sarcastically.  "Am I real!Your nature-boy buddy seems t'think I'm real enough.  Did you seethat!  Disgusting, I call it.  Good thing you got here when you did,that's all I've got t'say."       "Sorry about that," Sam answered.  "He's just some sort ofpervert."       "I noticed," the eagle replied.  The bird walked over to thewall and began scraping his leg against the stone.  "Eucchhh.  I needa bath.  First people to climb up here in two thousand years and oneof 'em's gotta be an aviophile.  Say," the eagle turned to Sam.  "Areyou with him?"       "Uh," Sam replied, "no.  Well, sort of."       "What are you up to?" the eagle said suspiciously.       "Oh, nothing important, really," Sam replied looking away."Save the world, drop the Ring into Mordor, start a revolution, killa few hundred people.  That's all.  Nothing much, really."       "Oh, is that all?" the eagle replied, looking relieved.  "Well,good luck to you then."       The eagle turned away, evidently done with the conversation.It continued to examine and flex its leg.  Sam looked at Spiegel andat the swooning Frodo and thought how nice it would be to get thiswhole Mordor thing over with and start the Revolution.  He turnedagain to the eagle.       "Uh, Mr Eagle, sir," Sam began.       "What?" the bird replied impatiently, looking up only briefly.       "Well, uh, sir, would..."  Sam's mind raced through all thedrivel he had been forced to endure in Rivendell.  "Are you one ofthe great eagles of the King of the West, chief of the Velour andLord of All Western Lands Until The End Of The World?"       "Yeah," replied the eagle.  "So?"       "Well," Sam said hesitantly, "I was sort of hoping that youcould, you know, maybe see your way clear to, uh, helping us on ourquest and flying us and the Ring into Mordor and, well, that sort ofthing."       Sam took a breath to continue but stopped short as the eaglegazed at him.  The look in the bird's eyes made him step back.  Samsuddenly thought he should apologise and ask the bird to forget he'dever asked.  But the eagle spoke first.  "Quest, huh," it answered,biting off the word quest like a cracker.  "Want me to help on a quest,is that it?"       "Well, I-"       "Heh!" the eagle spat in disgust.  "'Oh Mister Eagle, there'sthis quest, could you just fly me somewhere?'  'Oh Mister Eagle, couldyou just take care of these wolves, we're on a quest you see'?  'Ohcute little birdie, Manwe needs a favor, could you just swoop down likean avenging army on these Orcs, you see it's for a quest?'  Think Ihaven't heard it before?  Think we haven't been pressed into serviceevery time someone has a little problem?  Think we eagles have nothingbetter to do with our time than fly around on quests?"       "Well, uh," Sam stuttered, "I once heard that you sometimes-"       "You once heard some stupid fairy-tale or another about howyour great grand-uncle the beer salesman invented fire and got savedfrom some mountain trolls by, let me guess, an eagle!  A giant eaglethat outflew the wind and killed the stonetrolls and got your unclea beer and never accepted payment and flew away never to be seen again,wasn't that it?"  The eagle sneered in disgust.  "Oh, yeah.  You knowall about eagles.  Everyone knows all about eagles."       "I don't," Spiegel said, genuinely innocent.  "What abouteagles?"       The eagle looked at Spiegel, startled.  It looked into hereyes for a long moment.  Then its expression softened.  "You reallydon't, do you?" it said.  "You haven't heard all the old stories."       "No," Spiegel said.  "I didn't get out much."       The eagle nodded.  Then it began to sing quietly.  It is saidby the loremasters that Lustianne of old taught the birds how to singand that in their voices one can hear the beauty of her voice but theeagles must not have been there for class that day because this one'ssong came out mainly as a series of harsh, rusty-sounding croaks:       Far off in time     in ancient days       When ancient powers     ruled the world       Were eagles made.      They grew in strength       And ate their food     from Manwe's hand.       At least at first.      But then the King       found work for us     and sent us off       To watch the world     or guard some pass       Or tidings bring.      And so we flew       Like errand-boys     around the world       To interfere     at Manwe's word.       For years and years     as Ages passed       We did the work.      The news we brought,       The Dragons fought,     the heroes saved       With never thanks.      And after time       We formed resent.      The Gods all sat       Upon their mountain     drinking beer       While all the Eagles     did the work.       "Oh Eagle, please     put out that fire,       Get me a drink,     fetch me a sword!       Be quick about it."     For all that       Nobody ever     gave us thought,       Sang out our tale,     wrote us a poem.       Deus ex machina     was our fate.       And yet we bore     indignities       In stoic silence.      So it went       Until Atlantis.                           Then that fool       Called Manwe got     this bright idea!       "I'll scare those guys!     To them I'll send       My eagles cloth'd     in clouds of night,       And lightning will     fall from their crowns."       And off we went.      That stupid fool!       He gave no thought     to our well-being       And sent us off     to Numenor       With lightning-rods     and Van de Graffs       To generate     electric charge,       Uninsulated!   Scare the Men?       We scared ourselves     and scarred ourselves       Much worse than they.      And many died,       like Thorondor     our mighty King       Who took a hit,     was shocked, and burned       And fell to ruin.      We left for good,       And Manwe had     to sink them all       Without our help.                             And now we live       in Middle-earth     on mountain-tops       and hidden caves.      We answer not       When Manwe calls.      We fly for fun       And laugh at men     and steal their sheep.       In legends we don't     interfere.       We might fly out     and help someone       Just for a laugh     or for a bribe       Of mutton dear,     if such we seek.       But "Ooo, a Quest!"     won't get you more       than laughing scorn     or falling rocks.What do you think?" the eagle concluded.       "It's a bit long," Sam muttered.       "Anyway, after that bit of Second Age stupidity we eagleshave kept mostly to ourselves.  It's nothing personal, but we'vegotta look out for ourselves, y'know.  It's kind of funny but-" theeagle leaned a little closer to Spiegel and spoke conspiratorially,"after we'd left, Manwe had t'do his own housekeeping as far as theworld's concerned, y'see?  He couldn't lean on us anymore, so now hestarts this new policy of 'Oh, don't want to go directly inter-ferin' in the world any longer,' 'cause he don't want t'do it himself,y'see? Personally, I think he's just a lazy bastard."       "Oh," Sam said.  There wasn't much to say.       "Well, thanks anyway," Spiegel said.  "I liked your story.I'm sorry we intruded on your time."       "Yeah, thanks a lot, sorry to disturb you, we'll just take ourpervert back downstairs now," Sam added.  Then he stopped.  He hadforgotten about the stairs.       "Uh, Mr Eagle," he started again nervously.  "Do you thinkyou could just maybe fly us back to Minas Tirith?  Or, well, just tothe base of the Tower?  I'll give you a sandwich.  It's got cornedbeef, see, look."       The eagle ignored him.       "Oh, the stairs," Spiegel frowned.  "I'd forgotten about thestairs."       The great bird looked up.  "You don't wanna take the stairs,miss?" he asked her.  "Can I give you a ride to the ground?"       "Oh, would you?" Spiegel smiled.       "Happy to," the eagle replied.  "You're a good listener, andyou seem friendly.  And you didn't ask me to go on any quests," headded, spitting out the word.  "Come on.  We can talk some more on theway down."       It seized her in a giant talon and stretched its mighty wings."Heh!  You don't weigh anything at all," it said.  Spiegel smiledbrightly and hugged the bird's ankle affectionately. They flewgracefully over the wall.       "When will you be back for us?" Sam called out.       "Heh!" the eagle snorted.  "You two can walk."       It was dusk of the next day before Frodo and Sam finally madeit back down the stairs.  "Ye'll never see me using a staircase againfor the rest o' my life," Sam grumbled.  "Not ever ever ever."       "I don't know what's coming over me, Sam," Frodo said.  "Ithink the Ring is affecting me.  All my thoughts are becoming twisted.I fear I'm only going to get more perverse as we near Mordor."       "Tough break for ye," Sam muttered.       Frodo nodded.  "Last night as I was climbing the Tower I evenhallucinated.  I thought I heard you making love to that scarecrow.Hah!  If you could even imagine that."       Sam's eyes blazed red fury, but he said nothing.       They came out the great doors and found Spiegel waiting forthem in the street.  "That eagle was so nice," she smiled.  "Andlook!  He left us some mutton!  And he gave me a card with the nameof a good therapist on it."       Frodo almost replied, but a sudden elbow from Sam cut himoff.  "Oh, sorry, Master," he said with only a little biting irony.       Later on they found the bridges to Minas Tirith were all out,and so they unwillingly went back to the cross-roads from whence theycame.  Late on the third night they made it back to the crossing,where they found Gullible sitting on a rock idly drumming his fingers.       "'Sss about time you made it back, saddam," he hissed.
     Accompained by a soft stream of saddams, Gulible viewed thecompany in disgust. Sam was wearing a happy yet resolute face whichpractically screamed, "I'm a continually failing, eternally doubtingrevolutionary, but at least I know how to handle the ladies"; and hekept throwing quick glances at Spiegel, who ignored them with amysterious inward smile. Frodo kept tugging at his clothes for noobvious reason, except perhaps for a crawling slug he had noticed onthe roadside. Gulible sighed.     "We can't stay here, precious, no, saddam," he said, and noticinghow little effect his voice had on them, raised it from a wheeze to arasp. "Would any of you like to see the pleasures this place has tooffer?" he asked with a sly grin.     For lack of better suggestions they followed him, through lushgreen parks and stately piazzas, until they reached the pulsatingentertainment district of Disgiliath, known for some unknown reason asCirith Ungallant. All of a sudden they found themselves surrounded byit all: flashing lights, flashing dresses, leering orcs singingoperettas in falsetto. "It's a fallen place, and that's a fact," saidSam, regarding a dancing southron of the female variety with all thedisapproval he could muster.     "Yeah, and it's horribly sexist," said Spiegel, who was busycondemning a display of imaginatively shaped dildos.     At the call of Gulible they ran to a store of leatherwares whereFrodo sat in the innermost corner, refusing to come out. "They're mine,precious! We wants them!" he screamed whenever someone tried to takeaway the studded collar and leash he was clutching. The proprietor'sassurances that the items were meant for dogs only did not help onelittle bit, but at last Sam managed to lure him out with a promise ofa chic poodle trim at the next dog hairdresser they spotted."Hopefully he'll think he's a tortoise by then," Sam muttered toSpiegel, "that idiot, inbred aristocrat." His confidante failed toanswer, however, too occupied in admiring a shiny leather corset.     Finally they were out in the street again, Spiegel several parcelsheavier. "They're the new me," she explained to Sam when he questionedher latest investments. "You don't own me, you know." They continuedtheir ideological discussion as Gulible led them past a gloomy jointcalled "The Mouldy Vampire" decorated with an enormous replica of abat. As Frodo stopped and stared longingly at the giant creature ofthe night, the doors swung open and a dark crowd emerged. They woreall sorts of black clothes: coal-black velvet, soot-black silk,gleaming black PVC. But all their faces were pale, and their angstyexpressions filled the company with fear.     "It is too late! All is lost! I am so hungry," Frodo suddenlywailed, as someone pushed him out of eye contact with his favouriteflying rodent. (Of course bats aren't rodents, really. But thisparticular one - long-eared, long-toothed and carrying a magnificentcarrot - could certainly pass for one.)     "Be quiet, Frodo," said everyone; and then Gulible explained:"They're just a band of wandering visit-goths, on their way to destroysome empire or other. They're none of our business, saddam."     Frodo looked at their guide with newfound respect. "By jove,Gulible!" he exclaimed. "For one with such freakish speech impediments,you sure know a lot!"     "Yes, saddam," muttered Gulible softly and turned away.     They did their best to mingle with the Disgillians - in order tobetter understand their culture, they all agreed. "The bush... thebarsh will not be burned against the wall, come the revolution," saidSam loudly, after they had had a thorough introduction to the drinkingcustoms of the area. Spiegel nodded and smiled while Gulible desperatelytried to edge his barstool closer to hers.     As it finally tipped over, she gasped and pointed. "Oh my Eru...Look!"     Sam looked up, suddenly sober, and saw Frodo up at the bar, doingan extravagant performance of the Bree-dance.     "Quick, take Gulible!" he barked, knowing they had to stop hismaster at once. Spiegel understood immediately, and together they swungtheir guide through the air so that he collided with Frodo with asatisfying thud.     "I can see stars, Gulible," whispered Frodo later. He giggledinsanely. "But my head is in the ocean."     "That's because we're in the gutter, preciousss," said Gulible, andfought a sudden urge to kick the drunken hobbit. Getting the group tothe goal seemed more and more difficult. "Sam? Spiegel? Where areyoussss?" he cried, fearing the worst.     "We're coming... soon, Gulible," answered Sam in a muffled voice,and some minutes afterwards they emerged from a back alley, Spiegelrearranging her parcels with elaborate care.     "Look, Frodo," she said at last, handing him a small paper bag."I bought you one after all." Frodo dried his tears and opened thepresent.     "It's beautiful!" he exclaimed, suddenly happy again. "May I putit on now?"     "If you wish, Master," said Sam solemnly. "And I'll take the leash,if you allow, Sir."     And so they were on their way again, Gulible in the lead, Frodo inthe leash, and Sam and Spiegel in an inexplicable fit of giggles. Thescenes were becoming even more spectacular, there were lights, coloursand cheerful people (or something similar) everywhere. Frodo stopped and said: "What is this place, Gul...omph!"     As they walked on, Gulible answered: "We're now in the heart ofCirith Ungallant. This is the original entertainment district, of whichall other glitzy places are mere copies. They say a new position isdiscovered every day here." He glanced at Sam and Spiegel. "Withcertain restraints, of course. Saddam."     Loud music and cheers erupted from a palace-like building at theend of the street. Gulible quickened his pace as he walked towards it,Spiegel ran after as she remembered she really had to do a thing notalways mentioned by authors, and Sam marched briskly after them,dragging Frodo behind him. Gulible greeted the bouncer as an oldfriend and Spiegel scurried past him looking for the closest loo. Theguide turned around with a great smile as he said to the bouncer: "Andthiss is the Ringbearer."     Sam had just reached the door and was panting heavily. "I'mafraid," he gasped, "I'm afraid I just strangled the Ringbearer."
     It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsexcept at occasional intervals, when it was checked by aviolent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it isin Mordor that our scene lies, or close enough as nomatter), rattling along the housetops, and fiercelyagitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggledagainst the darkness.  Sam thought he heard the sound trackto some horror flick or other, but couldn't be sure.     He was standing around awkwardly holding the apparentlydefunct Frodo's leash, in the magnificent piazza that formedthe centre of Cirith Ungallant.  Gulible looked at him withirritation; the bouncer, an immaculately clad Orc, with mildamusement.  Fearful and yet insidiously attractive was thevista that opened itself before his eyes, like that of a B-rated horror film combined with that of a science-fictiondictatorship combined with that of a second-ratepornographic film. The setting was very noir, with muchchiaroscuro, like the old Batman comics in the youth of theShire.  Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw avehicle on which was written the words "Mystery Machine."The female pulchritude on display assaulted his senses likeunto the onslaught of Mordred's forces upon the Vale ofGondolas.     An eeresome Nightclub, bedight with Halloweenery andenshrouded in bright tang-coloured orange, lowered beforetheir awe-stricken gaze. They beheld on its steps many ajack-o-lantern, within which flickered a deadly sheen, acorpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing (or so Frodoalways said; but Sam and Spiegel thought it was marvellous -"just like Times Square," the latter said, cryptically).Resplendent with neon lights was the Nightclub, and bedightwith a thousand posters such as simply would not have beenallowed in the Shire.  A spider-motif dominated thebuilding, with iron gates and fences, as well as windows,filigreed in the manner of spider webs. They were come tothe most fashionable district west of Barad-dûr, and thebat-motif of the older-buildings was nowhere to be found. The Halloween kitsch filled Sam with a sense of dread."I do believe in spooks," he muttered in a Brooklyneseaccent.  Most terrifying of all was the entrance, with itsincandescent jack-o-lanterns and plastic ghosts andskeletons; an enormous rubber spider hung from one of thetowers.  On a large neon sign they beheld the words"Hselob's Niggitculb," written in teuncwar.     But at the moment, Sam had a more immediate concern. Itappeared that he had tied Frodo's collar a little too tight,motivated perhaps by some unconscious desire to get rid ofthe ugly and sexually challenged reactionary decadentexploitative despicable bastard; but he was not yet dead.     "With slow, stupid hobbit's lab kit, we might be ableto do something, my preciousss," muttered Gulible. "Forkit over, saddam!"     Reluctantly Sam obeyed, and Gulible got to work withpracticed expertise: he examined the contents of Sam'slaboratory kit, grunted with satisfaction, and then mixedthe contents of various test-tubes together with the air ofone who knows exactly what he is doing.     "Don Giovanni hass produced a chemical compound thatwill revive nasty rich hobbit," he said at length. "Itwill also causse a very ssslight reduction in thepatient'ss erotic madness, precious.  It may have someside-effects, owing to the predominance of 2-amino-2-deoxy-[..."     "Just gie it to the scoundrel!" said Sam.     Gulible carefully poured the contents of one of histest-tubes down Frodo's left nostril. After a bit ofwheezing and coughing, Frodo sat up and blinked his eyes inconfusion.      "Where am I?" he asked.  "I feel... different.  I nolonger need to have sex all the time; only three fourths ofit. And I am no longer sexually attracted to everything Isee, only most things."     "Pretty impressive, Giovannino!" said the bouncer.     "Aw, shucksses; biochemistry is just one of ourhobbies, saddam," replied Gulible.     The bouncer was about to reply when Spiegel came backfrom the restroom, bubbling with delight.     "What a wonderful country this is!" she cried. "Ientered the women's room, fully expecting to find somedisgusting hole in the ground, as in the Shire.  Instead, Ibeheld an object of great beauty: a large white porcelainbowl, full of limpid water, and behind it a rectangularwhite tank adorned with a mysterious metal handle.  Howclean and lovely it is!  I nabbed a towel on the way out -may I keep it?"     "It's all yours, ma'am," said the bouncer politely.This was the First Towel.     "Yet another modern improvement of whilk the oppressorshae depreeved us," observed Sam.       "Um, who's that guy?" asked Spiegel, referring to theubiquitous portraits of a guy who looked like a head with anenormous eye in the middle, but no torso to speak of.     "Yon must be Sauron," said Sam.  "Dinna ye see theposters, urging all tae 'Adore Sauron, Our Beloved Leader,'or pointing out that 'Sauron Loves You, Especially If You'reFemale'?"     "He's handsome!" gushed Spiegel.  "I wonder if he has agirlfriend?"     "He doessss, my precioussss," said Gulible. "Look!"  Hepointed at a portrait of a scantily clad eight-legged womanwith a very voluptuous bosom, underwritten "Shelob Is theLove of Sauron's Life."     "Well, at least thanks to Boromir and Sa... y...well, that really good-looking guy who makes love like amûmak in heat, I know I'm not ugly," sighed Spiegel. "Butif only I could have a guy who actually loved me for myselfinstead of lusting for my famous bosom just once in my life,I could die happy. Our bodies are not our selves."  Samsaid nothing, but tried to control the ravenous desire thatdevoured his limbs like unto a bevy of hobbits in a mushroom-patch. Gulible made no such effort, but slobbered openly.Fortunately, their attention was distracted somewhat by thelovelies on view; for the loremasters say that Shelob'sNightclub gave a new meaning to the phrase, "nekkidwimmin."     "May you soon get your wish," said the bouncer toSpiegel, with deep sincerity. The bouncer was an attired inan elegant uniform emblazoned with the Eye of Sauron and theWeb of Shelob. He looked very sharp, if somewhat swarthy andbrachycephalic, as befits demonized Others.     "This place is so beautiful!" said Spiegel wistfully."Please tell us where we are!"      "This is Shelob's Nightclub, the Wonder of the World,owned and operated by the wogah of Sauron the Great," hereplied. "Gorbush at your service," he added, kissingSpiegel's hand. "Would you like to come in?"     "Aye," said Sam.  "We would."     "I would need to question this lady in private, first,"said Gorbush, but his voice and the look he gave Spiegelmade it only too evident what kind of questioning he hadin mind.     Spiegel smiled. "That seems only reasonable."     "Enchanted," said Gorbush, and the twain went off, armin arm, to some obscure side-room or other.  As they watchedher, Sam and Gulible were seething with lust and jealousy;Frodo, on the other hand, was distracted by the torment ofthe Stone, which made him lust after fishes, and of theRing, which made him believe he had a chance in Angband ofseducing them. Spiegel was apparently taking her time.     After an hour or two Spiegel came back with Gorbush onher arm.  "Gorbush is a really sensitive guy," she said."He writes poetry and really knows how to make a girl gowogah!" Sam and Gulible's eyes bored into the Orc's facewith all the benevolent subtlety of a Mentish laser ray.      "I did not realize your situation was so bleak," saidGorbush.  "This lovely lady" - he stroked Spiegel's long,silky-soft hair - "is worth a hundred floor shows. You cango in, but I'm going to have to escort you, in order toprotect the lady. We have to be careful, on account of thatevil drug cartel."     "Dinnae mention the Ring, master!" cried Sam, beforesuddenly realizing his mistake.  "Och nae!" he groaned indespair.  "If ye keep openin' your big mouth ye'll end upbetrayin' the Cause, as me gaffer always used tae say, andthat's a fact.  Ye're nocht but a Menshevik, he mostwaysused to add.  But I'll nae be captured by Sauron thateasily.  I'll sell me life dearly."  He took out his swordand drew it.     "What are you getting so operatic about?" inquiredGorbush, apparently taking little interest in the Ring."You are our honoured guests.  Both Shelob and Sauron willbe eager to meet you. You will be spending the night in theNightclub's guest-quarters until Sauron the Great can findyou more worthy lodgings.  But for now, would you like toenjoy the floor show?  There is nothing to fear."     Sam wasn't so sure, as he heard a shrieking soundissuing from the bowels of one of the guardrooms: it mighthave been a damned spirit, it might have been an Elvishcaptive, it might have been an inebriated Balrog, it mighteven have been Maria Khallas, but it was probably someoneenjoying the floor show a leetle too much. His curiosityovercame his fear. Anyway, they had no other plan at themoment, so they followed the Orc into the Nightclub. WhenGorbush uttered the password Trick or treat, Frodo couldnot suppress a shudder.     Ignoring the remarks of the habitués, like "Not fromaround here," and "The clientele are becoming frightfullycommon," the companions entered and gazed at the brightlights and gorgeous semi-clad beauties such as HughHefnaistos, who was what passed among the Valar for the Godof Wisdom, might have dreamed up in a delirium. One of them,a very provocatively dressed blowfish, was ensconced insidean aquarium tank. Orcs silently served the companionspicturesque local alcoholic beverages.     "These are the 'Rog Grisettes," said Gorbush after theparty had stared at the beauties for several minutes? hours?days? - for they soon lost all sense of time and distance."Except that one of them - Froufrou - is a blowfish. That'sa little kinky for my tastes ..."     The Balrog Grisettes pitilessly exposed their lovelinessto Sam and Gulible's heterosexual gaze. Whether Sam too hadsome cursed article of clothing - like everyone else(possibly his socks) - or the lustful side of hispersonality, which Spiegel called Kinko, was once againgaining the upper hand over the loyal revolutionary (whomshe called Pinko), this tale does not tell.     Frodo had eyes only for Froufrou the blowfish, or elsefor his shoelaces.  The sinuous sensuality of her scalesmade him go wogah.  For need drove him.     "I want to grip her smooth, scaly body between my-"     "I dinnae want to hear it," said Sam. "I was sick ofyour sex life months ago, an' that's a facht!!!!!"     Things got even worse for the hobbits when theGrisettes began to sing a tune by Orc-operetta composerLehár:     Tra-la-la-la-la-la-lally!     Trippel trapp and trippel trapp!     Welcome all to Shelob's Valley,     Trippel trapp and trippel trapp!     We are the 'Rog Grisettës,     have wings and castañetas:     Lolo, Dodo, Joujou, Cloclo, Froufrou, Morgot...(But Froufrou of course sang "fins," not "wings.")Frodo's heart caught fire; and without thinking of what hedid, whether he acted out of folly, despair, courage, orinsatiable lust, he jumped onto the stage and into theaquarium, taking the phial in his left hand while hecaressed Froufrou the Fish with his right, before kissingher ardently. Then he belted "Et moi!" - upon which hepromptly stared at his shoelaces again while Froufroulaughed provocatively.  The audience roared its approval.     But there are other powers in Muddle-earth, powers ofthe night; and they are tildy and strong.  And She who dweltin the darkness had heard the Elves give that cry in thedepths of time, and it had not troubled her then; nor did itnow.  While Frodo spoke, he felt a great malevolencedirected towards him and a deadly gaze. The coming threatwas at last unveiled.  For Shelob, when she appeared, waseven hotter than her posters had depicted her. The glow ofthe star-glass was broken by the thousands of facets of herbosoms, but behind the glitter a deadly flame began to glow,kindled by evil thoughts.  Monstrous and lasciviously half-closed eyes she had, but guided by a goal and a dreadpurpose, and they gloated over their prey that sat helplesswithout any hope of escape; either that, or Frodo had hadfar too much fermented bat's blood (or was it a side-effectfrom Gulible's medicine?), for Sam and Gulible recollectednothing more untoward than an unusual degree of femalepulchritude.     There long had she dwelt, a sensual creature inMaidenform® (or out of it, as the case might be) - the sameas of old dwelt in the land of the Elves that has sunkbeneath a mounting pile of debt; like unto those whom Blutohad tried to seduce in the Mountains of Wogah in Doriath andhad come long ago over the green grass in Lustianne.  HowShelob came to Mordor, fleeing from her creditors, no taletells; for few accounts remained open in the Dark Years.But she was there still, who was there before Sauron, andbefore the first stones of the Barad-dûr Museum, Opera-House, Fortress of Dread, and Ballet Theatre were laid; shehad built her nightclub there, gouging the wallets of Elvesand Men.     Then Sauron had shown her what wogah was really allabout, and her bosom became swollen and fat from continuousstimulation in Sauron's revels.  For all portions of thefemale anatomy were Sauron's food, and Shelob's pheronomeswere darkness.  Far and wide were scattered their offspring -even as far as the Shire - bastards of their miserablemates, whom they had rather left holding the baby.  But noneof Sauron's women could rival her, Shelob the Great, hottestbabe of Ungallant to wogah the tildy world.     And as for Sauron, he knew where she lay.  And itpleased him that she should dwell there, hungry butundiminished in physical attributes, a more insatiablenymphomaniac than his own fantasies could have devised.  Orc-maidens had made nice enough concubines, but he had them inplenty, and after all, they lacked the sexual capacity ofthe Maiar.  Shelob had that and to spare.  And as a man maythrow a dainty to his cat ("his cat," he calls her, but sheowns him not), so Sauron had added various adornments andbeautification projects to Shelob's Nightclub, making it thegaudiest such institution west of Minas Vegas.     Shelob sauntered onto the stage, gnawing the skull ofthe Hobbits dared not guess what creature, but they weresure it tasted just like chicken.  A loud chord resounded inthe orchestra.  As Gulible gazed upon her lascivious form,he was filled with an intense, almost uncontrollable desireto wogah her, were it only symbolically. "Ah, could we butpierces her with something...!" he thought, as heexperienced a physical reaction to her figure.  Forgotten asthe snows of yesteryear (for the moment) was his burningpassion for Spiegel - much to the latter's relief.  She sangthe following csárdás with such intensity that the evilGandalf himself, had he heard it, would have wept:             Vere dvells ze lawve zen?                Ho can me tellink?             Vere dvells ze lorve zen?                Ho ken I eszkink?Then she ripped into the fast movement like a thunderstormover the steppes of Rhûn:    Juszt vonce to vogah, vogah, vogah, vogah,            On ze puszta, by ze Volga,            Juszt vonce to get it on!  The hobbits' blood was churning like a samovar kindled bythe Magic Sun, and when she repeated the song, her passionenflamed the Nightclub to such an extent that thethermometer went up at least twenty degrees Fahrenheit.     When the guys had recovered, they were gazing uponShelob with the gaze of the damned.  "How charmink to meetyou, dahlink!" she said to Frodo.  "May I invite you andyour friends to spend the night and tomorrow to join me fora small, private luncheon for six (not countink ze dancinkgirrls, off curse)?"     "Six?" repeated Frodo, puzzled.     "Vell, yess! You, your sree friends, myself, and Sauronze Great..."     "Ulp!" stammered Frodo.  "Sauron, er, um, whatdoes he want with me?"     "Ve have much to discuss," said Shelob, with a crypticsmile.  "Your estate, for eenstance..."     "Oh, my estate!" said Frodo with a sigh of relief.     "Yes, vat did you sink it vas?" said Shelob. "I hopeyou not gettink your image of me from zose sensationalisticmovies starring Humphri Bogart." Frodo was nonplussed.     "Gorbush!" Shelob whispered to that worthy. "Take zeseguests to ze Lairr! Lurtz, you take Gorbush's place!"     Gorbush led them through the plush, if creepy,vestibule to the elevators, and they travelled up to thethirty-second floor.  Unknown to the hobbits was thisdwimmercaft, and they were sore adrad. The omnipresentvelvet and gilt spider motif began to get rather oppressive.After letting Frodo into an incredibly palatial room fit fora conquering hero or a tobacco lobbyist (with its ownaquarium), Gorbush let Sam and Spiegel into a neighbouringroom, apologizing profusely for the fact that there were notenough rooms for them to be separated at the moment.Gulible,  barely containing his jealous rage, went to sleepin his usual spot, not far from the ladies' changing room.The orc made some polite apologies to Sam and Spiegel forhaving to leave them and, after gallantly handing Spiegel abook of his poems autographed with seven or eight improvisedpoems in her honour - some of them rather explicit - heleft.     Spiegel quickly hid the book of poems in her bra.  Shewas intent upon exploring their room, which was filled withbooks with titles like Nymphomaniacs and Their Ways:Towards a Porno-Ethics of Existentiality and Are Ments aMyth?  The walls, ceiling and bedclothes were covered withthe usual spider-motif.  So was the bath-towel that Samsequestered for his own use (this was the Second Towel). Onthe mantelpiece there were several Lladró figurines ofspiders, Balrogs, Orcs, and other Mordor species, dressed inpicturesque native garb.  Spiegel picked up the rather heftytome entitled Blueprint for the New Order, by Sauron, andstarted leafing through it - murmuring things like, "Sothat's what Gorbush meant when he said Sauron has solutionsfor the evils that bedevil Western society" or "He is avisionary!" or "Imagine a society based upon love!"     "What next?" said Sam, subtly ripping off his shirt.     "Oh, Sam," she said tenderly, "It was you who awakenedme to the fact that I am indeed sexually attractive. I oweyou so much! But can't you see that it was not meant to be?You must be loyal to Rosie, and I must be true to Gorbush,who alone truly loves me!  He massaged me for a whole hourbefore smygelling me!"     "Very well," said Sam with resignation. "If ye needme, I'll be in the bathroom."  He was there for quite along time.     Spiegel felt a little bad about her treatment of Sam,but she knew that after sleeping with Gorbush she couldnever again have another guy - not even Sam, however fondshe was of the latter.  For his lust was not her lust.Little she knew of towers, rings, or Politburos, who desiredonly the joy of all other living things, and for herself anall-encompassing love, swollen till the mountains could nolonger contain it, or the darkness circumscribe it.     Next morning Sam and Spiegel took Gulible to Frodo'sroom, and naturally found the boss firmly ensconced in theaquarium. Sam fished Frodo out. While his boss was gettingcleaned up and dressed, Sam, under some mysteriousinspiration, sang "Se vuol ballare, signor Frodino" in anunknown and sinister language that filled Frodo with dread.     When Gorbush came with breakfast, Spiegel leapt intohis arms.  After they had exchanged a few amorouspleasantries, Gorbush turned to the others and said, "Thereason I've come is to inform you that Shelob - and laterour Beloved Leader, Sauron the Great -  will be comingshortly to honour you with a visit.  You are indeed high inhis favour! I can't stay, I'm afraid.  But I'll be backlater when the coast is clear.  Have a nice day!"  With thathe hastily left - after Orkish-kissing Spiegel for abouttwenty minutes.     The hobbits barely had time to agree not to sayanything about the Ring ("the present," as Don Giovannimysteriously called it), when Shelob arrived in a blacknegligée that flattered her figure yet more than had thewhite gauze she had worn the night before. She chatted withthe hobbits about this and that - the weather in the EthelDuwap, the fashions of Minas Goofy, the latest gossip aboutthe Leechking's love-life - taking a great interest in theirtravels.  Presently, however, she turned to Spiegel andcrooned:     "My dahlink child, do you have any idea who you reallyare?"     "Well, all I know is that I always thought I was fatuntil the late Boromir and... that other guy, my truefriends, showed me that I am not ugly.  It took Gorbush toshow me that I am indeed beautiful and worthy of love." Shewept tears of pure joy.     "You are my descendant, ze rightful heir to Rivendell.El Rond is a usurper who would never have gotten anywherehad he not been one of the hangers-on of ze despicableGandalf - procured animals for heem, I believe, or somesinkeqvally disgusting...  In truth it vas Steinlob the Feministwhose labors made Rivendell possible.  I am Steinlob'sdaughter, and you are my great-great-great-great-granddaughter by Smaug, vich ees givink you dragon-blood. Mydaughter invaded ze Shire vone bright day, and ze reszt eezheestory.  Zat vas before I met Saury and discovered ze truemeanink of vogah. Ven my hubby delivers ze lands of ze Vestfrom ze yoke of zeir current imperialist-hegemonist-neofascist runnink dogs, ve shall restore you to yourrightful place."     Spiegel's eyes shone.  "And Gorbush will rule Rivendellby my side!" she gushed.     "Vatever you vant, dahlink," said Shelob,affectionately kissing Spiegel. "And ve have summonedCassiopeia Took back to Mordor so zat she can return zeDress to you. And you'll get your identity back. It von'thave ze disgustink stains on it eizerr - ze dress, not zeidentity, ahf coarrse."     Spiegel laughed through her tears. Then she asked, "Isthere any way I can arrange therapy sessions with DeeannaTroll?  An eagle recommended her to me and gave me herbusiness card."     "Ve vill speak of ziz later," said Shelob, glowering atthe mention of Deeanna Troll.  "But I sink eet not necessaryeef you gettink ze dress back."     Presently there was another knock at the door, quiet,but portentous.  As Sam opened the door, he beheld a legionof female Orcs, fawning all over none other than the dreadSauron in person.  Sam easily recognized him from theportraits he had seen, but yet more from the sinister menaceof his urbanity, the elegant veneer of malignancy thatconcealed a fundamental dorkiness.  Sauron waved a glovedhand, and the Orcs vanished.     "So many female admirers," he sighed.  "A wiseloremaster once pointed out that we males are not naturallymonogamous.  Having used the Ring, I'm sure you know whatit's like. I am pleased to meet you," he continued in apleasant, yet insidious, baritone, recalling the refinedaccents of Sideshow Bob.  "We were so worried that thosenarcoterrorists might have done something nasty to you. TheWestern part of my domain isn't as safe as I would like; tooclose to Gondor. I am Sauron the Great, at yourservice."     Sam smiled grimly, before asking Sauron, "What's itwairth tae ye?"     "What do you mean?" inquired Sauron.     "Dinnae be sae Foucauldian.  I ken ye wants the Ring.Mak us an offer, or we'll do nocht, and say nocht."     Sauron laughed a sonorous laugh.  Spiegel began to findhim almost more irresistable than Gorbush.     "Oh, the Ring!" he smiled.  "We can talk aboutthat later.  Though I wouldn't use it if I were you; it wasreally only meant for Maiar. And whatever you do, don't dropit into Mt. Viagra, or Gandalf and his evil allies will takeover the world and enslave everyone and turn them intodrugged out zombies without hope."  The hobbits gasped, butSauron, after giving them a sad smile, continuedunperturbed. "I would also avoid using the phial in yourplace, as it is the creation of the evil Fleanor (whom theGnomes call Feenamint) and works his will.  But at themoment I have to give you important news.  For none of youis the insignificant halfling that he or she appears to be -except for you, Gulible, or Gullible, or however you'respelling your nom de guerre these days.  I fear you arebut another interesting narrative irrelevancy."     "We not interesting irrelevancy!" protested Gulible."We Gulible the Great, the Gulible, seduce girlses tentimes a day, Don Giovanni, who bedded 640 women inBree, 231 in Gundabad, 100 in Rivendell, 91 in Trollshaws,but, but, but in the Shire, but in the Shire, we've done1003...!"     "Relax," said Sauron.  "We'll give you a free MordorCredit Card as compensation for not being anyone'sdescendant.  Maybe we'll even put you in charge of the Shireor something."     Gulible seemed pleased by this notion, for he began tomutter, "We shall see, my precious! With credit card we'llpay her back!  We'll pay everyone back!"     "Indeed!" said Sauron, smiling a mysterious, ambiguoussmile that could have meant anything from civilacknowledgement of Gulible's somewhat deranged response to acynical, even sadistic amusement.  "Let us be at ease," hecontinued.  "Fermented bat's blood?"  He held up a bottle ofsome nasty black liquid. The hobbits all agreed withalacrity, and Sauron poured drinks all around, starting withSpiegel, to whom he handed a glassful in an elegant mithrildemitasse adorned with Balrog wings.  "The vintage isexcellent.  It's been aging ever since the forging of theRing."     "Ye said ye had news," observed Sam.     "I do," said Sauron, solemnly.  "Frodo, I am yourfather.  You are my son and heir.  The Nurnenshire estate isbut the beginning.  If you are found worthy, you shallreign over vast kingdoms." (There was a subtle hint of doubtin the if.) "I owe you a few birthday presents," he smiledthrough his tears, as the violins played some mushy tune orother.  Frodo gaped in amaze, while Sam chortledsarcastically behind his hand.     "B-b-b-but, I thought Bilbo was my father," stammeredFrodo.     "He was.  But I am your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.A couple of millennia ago, I had a fling with a winsomehobbit-lass on the banks of the Anduin, before your peoplemoved out of the range of my geographical knowledge.  It wasa moment of weakness; I was on the rebound from Miniwethil,and hadn't yet translated my wogah-WOOOgah with Shelob intosomething more or less permanent.  (Ouch, Shelob makes myhands itch.)"  He stopped for a moment and Orkish-kissedShelob while fondling her passionately. After about half anhour, he resumed: "I thought of telling my hobbit-descendants the truth, but never met anyone who seemedworthy, until I heard of you.  I had to disown my brotherSaurtre after he got involved with those narcoterrorists inthe Morgai.  Even with you, it's a bit of a stretch, but ifyou stay away from drugs, straighten up your sexualidentity, get indoctrinated out of your aristocraticideological presuppositions, pass the test of governing theestate in Nurnenshire (which we're turning into a collectivefarm), and develop something remotely resembling moralfibre, who knows?  Greatness may well be thrust upon you, myson."     The hobbits maintained a stunned silence, but Sauroncontinued his exposition.     "Yes, one reason I wanted you here was to protect youfrom a murderous plot hatched by the drug cartel (NICE, alsocalled That Hideous Strength) run by Gandalf, El Rond, TomBombadildo (whose sex life with Goldberry may fairly bededuced from his name), the Talking Fox, and the mysteriousBrute of Bucklebelt, whose identity I have not yet been ableto determine, and possibly Galadriel, though my groping gotme nowhere with her." Shelob gave a baleful glare.     "O Great Leader!" cried Frodo, kneeling.  "How can Iget rid of the phial!? Is there no briar patch into which Ican toss it? And why did Galadriel ever give it to me? Ithas inflicted upon me a really embarrassing curse."     "We'll give it back to Maglor," said Sauron casually."It's his, he wants it, and frankly he deserves it.  As forGaladriel, if she cheats on her husband, she can also cheaton you."     "But El Rond ..." began Frodo.     "Yes, I know about all that, having a very effectiveintelligence corps, but since he's not the rightful ruler ofRivendell, we'll just consider his little document null andvoid."     "Father!" said Frodo, joyfully. "You are gracious to mebeyond my dessert!"     "We wants CHOKLIT, my precious!" interrupted Gulible,his eyes turning purple at the mention of "dessert." SilentOrc-servants deftly carried out Don Giovanni's wish, as Samcontinued to scowl.     "Weell, if this spineless effeminate bourgeois decadentis the descendant of Sauron, I suppose I'm the scion ofFeenamint," Sam could not quite repress his sarcasm.     "Not quite," said Sauron with a smile.  "However,Lenindil - for that your true name - you are the heir ofIsildur."     "What about Aragon son of Arathon son of Aradud son ofArabarf?" blurted Frodo.     "Who, that?" said Sauron.  "Aragon the Simple! Aragonthe Fool!  But he had just enough wit for the part Gandalfhad appointed for him.  But as for his lineage, it's forged.The truth is, he's Butterburr's bastard brother, the son ofTed Sandyman and Goldberry."     "And hoo, pray, do I manage tae be a descendant ofIsildur?" inquired Sam.     "It's easy," said Sauron.  "After the destruction ofArthurian, Ar-vegetal, the last king, fled to the Shire,where he sojourned for a time, and wogahed with one of themore bearable... er, lovely hobbit-wenches.  You are his mostdirect descendant.  When I come into my own, you will begiven the realms that should rightly be yours."     "I dinnae believe ye," said Sam, bluntly.     "Very vell," said Shelob.  "Suit yourself.  Don't ruleze Reunited Kingdom and eradicate injustice, usink yourpower to furzer ze Revolution.  Be a good serrvant and helpnice masterr."          "Search within your feelings; you know that what Isay is true.  Besides, would it not be better to be aninstrument of peace between me and Gondor?" urged Sauron."We have rather had our differences over questions likeuniversal healthcare, flush toilets, the relative musicalmerits of 'Casta diva' and 'When you wish upon a star,' andwho should own Dumbar, Land of the Flying Mûmaks. Not tomention the fact that Isildur stole Mini from me..." Onhearing the name "Mini," Shelob stuck a couple of pins intoa female voodoo doll.  Sauron laughed and tickled her bosom.     Sam was impressed.  "Stars and glory!" he cried."Universal healthcare! The Elves could mak a song aboonthat, if they heird of it -" ("And if they had any decentcomposers," murmured Sauron sotto voce.) "In the Shire,"continued Sam, "ye'd be lucky to get a Witch-doctor!"     "Just don't turn out like Gérard in Andrea Chénier,Sam," warned Sauron, nonplussing the hobbits (and possiblyseveral newsgroup posters).     "But does this mean we'll have to turn evil?" whinedFrodo.     Sauron laughed long and merrily.  "Evil?" he repeated."In what does said evil consist?  In providing universalhealthcare?  In being incredibly sexy, albeit in a sinister,Scarpia-like way? I have defended my own realm and itspeople against the genocidal Elven-caciques and Dúnedannarcoterrorists who sought to wipe out the Orcs.  Dogenocide and narcoterrorism not strike you as evil? My goal,on the other hand, is enlightenment and civilization.Indeed, my dream is to spread the glories of bel canto operato every corner of Muddle-earth."  He began to sing anobscure Donizetti aria in a voice of such beauty, thatSpiegel - along with every female Orc in the bulding -swooned, and Shelob began to kiss him passionately while hemassaged her lower and upper extremities.  "Rather thanbeing evil," he added, "I prefer to think of myself asambiguous, polyvalent, indeed intertextual."  He handedFrodo the book entitled Nymphomaniacs and their Ways: APorno-ethics of Existentiality.  "Take it," he said. "It'syours."     "Thank you, father!" said Frodo. "Now could I but wedFroufrou the Fish, I could die happy."     "We'll talk about that after the war," said Sauron."Or at least, after we've gotten rid of the phial. Youaren't really yourself just now, I realize," he sighed.After patting Frodo on the back, Sauron looked thoughtfulfor a moment.     "I did once send a plague of plastic white beagles withblack spots to Gondor, bewritten Get Mordor.  Itpays!" he mused.  "But that was just a prank.  Surely myplans to build an opera house in Minas Mickey prove mybenevolence."     "Sauron, your words are truth!" said Spiegel.  "May Ikeep your Blueprint for a New Order?" she begged.     "Take anything you wish, my sweet," replied Sauron, themellifluous cadences of his baritone filling Spiegel with amysterious thrill - or was it dread? Or was it lust?     Sam was silent for a while, pondering.  "Tell me, whatis Gandalf?" he asked at length.     "The subject is not a very pleasant one," repliedSauron. "In Valinor he got by mainly by cheating at poker,and by various other lies and machinations.  Here in Muddle-earth, his evil deeds continued unabated.  He was in the payof everyone (even me, occasionally; traitors can be useful),got involved in some disgusting genetic experiments which hecarried out on Denethor's wife Clarabella (sometimesrather rudely called 'the Cow'), and generally speaking isthe greatest danger to civilization that exists.  Until hemurdered Aruman, even I had no idea of just how evil he is."The hobbits were filled with horror, and resolved to joinSauron in his glorious struggle against evil.  Even Sam hadno more doubts.     "How can Gandalf be defeated?" asked Spiegel.     "It is difficult," said Sauron gravely.  "As long as hehas the Elf-ring, no power in Muddle-earth - not even mine -can overpower him.  Especially if you throw that ring inMount Viagra..."     "Ve can discuss zis furrzer later," said Shelob. "Veshould be gettink back to Barad-dûr. Zis is not ze safestplace to be discussink zese matters."     "You're right, my little Morgul-flower, whose blossomsunfold like a song of pure ecstasy," replied Sauron, rubbinghis hands all over her body.  "Come, friends!  We have muchto do.  The Morgai situation is getting serious."     Trusting wholly in Sauron and Shelob, the hobbitsgladly complied. As they went, Sauron sang:     Moreador, en garde!     Moreador, Moreador!     I'm a real wiseguy, the great Sauron     and rule the fates of Ard'!     And when we wogah Shelob turns me on,     she really turns me on!The hobbits caught their first glimpse of Mordor.  Sam andFrodo gazed upon the land with a horrible fascination, whileSpiegel looked upon it with understanding and love.  It wasa sight utterly unlike the aristocratically anarchic Shire,with its total lack of any concern whatsoever with a publicsphere independent of the private interests of the landedaristocracy and the rentiers that clung, leech-like, totheir shadow.  Still less did it resemble the tourist-riddensanitized but exploitative and other-denying commercialbanality of Gondor.  But before they could get a clearpicture of what it did resemble, their reveries wereinterrupted by a blast from the past that they could havelived without.     Suddenly they heard a dreadsome song, like unto anexhalation of pure evil, that Frodo and his companionsremembered only too well:     Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadildo!     You're in my way, so I'll have you killed-o!Mingled with this music of iniquity, they heard Boromirwhistling his battle-cry "Hi ho, hi ho!  Our home isNúmenor!" These deadly foes attacked the hobbits in thecompany of evil narcoterrorists.  On hearing the cry "Goons!Hired goons!" Sam lost consciousness from the force of theonslaught, and passed out of all knowledge.
        Sam awakened to find himself in bonds, gagged and tied to a tree.Not far away was Boromir, sharpening his sword and looking around.  Samstruggled against the gag, making unpardonable noises.        "Awake, sirrah?" boomed Boromir.  "'Tis a fair game hast played me.Wilt not try to bite me upon the shank like thy now-unconscious companion,wiltow?"  He pointed toward a similarly trussed Frodo.        Sam shook his head.  Boromir approached and removed the gag,allowing Sam to unleash a torrent of proletarian vituperation.        "Monarchist scum!  Untie me, or you'll live to see Gondor aSocialist Republic, and yourself lined up against the Wall with yourdeluded allies for your just retribution!"  He continued in that vein forquite a while.  Boromir laughed, but a little nervously, and continuedto pace and look through the trees.  They were, Sam guessed, in a glade ofEthelien, with its usual appurtenances of pond and babbling brook,somewhere to the east of Disgiliath.  At least, that was where he thoughthe had been when Sauron and Shelob had taken them Mordor-wards; the memorywas somewhat confused.        "Enough, halfling!" Boromir said after some time.  "I'll notdebate thy strange and decidedly post-medieval political views with thee.Know then, that thou hast been most foully deluded and cozened by the baselies of Sauron."        "Liar!" Sam flung back.  "I know for a fact that you're anarcoterrorist and an accomplice of Gandalf the Gruesome.  And I'mLenindil, the Heir of Isildur!"        "Sam, Sam!" Boromir laughed.  "Listen to thyself!  Wert thounot the champion of freedom from tyranny and exploitation by thearistocrats?  And here art thou claiming meaningless, archaic titles andeven glorying in them?  And associating me with Gandalf?  What next?Know that I have no interest other than that of Gondor and assortedfranchises.  Think about it, Sam.  Think about it."        Sam thought about it.  He thought of Sauron's promises of power.He thought of the Red Flag.  He thought of Annúminas.  He recalled thatAnnúminas was a draughty ruin.  He thought of the warm embraces ofRevolutionary Rosie.  "Kinko... Pinko... Pinko... Kinko..." he mumbled."But what about the opera?  Surely a cultured intellectual like Sauroncouldn't be up to no good..."        Boromir laughed scornfully.  "Opera?  Let me ask you, my goodSam, hast ever heard of Mario Lanza?"  Sam shook his head.  "Well, then,let me assure thee that opera may be Neanderthally lowbrow.  And what has acard-carrying member of the Hobbit Labour Party got to do withintellectuals anyway?"        Sam shook his head.  The lies of Sauron now seemed dull, false, andunbelievable.  He could not understand how he had ever been gulled.  "Verywell," he said slowly.  "I still think yer a right stinkin' monarchistsnob.  But I'll overlook that for now. What about Master, er, Mr. Frodo?"        "Hath babbled for hours about his 'Nurnenshire Estate', 'MoneybagsHall' and all that, until one of my Rangers -- NOT narcoterrorists, by anymeans -- swatted him on the occiput with his hilts.  He's yet more deludedthan thee.  But I'll release him, if you'll take him under your care."        "All right.  I'll be responsible for him."        "The third of your troop hath escaped us.  We broke the Orkishguard that escorted you out of Disgiliath; but in the mêlée your gangrelfriend departed."        "Er, which gangrel friend?"        "I saw but the one.  If there was another, it is doubtless stillwith the Orks."        "What about Sauron and Shelob?  Did they get away?" Sam asked.        "Sauron and Shelob?  Art mad, my friend?  Sauron abideth in theDark Tower in Mordor, hatching his evil plans.  Shelob I know not, but weslew nought but Orks."        "But I saw..." Sam began.  But as he tried to put words to hismemory, it became muddled and fragmented.        "You were deceived by the phantoms of Sauron, no doubt, that emergefrom the spiral depths of Minas Epcot and wend their way up and downEthelien.  Nay, Sauron will not emerge from the Dark Tower until all islost, and the Tower of Commerce is fallen.  But we must away.  The Orkshave only been driven off.  The longer we wait, the sooner they will beupon us.  We shall go down from the Crossroads to below Disgiliath, into aferry I have waiting there, and across the Anduin to Minas Tirith,where thou and thy Master shall be safe.  Arouse him!  For we must go."        Boromir released Sam's bonds, and Sam went over to Frodo.  He had abad bruise on the back of his head, and was breathing heavily.  "Mr. Frodo,Sir!" he called.  "Wake up, its your Sam, your own dear Sam, your dear,dear beloved true-hearted faithful Sam."        Frodo woke with a scream.  "Argh!  My Estates! My Estates!" hecried, and then collapsed back, sobbing.  "Don't let them take my Estatesaway, Sam!"  As Sam freed his legs, he jumped up and tried to run, butBoromir's Rangers blocked the way.        Sam grabbed Frodo's arm.  "We're stuck here, Mr. Frodo, and that'sa fact.  We might as well go with these gentlemen."        Frodo struck Sam's arm away.  "No!  They want my money, they do!My Estates!  My rightfully inherited Estates!  My precious Estates!  Theycan't have them, no indeed, no precious!"  He was panting hard at thispoint, and sweating; his eyes, swollen and reddened, bulged from hissockets.        Boromir growled.  "Thy 'Estates', as thou callest them," he said,"are nought but the merest paper.  There is no 'Nurnenshire'!  'Tis but avast, desolate wasteland!  As thou wouldst have found, had I not freed theefrom the clutches of the Mordor-Orks.  But thou art freed now, and soonshall be safe within the walls of Minas Tirith.        Frodo shivered and looked around him with the gaze of a hunted,cornered animal.  "Lies, all lies," he panted.  "I have Sauron's word onit.  I have the Deed!  Everything comes down to Contracts, and mine issigned and sealed!  It's my Estate, mine I tell you!"  His voice had becomea high-pitched whine.        Sam stepped up to him.  "Oh, Mr. Frodo," he said plaintively, "youcan always come back for your Estate later.  Now just follow these nicemen..."        Frodo spat at him.  "You.  You're in league with them!  Just as Ialways suspected.  Trying to get my money, aren't you.  Nice Sam, good Sam,clever Sam.  Always does what he's told, eh?  And why is Mr. Sam sodevoted?  Because he wants to pick Squire's pockets, that's why!  Dog!Thief!  Gamgee!"        He burst upon Sam with both fists, punching and scratching, whenthe heavy hand of a Ranger came down upon his shoulder and hauled him back.Frodo's teeth sank deep into that hand, and were only released when amailed glove came down upon his head.        "Seest how he is, Sam," said Boromir.  "Here, I think thouhadst better take this; thou shalt be the safer guardian."  He removed theRing from Frodo's neck and passed it to Sam.  But Sam was deep in tears.Frodo had rejected him!  His own, dear, sweet master Frodo had decided thatmoney -- real or imaginary, it mattered not --  meant more to him than dearSam.  Dear faithful Sam.  The ground was soon damp with his sobs.        "We'd best be onward, Lord," quoth a Ranger.  "Orks are a prowling.And where an Ork prowls, there hoot all the owls."        "Aye," said Boromir.  "And it's an ill wind that blows no oneany good."        With that the Orks came crashing through the trees, armed to theteeth with Lugers, Mausers, and all manner of automatic weaponry.  Theyaimed their fire at the tall people (whom they could see), giving Sam achance to hide in a fernbrake and cover the unconscious Frodo over withsome branches.  So Sam saw the whole massacre: Rangers falling or flying,while Boromir fought on with his hopelessly anachronistic sword andshield, until at last he fell with thirty bullets in the chest, and fellback into the pond, which at once turned a gruesome red.  So passedBoromir, best of the house of the Stewards to fail to rule in Gondor.        Sam stayed hidden until the Orks had gone.  The sun set and themoon rose.  Frodo woke, but Sam powered him to the ground and kept his handfirmly over his mouth.  A sound came from out toward the battlefield.        "Head bone connects to de neck bone, yess, neck bone connects tojuicy backbone, yes, backbone connects to scrumptious hip bone, yess, hipbone connects to meaty thigh bone, yum!"        "Gullible!" Sam called softly.  "Is that you?"        "Sss..." came the sibilant answer.  "Is that silly hobbits?  Stillchasing after imaginary Estatess?"        "No, we're over it," Sam replied.  "Or I am, anyway.  I don't knowabout Mr. Frodo. What happened to you?"        "We escapes, we does.  Runs away on fast feet with scampers andpampers!"        "Where's Spiegel?"        "Losst, lost, saddam.  But what does we care?  She betrays uswith Gorbush, precious."        Sam shrugged.  He had always been dubious about two people goingaround saying saddam all the time, and although one was bad enough, hesupposed he could live.  "Well," he said, "we'd better figure out a planfrom here.  We were going to take the Ring to Mt. Viagra, I think..."        "NO!"  The choking scream came from Frodo.  "You can't!  You'llsell us all out to Gandalf!"        "Ss, stupid hobbit," said Gullible.  "He is wrong to want theWogah-ring; steals precious bodily fluids, it does.  It should bedesstroyed!"        "That's two against one, Frodo," Sam replied cheerfully, surprisedto find Gullible on his side in the debate.  "So, are you with us, or do weneed to hogtie you with this excellent elven rope that I managed to bring100 ells of?  I thought I might need it, I did, or I'd be nowt but aninnyhammer, as my Gaffer used to say.  And that's a fact."        Frodo looked at Sam and Gullible hungrily.  A pale light gleamed inhis eyes.  "To Mordor?" he whispered.  "You're going to Mordor?   I cantake you there.  I know the way."  A thin smile played upon his features.        So the three hobbits set forth on the last leg of their journey toMordor.  Before them lay the great mountains of Ethel Duwap, and ahead ofthem the road led to the Enemy's citadel of Minas Goofy.  Minas Ethel longago, the former Tower of the Moonies had once seen mass marriages beyondcount.  But long since the Enemy had occupied it, and the Leech-king'shopelessly amateur tenor had rung throughout the long valley, filling itwith the sound of music.  On the topmost tower of Minas Goofy along-snouted, buck-toothed head topped with a shapeless cap still revolved,leering into the night.  Sam and Gullible stood aghast at the sight, butFrodo, apparently unmoved, pulled them forward.  They came to the bridgethat led into the valley toward the yawning gate of Minas Goofy; and Samfell reeling to his knees, as the sickly sweet scent of cotton candy thatrose from the fields about almost overwhelmed him.  "Not that way!" Frodohissed, and Sam shook off the horror and tottered after him.  They attaineda path that climbed up the side of the valley into the slopes of EthelDuwap.  But as they passed, a weariness as of a thousand exploited workersovercame Sam and Gulible, and they felt the need to rest.        "Not rest here!" said Frodo.  "Eyes can see us.  Must go on, andon, money awaits us, riches and power!"        "All right," said Sam quietly, "I'll try, Master."        But it was too late.  All of a sudden the rocks trembled, and withthe blast of ten thousand sousaphones, floodlights illuminated the wholevalley.  And out of Minas Goofy they came: the Army of Sauron, terribleupon the march.        All that host was clad in scarlet and cream, and there weredrummers, trumpeters, sousaphonists and saxophonists, baton twirlers, flagwavers, and Those who Marched in Step.  Rank upon rank they came forth, andthe Leech-king, brandishing a mighty baton, was at their head.  Frodosmiled, recalling that day long since, when the deed to Moneybags Hall hadbeen handed to him.        And Sam, beholding the red flags waving, thought that perhaps theRevolution had come.  His hand, as if obeying historical necessity, crepttoward the Ring around his neck.  Then his own will stirred, and his handsought and found another thing hidden near his breast: the Little Red Bookthat had been his constant companion on his adventures.  He sighed and benthis head.        'The storm has burst at last,' he thought.  'Now the Sauronitefascists are going to Disgiliath, to fight the Imperialists.  Damn theParty for voting for war credits!  A pox on both their houses.'  But deeperdown he remembered his ancient anti-fascism.        Then he heard Gullible's voice.  "Wake up, Ssam!   They're gone."And indeed the sound of sousaphones was fading down the road, and thefloodlights had been turned out.  Sam arose and, turning from the city ofGoofy, prepared to take the upward road.  Frodo, it seemed, had gone onahead, and now came back.  "Silly hobbits!" he said.  "Must go on, on andon, seek wealth and fame and fortune!"        So they proceeded, step by step.  A long stair lead them high upinto the alpine meadows of Ethel Duwap, where the edelweiss grew andalphorns sounded amidst the snowy peaks.  Up and up they climbed, until atlast, in the dead of night, they could see the horns of the chalet ofCirith Iodel.  A yellow light burned in the window of the chalet.        "Sss!  Tricksy hobbit!" hissed Gullible.  "Frodo cheats us, hedoes!  This way is guarded!"        Frodo shrugged.  "Could be," he said.  "Maybe it's least guarded.Who cares?"        "A long way yet," said Sam mournfully.  "I could use a good restand sleep."        They rested upon an flowered alpine carpet and built a fire andtoasted marshmallows.  The stars shone bright in the sky above them, as Samand Gullible sang old campfire songs that they found they both knew.  Afterthe third chorus of "Up in the Air, Junior Nazgûl," Sam said to Gullible,"You know, you're not such a bad sort after all.  I'll make sure to put ina good word for you when Mr. Frodo finally writes this story."        "And who will read this story, eh precious?" Gullible snickered.        "I don't know.  People will buy anything these days, as my Gafferused to say, bless his apophthegmatic soul.  If nothing else, MinasTirith could make it into a movie.  I'm the hero of course, and you'rethe cute talking animal with big eyes, but we'll need a villain.  Nowwhere's Master Frodo got to?"        They looked around.  Frodo was nowhere to be seen.  Sam sighed.  "Ishould keep a closer eye on him.  But he's got strange fancies these days.Still, we must humor him."        "Ss, no use worrying about him, no precious," said Gullible."Worry about us, yes!"  Sam found Gullible's gaze slightly unnerving, butalso endearing; he assumed that Gullible had moved into Stage #3 of theFive Stages of Sidekicking, i.e. Hero Worship.  "He's gone after hisEstates, yes, that's his whole plan: the Estates for poor Frodo."        "You're a cynic, Gullible," Sam laughed.  "Let's hope for the bestand prepare for the worst.  For all's well that ends better!"        When Frodo returned, he saw Sam and Gullible sleeping, Sam's headin Gullible's lap, Gullible's eyes closed and his hand caressing Sam'shair.  Frodo's shriek woke them both.        "Cheat!" he cried out.  "Wicked Sam cheats on us!  Whateverhappened to Faithful Sam!  And now I see you sleeping with -- yes, I saidsleeping with this wretch, this Gullible!  Nice Sam!  Loving Sam!Precious Sam!  Oooh!  I could just kill you!"        "Sorry," Sam said a bit remorsefully.  "But I wasn't sleeping withGullible, just resting, and he's taken rather a shine to me, so..."        "Don't even start," Frodo said angrily.  "I know the whole story.So it's my fault, is it?  Everything's always my fault.  Always blamepoor Frodo.  Very nice Sam, very nice."        "So where've you been, Frodo?"        "Cheating on you, just like you've been cheating on me."        "Oh well," replied Sam.  "I suppose it's not far from the truth.Well, let's go on.  Come on, Gullible."        "Yes, let's," Frodo said sniffily.  "You and Gullible.  Cheats.But you can't get there without me.  No time for rest.  Come along."        The hobbits climbed the slope, marching as straight as they couldtoward the comforting-looking lights of the chalet.  An easy slope led upbefore them, covered with soft green turf.  Gullible breathed in the sweetalpine air.  "Last one there's a rotten egg!" he cried and set off.  Samwas hot on his heels.  Only a little higher now.  The cleft, Cirith Iodel,was before them, a dim notch in the alpine ridge, and the chalet darklingagainst the sky.  A short race, a sprinter's course, and they would bethere!        But Sam was still digesting the marshmallows (of which he had eatenmost), and Gullible's legs were too fast for him.  As he slowed, panting,he felt a clammy hand over his mouth.  Taken off guard he toppled back intoFrodo's arms.        "Got him!" Frodo said.  "The so-called faithful Sam!  Don't think Ihaven't searched your pockets at night.  'Death to the Aristocrats'!  'Longlive the Revolution!'  We'll see about revolution when I'm esconced inMoneybags Hall.  Did you think you had me fooled?  You're nothing but asanctimonious liberal-leftist petty bourgeois armchair revolutionary. ButI've got you at last, you nasty filthy cheat!"        Armchair revolutionary.  Those words burned a fire in Sam's brainthat overcame his remembered love for Frodo and allowed him to fight back.A heel came up in Frodo's groin, and an elbow in his gut.  Frodo retchedand staggered back.  Sam was on him, punching and stomping.  "Had enough,pig?" he asked after he relented long enough for Frodo to catch his breath.But that was a mistake.        "Hey-yo-ee-oh!  Yo-ee-oh!"  A deafening yodel burst from Frodo'slips.  And out of the sky, rending the air like a butter-knife, came aNazdaq flying upon some strange Fierce Beast.  Frodo leaped up and graspeda claw, and the Nazdaq swooped away with him, leaving only a call thatechoed down the mountainside.  "So long, suckaz!"  Frodo's plot hadsucceeded.        Sam raised his head from the ground, weeping with anger.  Gulliblewas nowhere in sight.  The love for Frodo that had filled him had turned tohatred.  Now, at last, there was a real purpose for his lonely journey intothe land of Mordor.  Vengeance.  If once he could go, his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Frodo.  Then Frodo would die in a corner.  Yes, Sam mused to himself.  This was what he had set out to do.  It might not bring about the Revolution, but it would be uniquely satisfying.        Gullible came creeping back down the slope and found Sam there."Ssam dear," he said, "you'd better look at this."  Sam followed wearily.They came to the top of the ridge, where the chalet stood.        But there was only one wooden wall.  The chalet was a false front,the inviting yellow light seen from a distance just a single candle burningbehind an empty window.  And before them the alpine meadows ended.  On thefar side of the Ethel Duwap, the delightful music-filled glades droppedinto sheer, slaty precipices.  Far below Sam could see the vast parkinglots of the Mall of Gorgoroth and Lithlad Station; their asphalt surfacesstretched to the horizon.  In the gloom, no trace of the Dark Tower orMount Viagra could be seen.  Sam clenched his hands into fists and glaredinto the distance.  Somewhere out there was Frodo: alive, and taken in bythe Enemy.

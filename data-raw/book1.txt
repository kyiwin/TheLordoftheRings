     "So you're going to go through with it, then," Gandalf the Wizard said slowly.     "I am," Bilbo replied. "I've been planning this for a long time. It'll give the Hobbits of the Shire something to talk about for the next nine days - or ninety-nine, more likely. Anyway, at least I'll have my little joke."     "Who will laugh, I wonder?" Gandalf mused aloud, scratching his beard idly.     For weeks carts and caravans were coming from all over Middle-earth to bring provisions for the Grand Old Party, as Bilbo referred to it. Wagons of food from the Dwarvish mines at Erebor, shiny rocks from the Sea-elves and fancy seductive packages from southern Mirkwood arrived daily, making the neighborhood generally more crowded and cluttering up avenues. Even those who hadn't said anything bad about Bilbo before were starting to show their annoyance. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is starting to get a mite annoying," old Gaffer Gamgee grumbled, standing outside the pub. "Queer goings-on, and no mistake. Why just yesterday a bunch o' pesky Wood-elves dragged their cart right acrost my yard and ruined my taters!"     "A bunch of Men from Bree came to my place yesterday and tried to sell me some aluminum siding," mused Old Noakes of Bywater. "They said it was because they had extra after building that horrible Quonset hut over the Party Tree, and they were trying to unload it. Strange folk hereabouts."     "Yes, but it's good for the economy," sneered Bill Ferny, the local banker. "A lot more money in circulation. Market's been doing well. Unionization is down because of all the entry-level service positions that are being created. Widening gap between the haves and have-nots, don't you think? Good to find work for idle hands."     "And you don't know nothin' about anythin', Ferny," Gaffer Gamgee snapped, echoing the popular community sentiment. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is a right bastard, as I've often said, and it's small wonder if trouble don't come of him and his imperialist ways. The Revolution's a'comin', and it's the likes o'you who'll be the first ag'inst the wall, so sayeth the Lord." And with that he spat a well-aimed beer-nut into Ferny's glass.     At last the day of the Big Party arrived. Everywhere there was too much to eat, and by midafternoon there were broken presents lying all over the Shire attesting to the low quality of their manufacture. Gandalf set off a series of fireworks later on in the day, including great skywriting missiles and little flaming butterflies who took to wing, sailed off into the Eastfarthing and burned all its trees to the ground.     The last firework sent up a great black smoke which took the shape of a giant mountain of fire. A flicker could be seen of a giant dragon sailing about its peak; after a moment the great dragon went sailing over the heads of the crowd, causing great panic and consternation and six outright heart attacks before imploding somewhere over the Sackville-Baggins' neighborhood, causing considerable property damage which was never properly repaired for generations afterward.     "That is the signal for supper!" Bilbo cried out to the survivors, who were only partly mollified.     Later on, in the specially-designed quonset hut which Bilbo had built especially for the occasion, all his friends and neighbors were helping themselves to their third helpings of macaroni and cheese and potato salad (the latter laced liberally with what Bilbo called the "traditional secret ingredient", which while not actually a narcotic still had unusual effects, the sum of which were still under scientific inquiry in some circles), Bilbo stood up and motioned for quiet. "A speech! A speech!" some of his neighbors cried out in fear.     My dear Hobbits! Bilbo began. There was much cheering at this, as Hobbits on the whole are a rather egocentric lot, and anyway the latest round of potato salad was beginning to kick in.     My dear Bagginses and Bracegirdles, Boffins and Borfledebees, Casmits and Cantankerums, Fassbinders and Fazoolas, Wombats and Wafflefoots. "WaffleFEET!" cried out an irate old man at the back, in fact the very man who had earned the name when Bilbo's nephew Frodo had accidentally dropped a hot waffle-iron on his feet some years ago. He had borne the Bagginses no ill-will, since the settlement was quite generous.     Wafflefoots, continued Bilbo, oblivious. This is my nine hundreth birthday! And though one million years is too short a time to have spent with you all...     There was some muffled conversation throughout the hall, which Bilbo took notice of. Well, on bad days it seems like a million years, he explained. Anyway, though ten billion years is long enough to endure from all of you, this is IT... I am GOING... I am leaving NOW... GoodBYE! And with that Bilbo leaped up, tore all his clothes off, scattering them about the astonished guests' heads, and ran from the great Hut screaming and flailing his arms.     Young Frodo looked on in bemusement, refusing to answer questions from the astonished crowd. Everyone knew, of course, that Bilbo was a big man in the community. But - and Frodo looked at the crowd, particularly noting the astonishment on old Lobelia's face - until now, nobody knew just how big.     "Well! That's done!" Bilbo laughed, emerging from the bedroom at Bag End freshly dressed. "You know, Gandalf, I've been wanting to do that for as long as I can remember. Now I think this would be an excellent time to leave the Shire, at least before they can all find their torches and axe-handles. Everything stays with Frodo, as we promised."     "Including the Ring?" Gandalf asked.     "Well, yes, I suppose so," Bilbo replied. He pulled the Ring out from under his cloak, where it hung on a fine golden chain Bilbo had stolen of old from the Brandybucks. "Still, though, I kind of hate to get rid of it."     "This seemed to me to be the only thing worthwhile about your whole stupid plan," Gandalf said uncharacteristically. "Put it on the mantel and walk away from it. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!"     "It's mine! And I shall keep it, I say!"     Gandalf raised himself up to his full height. Bilbo's hand reached quietly for the hilt of his sword. "It will be my turn to get angry soon," the wizard intoned. "Listen to me: you must give Frodo the Ring!"     Bilbo suddenly laughed. "Oh, that?" he grinned. "Well, of course I'm giving him the Ring! I thought you meant the chain." Slipping the Ring off the chain he set the circle of gold on the mantel without a second thought. Then he slipped the chain about his neck. "I love this chain. Stole it from old Matuseck Brandybuck back before he went senile. Wouldn't part with it for love nor money. No, I don't give two flies about the Ring. Nothing but trouble, that thing has been.     "Well, I'm off, Gandalf! I'm off on the road again, and not a moment too soon by the look of that crowd down there." And taking an old walking-stick from the stand by the door Bilbo went outside, taking a path around the back of the Hill so he could leave unobserved, and as he left he began singing a song quietly to himself:      While often by the door I lie      And look upon the mountains' feet      And think of rains and hikers' pains      And sleeping wetly in the sleet,      When darkness' cry does terrify      And wilderness encircles you,      And being food for goblins' brood      Is one choice, and starvation two;      Then staying home instead of roam      Will have a very great appeal!      Forego the Quest! And have a rest!      Let Dwarves and Elves and wizards squeal!      But since the Shire is filled with ire,      And all my neighbors fevers grip,      It's plain to see! I must agree!      The time has come to take a trip!     Hours later Frodo returned to Bag End, a little glad to have thrown off the pursuit at last. He started at first to discover someone waiting for him in the living-room, but sighed with relief when he saw it was only Gandalf.     "Did he get away?" Frodo asked.     "He did," Gandalf replied. "And just at the last, for they were getting ready to set after him with dogs. Luckily he doubled back at the Three-Farthing Stone, as I recommended, or there would be a special bonfire in Tuckborough tonight. Are you well?"     "Yes," Frodo replied. "I managed to convince everyone I was uninvolved with the Hay Incident."     "Good," Gandalf said. He lit his pipe with a nearby candle and looked at Frodo evenly. "He left things for you on the mantel. The deed to Bag End, a signed statement saying you were only an unwitting accomplice in the Bywater Incident, and-"     "The Ring!" Frodo said, looking at the mantel with astonishment. "Has he left me that?"     "He has," Gandalf replied, "though you'll have to find a new chain. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own - don't use it! Now or later! It may have other powers besides quick and easy seduction."     "I can't believe Bilbo left me the Ring," Frodo gasped. "He used to say that it and a bottle of Westfarthing Chinook was all you needed for the perfect weekend."     "Well, lock it up someplace and stay away from it," Gandalf intoned. "No Took-wives, no Elf-virgins, and no real estate deals. And no political aspirations! In the morning I'm off to see if I can learn more about it. In the meantime leave it unused until I return."     "I'll, uh, I'll think about that, all right," Frodo blurted, trying hard not to think about the Ring and young Cassiopiea Took.     The next morning Gandalf left, leaving Frodo with only his thoughts, his yearnings and a half-empty bottle of Westfarthing Chinook for company.
  The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. Indeed, thestory of Banger Baggins, who used to run around naked at night and ravishyoung maidens, became a favourite story, not least among those who could laya claim to belonging to that category. Frodo, however, remained wed tocelibacy. He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends,especially among the younger hobbits. His closest friends were PipsqueakTook and Moribund ("Morrie" or "the Mobster") Brandybuck, one of themfriendly and willing if somewhat pimply, the other as cold as ice and asruthless as a society hostess. Not for nothing were Morrie and his familyfeared throughout the Shire, even by the Shirriffs though those were all onthe Brandybuck paylist.  Frodo enjoyed being his own master and the Mr Baggins of Bag End. Helived on quietly, increasing his inherited fortune through wise investmentsand high-interest loans which earned him the nickname of "Sharkey", untilhis fiftieth birthday drew near. Then Gandalf turned up again. Frodowelcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard atone another.  "You are becoming grossly fat, Frodo," said Gandalf. "Luckily, I have somereally good exercise in store for you."  "You are too kind," murmured Frodo. "Please don't exert yourself on mybehalf."  "I'm afraid I have to," replied the wizard. "That ring of yours - do youstill have it?"  "Yes, of course," said Frodo. "I would gladly get rid of it; every timeI've tried it on I kept stumbling over my own invisible feet since I couldnot see them. I wish I had never accepted the pesky thing. Will you not takethe ring, Gandalf!"  "No!" cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. "That ring would bugger up myspells completely. No, no, I refuse! But I can give you some advice abouthow to get rid of it, if you want."  "What is that?" demanded Frodo.  "Take it to Mordor and drop it in the Cracks of Doom," said Gandalf. "Ifyou don't, Sauron will come and take it. And you don't want him to do that;he gets pissed off at people who have touched his precious ring." He lit acigar. "But if you put an end to the ring, you off Sauron too. The littledimwit infused so much of himself in the ring that his destruction with itis certain."  "But I remember how you once told me that Sauron thought the ring had beendestroyed."  "I did. He thought it had been thrown into the Cracks of Doom, as shouldhave happened. Now, however, he knows that it isn't so."  "But how can he have thought any such thing? If the ring had beendestroyed he wouldn't have been around; so he should have realized that thering had not been destroyed."  "As I told you, he is a dimwit. He really is incredibly stupid.All thesame, there was a scholarly article in The Minas Tirith Review about theRing yesterday, written by the learned Dr Faramir. Sauron must have readthat article; he subscribes to an excellent newscutting agency. Hisemissaries may be on their way to the Shire at this very moment."  "I had better leave at once," said Frodo.  "I agree," said Gandalf. Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo becameaware that all was very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to oneside of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust along arm out as if to catch somebody. Then his movement stopped. Hestraightened up and snorted.  "No one has been eavesdropping," he said. "Excellent. You'd better leaveas soon as possible, Frodo. Take that servant of yours, Sam, with you. Helooks like a sturdy lad and might come in useful."
  Despite Frodo's resolution to leave at once, he was in truth veryreluctant to start, now that it had come to the point.  One afternoontwo or three weeks after Gandalf's warning (or maybe four, or perhapsjust one; Frodo spent most of the days that followed drunk, and ratherlost track of time), Frodo went to the wizard for advice.  "Gandalf,"he asked, voice filled with concern, "I can't just vanish without atrace.  After Bilbo's farewell stunt, I'd never be able to look theold hobbit in the eye again if I didn't keep up the family tradition.Like father, like son, you know."  Gandalf, confused, said, "Father?  What are you talking about?Bilbo was your first and second cousin, once removed either way... Ishould know, I had to sit through two and a half hours of old GafferGamgee's genealogy lectures at the party.  Seating me next to him wasone of Bilbo's little jokes."  "Oh, well, you know," Frodo fumbled, "Bilbo did have the Ring andall, and my mother was quite comely when she was a lass... the wholething has been discussed before, though not generally in politecompany.  I'd rather not talk about it.  And anyway, this isn'tgetting me any closer to an excuse to leave."  "Don't worry, Frodo," replied Gandalf.  "I thought you might proveto be hesitant, so I've taken some steps of my own to provide for asuitably ignominious departure for you."  Just as Frodo gave Gandalf a sharp, suspicious look, a hammeringsound came down the hall from the front door.  "What in the heavens isthat?" cried Frodo.  "Unless I miss my guess," Gandalf explained, "those will be yourcreditors.  I took the liberty of closing your bank accounts andtaking out a number of short term loans in your name from some of yourcompetitors in the 'Sharkey' business.  As I recall, they come duetoday.  Incidentally, I've got to be off to, er, scout out the roadahead, so I'll just slip out and catch up with you later.  Look for mein Bree!"  And with that, the old wizard dashed off and was gone.  Frodo leapt out of his chair in a panic, as the hammering on thedoor became more insistent.  "What have you done with my money?" heyelled in the direction Gandalf had run, but he knew that chasing thewizard would only waste valuable escape time.  Fortunately, Pipsqueakand Morrie were visiting for the day, accompanied by Pipsqueak'sannoying younger brother Fatty, and Sam was back in the cellar doingsome unspecified repairs.  Quickly, Frodo rounded up his friends andexplained the situation.  "The Sackville-Baggins 'family' is here to take everything they canget their grubby hands on," Frodo explained, "and that includes me andall of my friends.  We'd better clear out in short order if we don'twant to end up at the bottom of Bywater Pool.  Quickly, now, runthrough the hole and grab everything valuable that isn't bolted down:the thought of the Sackville-Bagginses getting a hold of my thingsmakes me sick, and anyway, I'll be broke if we don't pile up some ofthis loot before we go."  Quickly the five hobbits scattered throughout the hole, filling oldpillow cases with whatever they could carry.  Frodo had a strong door,but now the pounding gave way to a repeated ramming sound; he knewthey didn't have much time.  He met Pipsqueak, Morrie, and Fatty inthe study as they had agreed: it was on the lefthand side of the hall(going in) like all the best rooms, for these were the only ones tohave windows large enough for a desperate hobbit to climb out in anemergency.  After a tense minute's delay, Frodo shouted back into thehole.  "Sam!" he called.  "Sam!  Time!"  "Coming, sir!" came the answer from far within, followed soon by Samhimself, wiping his mouth.  "I was just saying farewell to Rosi--um,the beer-barrel in the cellar."  Frodo looked down at Sam's hand.  "Give me that Ring," he snapped,as he yanked the ancient artifact off of Sam's finger.  With that,they all scrambled out of the window along with their bags of loot.Just at that moment, a great crash came from the hall as the doorfinally gave way.  "Sam," said Frodo once they were outside, "take this key to yourfather, and tell him to hold on to it.  We're going need it when wecome back for revenge.  Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick asyou can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows.  We are not goingthrough the village tonight.  Too many ears pricking and eyes prying."Sam ran off at full speed, while Frodo and the others loaded the cartthat Morrie had fortunately brought along that morning.  The sun went down.  Sad and frightening sounds came from within BagEnd in the dark, as the Sackville-Bagginses wrecked and looted theplace in their search for Frodo.  Once the cart had been hastilypacked, Frodo sent Morrie and Fatty with it on ahead.  Morrie was,as a rule, terrible company on a hike, and Fatty was a hundred timesworse.  "Sam and Pipsqueak and I will meet you at the safehouse inCrickhollow the day after tomorrow," he said, and they drove away asquietly yet quickly as they could.  Frodo looked back at the dark black windows of Bag End, some ofwhich were being smashed out as he watched.  One of the windows nearthe cellar seemed to have a ripped piece of a hobbit lass's dress tornand fluttering on a nail. He waved his hand to his long home."Good-bye!" he said, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he hadknown it) hurried after Pipsqueak down the garden path.  Taking themost secret route they knew, they jumped over the low place in thehedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the blessedconcealment of darkness like a cattle rustler into the grasses.  They met Sam at the gate, and proceeded along the deserted lane fora mile or two, at which point they cut off into the fields to throwoff pursuit.  After some time they crossed the Water, and made theirway toward the hilly country to the south.  "Well, I'll say this,"remarked Frodo as he looked back into the valley of Hobbiton and backto the Hill, where tiny flames had begun to rise from the vicinity ofBag End, "that was quite an exit.  I wonder if I'll ever be able toshow my face in that valley again?"  Sam and Pipsqueak were walking onahead exchanging dirty stories, and Frodo's question went unanswered.  The three friends walked on and on into the night.  Eventually, themoon set, and after Pipsqueak nearly fell into a deep streambed forthe third time, the hobbits agreed that they should stop where theywere and sleep for the night.  Of course, none of them had thought totake any bedding with them on the trip, so they all curled up on topof the tree roots nearby, ignoring the soft, comfortable bed offir-needles that covered the ground beyond the roots.  They set nowatch: they had drawn lots, but when Frodo and Sam noticed Pipsqueakcheating they all decided it was a lost cause and went to bed.  A few creatures came and looked at them as they slept.  A foxpassing through the wood on business of his own stopped severalminutes and sniffed.  "Hobbits!" he thought.  "And sleeping out ofdoors under a tree at that.  There's something mighty queer behindthis.  I'd better head off to tell my friends Bombadil, Gandalf, andEl Rond all about it in short order.  Good thing I can speak Westron."  The next morning came, pale and clammy.  The three friends went onwalking through the trees, and Frodo began to chant to himself in alow voice:     The Road goes ever on and on,     and on and on and on and on,     and on and on the Road has gone,     why did I let Morrie drive the cart?Sam and Pipsqueak stopped and gave Frodo an odd look, but when hedidn't respond they all went on their way, deeper into the wood.  The sun was beginning to get low and the hobbits had just passedinto a stand of beech trees when they heard hoofbeats on the roadbehind them.  "Quick!" whispered Frodo, staring back the way they hadcome.  "They must have found our tracks sooner than we thought.  Hidebehind the trees!"  He turned back around, and realized that hisfriends hadn't needed his advice: they had already run a good waysinto the wood and buried themselves under a pile of leaves.  Frodohimself only had time to duck behind a nearby statue of a Pukel-manwhen a tall black horse came into view.  On it sat a large black man, wearing a dark, dark grey cloak andhood.  When the horse reached the statue level with Frodo it stopped,and the black man started looking from side to side, breathingheavily.  A light breeze blew in Frodo's direction, and Frodo caught awhiff of a terrible smell like last Easter's missing egg.  He gagged,and the black man stared toward his hiding place and began to climboff of his horse.  But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song andlaughter.  The black man started to tap his foot, then hum along withthe music.  Finally, he started singing out loud, and then suddenlyrealized what he was doing.  He got an extremely sheepish look on hisface, leapt up on his horse, and rode away in utter embarrassment.  "Elves!" exclaimed Sam, coming with Pipsqueak to Frodo's side."Elves, sir!"  Frodo nodded, and as the voices drew nearer, their songbecame clearer:     O! What are we doing,     And where are we going?     We're soon barbecuing!     The river is flowing!       O! tra-la-la-lally         up out of the valley!     O! What are we seeking,     And where are we making?     The faggots are reeking!     The bannocks are baking!       O! tril-lil-lil-lolly         the vally was jolly,            ha! ha!Well, okay, not that much clearer, but Elves are like that.Nevertheless, Sam stood enchanted.  "Is it true, Mr. Frodo, that Elveshave drugs the like of which no mortal has ever known?  It certainlysounds like it."  Frodo answered, with awe but not without disappointment.  "Yes, Sam.These are, indeed, High Elves.  Sadly, they share not their preciousdrugs with outsiders.  Still, they can be good company, and they surethrow a great barbecue."  As the Elves drew near, Frodo stepped out into the path.  "Elen silalumenn' omentielvo!" he said in his most friendly tones.  The Elves appeared confused.  "What do you mean, Frodo, that yoursister has a wombat through her tea-time?"  Frodo cursed under hisbreath, and swore a silent oath to himself never to trust Bilbo'slanguage lessons again.  The Elf went on, "No matter.  You look wearyand hungry; would you like to come with us to dinner?"  "Certainly, good people," replied Frodo greatfully, for the dinnerinvitations of the High Elves are rare and prized indeed, "but how doyou know my name?"  "We have watched you long," they laughed, "and your father Bilbobefore you."  At this, Frodo winced, but they took no notice. "Youradventures with that young Cassiopiea Took were quite amusing, and asfor Bilbo, well..." Frodo was now blushing furiously, and the Elves(together with Sam and Pipsqueak) simply laughed again and said nomore.  They passed on into the night, until they came to a clearing inthe wood.  In the clearing, there stood a ring of great upright standingstones, connected from top to top with other great stone slabs allaround the circle.  "Welcome to Sto-wan-hensh, our hall of feasts,"said Gildor, the leader of the Elves.  "You are fortunate: it isalmost time for supper."  Even as Gildor spoke, an Elf sighting along two tall stones criedout, "The stars are now in place!  It's ten o'clock; soup's on!"Torches and bonfires leapt into life all around the stone circle, andsoon the entire company was happily eating barbecued fox and toastedcornbread.  A large flat stone in the center of the ring had beenscrubbed clean, and was surrounded by blazing fires that heated italmost until it glowed; an Elf was frying bacon on its top.  Thehobbits tried not to feel disappointed when the High Elves didn'toffer them any miruvor when it was passed around, but other thanthat the evening was perfect.  Frodo soon decided to share some of his fears and concerns withGildor as they ate.  "Gildor, what would a black man be doing in theShire?  We were pursued by one today, and he only left when he heardyour company approach."  "A black man?  In the Shire?" said Gildor doubtfully.  "I have neverheard of such a thing, not since the old days of the Kings and theirbattles with Angmar.  Just about everyone in this part of the world isCaucasian, and that's a fact."  "And yet," explained Frodo, "he was there, and I was frightened.I've never been comfortable around minorities."  From the background, Pipsqueak spoke up, "Be sure to tell him about thesmelling!  I'm sure it is very important!"  "Well," Frodo said to Gildor, "he did have this awful odor..."  Gildor cut Frodo off sharply.  "Hold it right there.  This story isracist enough as it is; we don't need any comments about 'BlackBreath' making it worse."  "Right.  We'll drop the subject," said Frodo.  "Nevertheless, I ampursued, even before I have left the Shire.  I am supposed to meetGandalf in Bree, but I don't know how I'll even make it that far, orwhat to do if he isn't there.  I'm at a loss, I'm frightened, and I'mbearing a terrible burden on which may rest the fate of allMiddle-earth.  Can you give me any advice?"  "No.  Yes." said Gildor.
	In the morning Frodo awoke refreshed.  He was lying in a bower made bya living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground;  his bedwas of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant.  The scentwas almost intoxicating and Frodo was dizzy with light-headedness.  Hejumped out and went down.	Sam was sitting in the grass near the edge of the wood quietly gigglingto himself.  Pipsqueak was standing studying the sky with open mouthedawe.  There was no sign of the Elves.	"They have left us some fruit and drink, and bread," said Pipsqueak. "Come and have your breakfast.  The bread tastes strange, butwonderful!  I didn't want to leave you any, but Sam thought it might doyou some good."  At this the hobbits laughed under their hands at Frodo.	Unperturbed, Frodo sat and sampled some of the Elves' bread.  It wasbrown and sweet and had an unusual peppery tang that he couldn'tidentify.  Sam came and sat by him as he broke fast.  "What's the planfor today?" asked Pipsqueak.	"To walk to Bucklebelt as quickly as possible," answered Frodo, andgave his attention to the food.  Odd as it was, it seemed to make himfeel better and better.	"Do you think we'll see those Riders?" asked Pipsqueak cheerfully. Under the Elven bread's spell, a whole troop of Black Riders did notseem so alarming to him.	"Yes, probably," said Frodo, "but I hope to get across the riverwithout their seeing us."	"Did you find out anything from Gildor?"	"No, not really."	"Did you ask about the smell?"	"We didn't discuss it," said Frodo with small embarassment.	"You should have. I am sure it's terribly important!"	The hobbits eyed Pipsqueak for a moment before they all broke out intopeals of laughter that they did not understand.	"My," gasped Frodo after regaining some control over his mirth, "thisis fine bread!"	They soon broke camp and started again their long trek.  After a while,Frodo called a halt and the Hobbits discovered that they had walked toofar to the south.  After some small debate, they made straight East intoa wood that offered some shelter against the coming rain.  As theymarched, Sam thought he caught a glint of steel in the distance andstopped short.  As he turned his head to look, Sam could have sworn hesaw an elf-maid heavily armed and camoflauged peering from behind a bushat him, but when he blinked, nothing was there.	"What's the matter, Sam?" asked Pipsqueak.	"What? Oh, nothing master Pipsqueak, sir.  Just the rain playing trickson me, I suppose.  I could use a rest for a bit, and that's a fact."	To this they all agreed and made for the shelter of a majestic Elm.	Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pipsqueak sat near, and they began to hum, and then to singsoftly:				Yo!  Ho!  Ho!  and a bottle of rum!		Fifteen men on a dead man's chest,		The cabin-boy and Cap'n, an outrage to some.		But me Parrot on me shoulder, he's the best.		An the scurvy dogs a lyin' in davy Jones' locker		Will rise at the latter day - oh what a shocker!Yo! Ho! Ho! they began again louder.  They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet.  A long-drawn wail came down the wind, likethe cry of some fell and lonely creature: (heh) (hehhehehheh) (snicker) (SLAP) (SPANK) (heh) (heheh) (heheheh) (snicker) (heh) (Bwwwaaaahahahahahahaa!) (heheheh) (..........heh)  It rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note.  Even as they stood, it was answered by another cry fainter and further off, but no less blood-chilling.	"What do you think that was?" asked Pipsqueak in a terrified voice. "That weren't no bird I ever heard."	"It wasn't any bird or beast," said Frodo, "There were words in thatcry, though I could not catch them." 	No more was said and the Hobbits quickly gathered their gear and movedon through the woods.  Very soon they came to a clearing and beyond tofields planted with poppy and a strange variety of mushroom.	"I know these fields!" cried Pipsqueak.  "We've wandered farther souththan we thought.  These are Michel Delving's fields."	"Who's that?" asked Sam.	"I'm sorry. You'd know him better as Farmer Maggot, I think."	"One trouble after another," said Frodo.  "I've been horribly afraidof Farmer Maggot ever since he caught me trying to steal some of hismushrooms as a lad.  He beat me and then showed me to his wood shed. 'See, lads,' he said, 'next time this varmint sets foot on my land, youcan eat him.  Now see him off!'  They chased me all the way to the ferryand I've never got over the fright!"	"Well, it's time you made it up, then, cousin," said Pipsqueak andheaded off across the fields.	"Don't you worry, master," said Sam, "I won't let no one beat you thistime, and that's a fact."  Frodo screwed up his courage and set afterthem, to what doom he knew not.	Suddenly, as they drew nearer to the farm-house, a terrific groaningand grating broke out, and a loud voice was shouting, "Twig!  Branch!Elm!  Come on, lads!"	The hobbits stopped dead and very soon the gate opened and three hugelogs came rolling out into the lane and dashed towards the travellers,barking fiercely.  They took no notice of Pipsqueak but two of themcornered Sam and looked at him in a way that can only be described aswoodenly.  The largest and fiercest of the logs halted in front ofFrodo, bristling and growling in a deep timbre.	Through the gate came the largest man any of the hobbits ever saw."Hallo!  Hallo!  And what may you be wanting?" he asked.	"Good afternoon, Mr Delving," said Pipsqueak.	The farmer looked at him closely. "That's Maggot to you, masterPipsqueak - Mr Paragraph Took, I should say!" he cried with relief. "It's been a long while since I saw you about these parts.  It's a goodthing I recognised you; I was about to set my logs on you after thequeer vistor I had this morning."	"Who would that be, Mr Maggot?" asked Frodo.	"You didn't see him?  He left not half an hour ago.  All dressed inBlack he was and as foul smelling a customer as you could hope to meet. Came riding right through my poppies, he did, and right up to my doorbold as you please. 'This path don't lead no where,' I said to him, 'yourbest way is straight back to the road.'	"'I'm looking for Baggins,' he hissed at me.  	"'Who are you?' says I.	"'Ummmmm.....'	"'Your name's "M"?'	"'Yeeeessss, that's right, my name's M.  Now will you tell me ifBaggins comes?  I will bring gold!' he said.	"'Oh no, you won't,' I said.  'You'll bugger off back the way you cameand double quick!  You can use the path this time.'  I set the logs ontohim but he struck a match and they shied away even as he stormed outright over my poppies again!  Now then, Pipsqueak, who're yourcompanions?"	"Well, this is Sam and that's Frodo Baggins," said Pipsqueak.	"Well, if that isn't queerer than ever.  You best come inside," saidMaggot and waved his arm for them to follow him.	Later, they all passed the news while waiting for Mrs Maggot to finishpreparing dinner.  Frodo and Sam learned much about Mr Maggot and hisdoings.  He told them that the guard logs were given to him by hisbrother who lived in the enchanted part of the old forest (or 100 acrewood as it is known in latter days) and told them also of his dealingswith the Elves and their lust for the distillation made from his poppiesknown as Morofeen that brought Mr Maggot most of his business thesedays.	"Haven't seen much of old Bombadil in a long time though," Maggot said,"lives in the old forest, too, he does.  Used to buy my mushrooms by thebushel-full, but now with all the ill news and all, I can hardly pushoff my special 'shrooms to the Hobbit teens down Bucklebelt way."	Then the table was set with all the hobbits could eat, and thecenterpiece was a large bowl of steamed mushrooms.	"I'm sure our master Frodo still has a liking for mushrooms, Idaresay," jibed Maggot.	"How did you..."	"Oh, I remember you all-right, Mr Baggins!"  A cough from Sam drewattention.	"I'm afraid Sam has heard about your beating me and is a little wary ofyou, Mr Maggot," put in Frodo quickly, secretly waving Sam into closinghis flick-knife.	"Well, I'm sorry I beat your master, Sam, but he oughtn't have thievedmy mushrooms.  Least of all those kind.  Only for special customers Igrow them.  Cost me a bundle, your Mr Frodo did, and right sick he wouldhave been, too, if he'd've eaten them.  No, these mushrooms are betterfor you and me!"  said Maggot digging another spoonful of butteryfungus onto his plate.	After a respite and a further dinnner and another respite, Mr Maggotoffered to take the travellers to the Bucklebelt ferry in his cart toavoid any strangers waiting to waylay them on the road.  When all wasprepared and the cart loaded, it was well after dark and Frodo worriedthey might miss the last ferry and Morrie both.  But his fears wereeased when after the hobbits climbed aboard the cart and were hiddenunder a tarpaulin, Mr Maggot lifted mightliy on the two levers and setoff at a great pace down the road.  They were bumped and bruised as thecart's single wheel endeavored to find every crack and rock in the road,or so it seemed to Frodo.	To break the agony of their journey, Frodo slipped on the ring andcalled in a cooing voice, "Ohhhhh Saaaammmm. Sammy SammySammm-Saammmm.."	"Now cut that out, Mister Frodo!  It not funny trying to get me all hotand bothered just so's you can laugh at me, and that's a fact!"  Samspat indignantly.	"Oh, Sam, I'm only having you on.  No need to be upset." said Frodo.	"Well as long as you're not trying to have it off with me, we'll getalong just fine, and that's a fact!"	"Do you end all your sentences with and that's a fact?" askedPipsqueak.	"I don't know what you mean, Mister Pipsqueak, and that - "  Thehobbits rolled with laughter for the rest of their trip.	An hour later they felt a sharp bump as Mr Maggot dropped his loadheavily.  They could hear him whispering to someone on the road.	"Don't you come a step nearer, missy!  Who are you and what do youwant?"  There were sounds of a struggle and then a sharp high-pitchedyell followed by the sound of something large being dropped into theriver.  Soon, Mr Maggot opened the make-shift cover concealing thehobbits and bade them get out.	"What happened, Mr Maggot?" asked a very worried Frodo.	"Well, there was this queer looking lady in the road holding up thebrightest sword ever I saw.  I went up to her and her face was paintedall green and brown like.  She's an elf if ever I saw one, but why shelooked so fearsome, I do not know.  Anyway, she takes a swing at me withher sword, but missed her mark, so I gave her a shove just to learn herwho her betters are, but I shoves too hard and wouldn't you know -straight over the side of the Bridge she drops right in the water.  Ilooked for her and thought of calling you all out to help me, but shedisappeared just as any frog might do.  No sign of her now, though."	As he was finishing his tale, the sound of hoof-beats approached andthey all were relieved to see Morrie riding up across the bridge tomeet them.	"There you are, Frodo!" he cried "I was worried when you didn'tarrive by nightfall, so I came looking for you.  Hallo, Mr Maggot!"	"Good Ev'nin to you, master Moribund!  Well, I'll leave you all now andget myself home.  I hope you'll stop travelling and settle down, MrFrodo, now you're here with us."	"Thank you," said Frodo, "and thanks for all your kindness."	"Well," he said after Maggot had gone a fair distance, "what are wewaiting for?  Let's get to the ferry."	"Begging your pardon, Mr Frodo, sir,"  said Sam, "It seems to me wecould cross just as well by this here bridge, if you take my meaning."The hobbits' blank expressions showed they clearly did not.  "Why can'twe just cross here the way Mr Morrie did and save ourselves some timeand maybe trouble of another sort?  We'd be a dead target for thatelf-maid - or whatever she was - us riding on the water, and that's a....."  Again Pipsqueak and Frodo howled with laughter, and Morrie ledthe way down the side of the bridge to where the ferry was tethered.
   "Well," said Morrie, as the laughter subsided, "we'd best be going ourselves.  I'm looking forward to a meal and a pint of ale."  Across the river the hobbits could see the cheerful glow of neon lights blinking in the windows of Brandy Hall.   Long ago, Gorhendad Oldbuck (Morrie's great-great-great-grandfather, his great-great-uncle, or his third cousin once removed, depending on which branch of the family tree you trace) was the town drunk of Bywater.  People called him all kinds of names -- Drunkenbuck, Alebuck, and the like -- but the name that stuck was Brandybuck.  Unfortunately for him, he lived at the time of the Shire's great experiment with prohibition.  Unhappy with the dry state of affairs, he moved across the Brandywine River and set up his own little country, where the alcohol flowed freely.  Pretty soon, the greater portion of the Shire's population was packed into a small strip of land between the River and the Forest.  The mayor of Michel Delving finally admitted defeat and repealed prohibition.  Most hobbit folk returned to the four farthings, but Brandybuck and his family had set up a nice home in Bucklebeltland, so they stayed behind.  To this day, Bucklebeltland is still known for it's cavalier attitude towards the Shire's laws (making it the perfect place for Frodo to hide out from tax laws and bill collectors), and also for the fine quality of its many pubs.   As the ferry-boat moved away from the shore, Sam peered uneasily at the darkly swirling water, convinced that an armed elf-princess would jump up and bonk him on the nose.  Knowing the Bucklebeltlanders' reputation, he wasn't sure that he liked the idea of taking a boat piloted by Morrie (after all, Frodo's parents Gordo and Primadonna had died in an accident involving drinking and boating).  "Um, about that bridge," he offered, "couldn't that Black Rider fellow just ride across and attack us on the other side?"   "Samwise, my butt," grumbled Morrie to himself, "Samfool is more like it."  Aloud he answered, "It's clearly posted that you have to take boats eastbound, and since this is the last boat, we'll be safe."   Peering into the murk, Sam could just make out a dark figure walking around on the west bank.  The figure moved towards the bridge, but noticing a sign it turned dejectedly and disappeared into the night.   "Here we are," declared Morrie as the ferry pulled into its slip.  "Coming, Sam?"  Looking around, Sam realized that Pipsqueak and Frodo had already scrambled ashore.  "C'mon, Sam, Crickhollow is just around the corner and Fatty's getting dinner on."   Entering Crickhollow, Frodo could tell that his friends had taken great pains to set it up just like his old home at Bag End.  All of his posters were already up on the walls, his fish were swimming happily in an aquarium set up in the corner, and they had even left a pile of his dirty laundry beside the T.V.  He felt ashamed that they'd gone to all of this work and he was going to have to leave them.   "Dinner smells great," said Pipsqueak to Fatty, who was just coming out of the kitchen, "but after sleeping under a tree last night I need to wash up first.  It's bath time."   "Which order shall we go in," said Frodo.  "Smartest first, or cutest first?  You'll be last either way, Master Pipsqueak."   "No fear!" said Merry, "There are two tubs back there.  You're left with the shower, though, Sam.  In a class-based society such as this you really can't expect a servant-boy like you to enjoy the same luxuries as your betters."   As the three travelers filed back to the washroom, Sam was muttering something about ". . . first one up against the wall when the revolution comes."  Soon, though, the sound of splashing and wallowing was mixed with the sound of Pipsqueak's favorite bathing song.   Rubber Ducky, you're the one,   You make bathtime lots of fun,   Rubber Ducky, I'm awfully fond of you;   (woh woh, bee doh!)   Rubber Ducky, joy of joys,   When I squeeze you, you make noise!   Rubber Ducky, you're my very best friend, it's true!   (doo doo doo doooo, doo doo)   Rubber Ducky, you're so fine   And I'm lucky that you're mine   Rubber ducky, I'm awfully fond of -   Rubber ducky, I'd like a whole pond of -   Rubber ducky I'm awfully fond of you!There was a terrific flush, and a shout of "Whoa!" from Sam as he was scalded in the shower.  It wasn't long before all three were drawn back to the dining room by the smell of Fatty's roasted mushrooms.   Now, if you've ever met a hobbit, you know that they love to eat.  For such little guys, they can pack away a lot of food, which is why you'd betterbe sure you've a well-stocked larder before inviting a hobbit home for the weekend.  Above all, though, hobbits loved mushrooms.  Hobbit gourmands had identified seven hundred and thirty eight varieties of edible mushrooms, and from the look of his waistline, you could tell that Fatty was familiar with them all.  He'd prepared a sumptuous six course feast based completely around fungus.  He started with a nice little appetizer of mushrooms stuffed with cheese, followed by a salad of morels, stir fried shitakes, grilled portabellos, and roasted truffles.  He ended it all with mushroom ice cream, but curiously everyone decided they were full at that point, and pulled their chairs around the fireplace to talk.   "Well, I'm not sure exactly how to say this . . ." started Frodo when Pipsqueak interrupted.   "Years from now," he began, "when someone writes the story of ouradventures, no one is going to want to dwell on this scene.  They'll want tomove ahead into the action, so let's not draw this out.  Let's just pretend that you already know that we know all about the Ring . . . "   "But how?" protested Frodo.   "Do you think we're idiots?" Morrie piped in.  "You'd never have a chance with Pipsqueak's cousin Cassiopiea without magical help.  You're myfriend, man, but I've got to say that you've got a face only a mother could love.  A blind mother."   "Anyway," continued Pipsqueak, "let's just pretend that we've alreadytold you we're going with you, you've protested, and we've insisted.  Sam's nice and all, but let's face it, he's a bit of a stick in the mud.  Adventures will be a lot more fun with Morrie and I along."   "You are a set of scoundrels!" cried Frodo.  "Bless you one and all." They all danced around Frodo (not that there's anything wrong with that) and Morrie and Pipsqueak started a song they'd apparently composed for the occasion.   Farewell we call to hearth and hall!   To hobbit lasses one and all.   To Cassiopiea, Mary Jane,   To Beth, and Ruth, and sweet Lorraine.   To the wafflefoot twins with kisses sweet,   To all the gals with those sexy bare furry feet.   Someday we'll return to this corner of the world,   And maybe even Sam will meet a nice hobbit girl.   For now we're off on a quest of sorts,   To meet the women found in exotic ports.   We might find elf-maids with pointy ears,   Or even kiss dwarf girls (after eight or nine beers).   We must be gone, we must be gone.   We leave before the crack of dawn!   "Actually, guys, if it's okay with you, could we wait until about nine or so?" asked Frodo.  "I'm exhausted."   "Well, of course we'll sleep in.  'Nine' just doesn't rhyme.  'We must be gone, we must be gone, we leave before the crack of nine'?  Old Bilbo would have never let me get by with a song like that," said Morrie.  "I've got it all set up.  We'll wake up at nine, Fatty will make up a nice breakfast of mushroom omelets, Sam will pack all of our bags while we have a nice leisurely smoke, and we'll be gone by noon.  Our route takes us hiking through the Old Forest."   Fatty suddenly went pale.  "Wait a minute!  No one told me anything about the Forest!  I can't go in there, I'm afraid of trees!"   "You're afraid of trees?  What kind of pansy are you?" demanded Frodo.  "If you can't handle a few trees, you're not going to do us much good on the road.  Maybe you should stay behind and tell Gandalf where to find us."   Fatty seemed relieved that everyone agreed to this plan.  After some final preparations, they all settled down to bed.   After tossing and turning for some time, Frodo finally settled down into an uneasy sleep.  Eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees.  When he turned away from the window to face the classroom, he noticed he wasn't wearing any clothes.  Just then, the teacher started to pass out an exam that he hadn't studied for.  In a panic, he woke up.
    Frodo woke suddenly.  It was still dark in the room, and hefelt almost as if he were falling.  A moment later he hit thefloor.  Blearily he looked up to see the light of a candle flameburning in the doorway.  "What?  What is it?" said Frodo, stillshaken and bewildered.    Out of the fire there spoke a voice. "What is it!" criedMorrie.  "I have been pounding on your door for five minutes.It's nearly ten, Fatty's eaten half your breakfast and we must beleaving soon.  You'll have to make do with the scraps while I getthe ponies ready."    It was, of course, not so bad as all that.  Fatty had preparedmore than enough for a hobbit twice Frodo's size and there wasplenty left.  So Frodo had a nice breakfast with eggs and sausageswhile the others finished preparations for the journey ahead.    Soon after twelve o'clock the five hobbits were ready tostart.  Frodo was still yawning.  Morrie went in front leading anoverburdened pony, and took his way along a path that went througha small grove behind the house, and then trampled across severalfields.    In a shed they found their ponies: four sturdy beasts of thekind loved by hobbits.  They mounted, and were soon riding alongunder the midday sun.  Ahead of them loomed the Hedge.    "How are you going to get through the Hedge?" asked Fatty.    "I will show you!" said Morrie.  He turned left along theHedge, and they came to a ramp leading down.  A passage had beendug into the earth and walled with brick, forming a tunnel leadingunder the Hedge and into the Forest on the far side.    Here Fatty stopped, quailing at the sight of the trees.  "Good-bye friends!" he said.  "I wish you were not going into theForest.  I'm afraid there won't be anyone to rescue you, but goodluck to you."    "Tell Gandalf to go along the East Road; we shall soon be backon it ourselves," said Frodo.  They waved and disappeared into thetunnel.    They passed a gate on the far side and Morrie locked it behindthem.    "Well!" said Morrie.  "We have left the Shire, and are now onthe edge of the Old Forest."    "Are the stories true?" asked Pipsqueak, casting a glance backto the tunnel.    "I don't know which stories you mean," answered Morrie.  "Idon't believe those old bogey stories such as Fatty's nurses usedto tell him.  Goblins and wolves and walking trees!  No, I don'tthink so, but the Forest is queer. Sometimes you'll feel someonewatching you, but when you look about there's no one there.  Thereare queer things living deep in the Forest, and in the downs on thefar side and someone makes tracks amongst the trees.  Not far fromthis tunnel there should be a path which will take us northeastthrough the Forest.  Due east would put us onto the Downs and southwould take us to the Witherwander River which starts out on theDowns and joins the Brandywine in the south of the Forest.  Nohobbit has ever charted its full course.  We don't want to go THATway!  The Witherwander valley is the worst part of the whole wood -full of bogs and swamps, sinking sands and unfriendly creatures."    The hobbits now left the Hedge and rode up another ramp to thefloor of the Forest.  The trees were thick about them almostimmediately, trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes:  straight orbent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled andbranched or branchless, clustered or scattered, tall, short,lightning scarred, intertwined, infested, bewebbed, mossy, dark,damp, shimmering, peeling, vine covered, young or old, flowering,deciduous, coniferous, fruit bearing, creaking, cracked, hollow,budding and dying, burned, slimy, shaggy, scaley, green, grey,brown, and, well, just a very lot of different kinds of trees.    They went on for some time, the ponies carefully picking theirway through the twisted and interlacing roots.  The ground rosesteadily, and as they went forward it seemed as if the trees becametaller, darker, thicker, danker, and a great many other ominousadverbs as well.  They could catch only occasional glimpses of theSun through the thick trees overhead, and each time they did theyseemed to have veered somewhat off course and would have to turnagain to the northeast.  After an hour or two the trees closedoverhead completely, wrapping them in a twilight gloom that leftthem guessing at their direction and able to do little more thanmove steadily forward.    The afternoon was wearing away when they stumbled into a deepfold in the ground.  It was so steep and overhung that it provedimpossible to climb out of, in either direction, without leavingtheir ponies behind.  As that would require carrying their ownfood, and rather alot of it at that, it was completely out of thequestion.  All they could do was to follow the fold - downwards.The ground grew soft, and in places boggy, and soon they foundthemselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through aweedy bed.    There was not yet any sign of a path, and the others began towonder if Morrie were not completely lost.  Pipsqueak suddenlyfelt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning letout a shout.  "Oi! Ai! Ee!" he cried.  No one was quite sure why."You don't have any idea where you are going, do you!"    Morrie shot him a venomous look, a glare that would havewarned any of his business associates against further words.  "Ishould not shout if I were you," said Morrie.    Pipsqueak, however, was undeterred.  "It has not taken you longto lose us!"  Morrie's face became grim and he nudged his ponyforward with blood in his eyes.  It might have gone badly forPipsqueak then, but just as Morrie was drawing close Sam let out awhistle and pointed ahead.    "Look, isn't that an opening up ahead?" asked Sam.    A short distance ahead the gully came to an end and led quitesuddenly out of the gloom.  The stream flowed down into a darkriver of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched overwith willows, blocked with fallen willows, flecked with thousandsof faded willow leaves, and otherwise heavily bewillowed.  The lateafternoon sun shone golden through the break in the trees,illuminating a faint footpath running along the bank of the river.    "Well, I know precisely where we are," said Morrie, speakingquickly before any more comments about his navigational abilitiesmight be made.  "This is the River Witherwander!  We have strayedjust a little from our path."  Pipsqueak looked about to protest,but Morrie spoke on unheeding.  "Perhaps there is some truth tothose old stories about the trees moving of their own accord afterall.  They could have cut off our path and herded us here.  Thatmust be it."    Seeing nothing else for it, the hobbits filed out and Morrieled them down to the riverside.  There they stopped to water theponies and take a brief rest.  The long ride had worn them down andthe soft grass beneath the willow trees was a welcome change ofseating as they refilled their own water bottles.  They yawned,lightly at first, weariness seeming to creep over them now thatthey could take a break at last.    Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod.  Off to his sideMorrie and Pipsqueak had wandered over to a great knotted oldwillow and were resting against it.  Sam had stopped, pretty muchwhere his pony had, and sat blinking stupidly about himself.    Frodo felt that some cool water might help revive him andwandered towards the riverbank, half in a daze.  He did not evenknow he had reached the riverbank until he tripped over a root ofthe old willow and fell headfirst into the water with a greatsplash.  He broke back to the surface a moment later, gasping andsputtering.  "Help!  Help!", he cried, as he attemptedineffectually to reach the shore.  As the slow current carried himaway Frodo could see his friends half stirring in response to hiscries, but then settling back into weary sleep.    Choking now and fearing he would follow his parents into awatery grave Frodo thought he dimly heard a voice as he drifted outof sight and conciousness: a deep glad voice, singing carelesslyand happily:            Hey doll!  merry doll!  ring a ding dial-O!            Ring a ding!  hop along!  follow the willow!            Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadildo!    With a last gasp of effort Frodo kicked himself to the surfaceof the water and cried out once more before sinking beneath thesurface.  He felt the cold darkness settle over him, and knew nomore.    Until a moment later when he was pulled coughing and sputteringfrom the water by strong hands.  He hung helplessly, spitting upwater and a tragically large portion of his breakfast, before hecould begin to breathe normally again and get his first clear lookat his rescuer.    It was a man, or so he seemed.  At any rate he was too largeand heavy for an ordinary hobbit, if not quite tall enough for oneof the Big People.  He had a long brown beard; his eyes were blueand bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple.  He wore yellowboots, a blue coat and a battered hat with a tall crown and a longblue feather stuck in the band.  In his free hand (Frodo wasdangling precariously from the other) he carried on a large leaf ason a tray a pile of white water-lilies and a small doll.  Frodofound himself noting that the doll looked much like the manhimself, save that its hat seemed to sport a peacock feather ratherthan a kingfisher.    "Whoa! steady there!" cried the old man, and Frodo stoppedsquirming as if he had been struck stiff.  "Now, my little fellow.Where be you a-going to, breathing like a fish?  What's the matterhere then?  Do you know who I am?  I'm Tom Bombadil."    "My friends and I were lost.  I fell in the water and they allwent to sleep.  I could have drowned!" cried Frodo breathlessly.    "What?" shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air and givingFrodo quite a jolt.  "Friends napping when help is being needed?Let's go and see this."  He set Frodo down and they made their wayback up the path to where the other hobbits were sleeping.    Tom let out a great laugh and sang a bit of his nonsense rhyme,though Frodo looked fit to boil.  The three hobbits woke and satup, rubbing thier eyes at this strange apparition.    "Frodo!" cried Sam, seeing his master all wet and bedraggled."What happened?"    "What happened?" yelled Frodo with some heat.  "I nearlydrowned while you three had a nice nap."    The three jumped up, all trying to explain at once:  "We werebespelled!", "The sleep...", "I just closed my eyes for a moment!","Why'd you go fall in the water anyway..."    Looking around Sam suddenly pointed at the great grey willowunder which they had all slept.  "That... that there willow, itmust be one of those walking trees.  I'd bet it put us all to sleepI would!"  The others gaped and then nodded quickly in agreement.    Tom regarded the hobbits with great amusement and laughedagain.  "Oh, the old 'willow-man' was it?  Well, that's as may be,but Tom Bombadil must be going.  You should all come home with me.The table is laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white breadand butter.  Goldberry is waiting.  You follow me as quick as youare able."  With that he gave a beckoning wave and went hopping anddancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly andnonsensically.      Hey!  Come merry doll!  daring doll!  My darling!      Hop along little friends, up the Witherwander.      Tom's going on ahead to get the ponies fodder.      Goldberry will make the beds and set the board,      With bread and honey and sweet delights, the River daughter.      Hey now!  merry doll!  We'll be waiting for you!    They all stared after him for a long moment, but the promise offood and good beds would draw any hobbit.  And so they startedafter him, still arguing amongst themselves:    "You know, now that I think of it... that willow root thattripped me DID seem to move of its own accord."    "I think he was an entwife," opined Pipsqueak.    "A what?"    "An entwife.  Old Bilbo told me a story about them... no, notone of THOSE stories."    Up ahead the trees parted and a house lay beneath the darkshapes of the Barrow-downs.  Golden light spilled out over thethreshold and they hurried forward.
     The four hobbits stepped over the threshold and stoodstill, gaping. In a chair sat a woman; she wore nothing morethan a bathrobe, her long yellow hair tangled in an unrulymess. It was obvious from her tired look that this lady hadlistened to more silly songs than was bearable. It was alsoobvious that Tom had good taste where women were concerned. The opposite wasn't certain at all.      When she saw them she shrieked. "Ahh! You didn't tellme you were bringing friends!" then promptly turned on heralluring smile. "Come in! Laugh and be merry!" she said.      Morrie gave her a humorless look. "Madam, I'm aBrandybuck. We don't do 'merry'."      Generally speaking, those with a problem distinguishingthe two pronunciations quickly found themselves facing much moreimportant problems indeed.      Frodo spoke. "Fair lady Goldberry! Now I know whatBombadil was talking about when he said that you'll makethe boards and make the beds." Then he stopped as herealised that may have not sounded as well as heintended.      Her smile faded. "Oh, he said that, didn't he? I knewI should have never left my mother. I admit her place wasrather watery, but this man..."      "Fair lady!" said Frodo quickly, knowing that in adomestic dispute the guests were also bound to suffer. "Tellme, if it hasn't been discussed over and over again, whois Tom Bombadil? Is he a Maia that went native? Is heperhaps an authorial self-insertion? Is he Eru, GodAlmighty?"      Goldberry snorted.      "Mainly, he's a very bad singer."      Before long they were all seated at the table, twohobbits on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry andTom (whose insistence at being called Master threatened tobring about a new domestic quarrel). The hobbits ate asonly famished hobbits can, and before the dinner's end,Pipsqueak had to wrestle with Sam over the remnants ofa cake. The guests became suddenly aware that they wereall shouting at the top of their lungs.      At last the table was cleared. Goldberry came andwished them a good night.      "Have peace now," she said, "until the morning! Andheed no nightly noises - especially if they are comingfrom our bedroom."      Tom sat on a while beside them in silence and atlast Frodo spoke:      "Did you hear me calling, To - eh.. Master, or wasit just chance that brought you at that moment?"      "Nay, I didn't hear. I was too busy singing. And I wastoo busy admiring this really beautiful doll of myself, sinceI'm really as self-centered and self-absorbed as can be."      With a glance at his friends, Frodo asked, "Tell us aboutthe willow-man. What is he? And how can it be I neverheard of him before?"      "No, don't!" said Morrie and Pipsqueak togetherthen looked embarassed. "I mean it will give poor Frodonightmares for sure," went on Morrie.      Tom laughed, and after a couple of accusatory looksamong the hobbits, they all went to bed.      Frodo dreamt that night of a pinnacle of stone ontop of which the figure of a man stood. Suddenly a shadowlike the shape of wings passed across the moon at whichthe man shouted "YOU ARE NOT A BALROG!"      Pipsqueak lay dreaming pleasantly, but suddenly hewoke - he still heard in the darkness the sound that haddisturbed his dream 'tip-tap, squeak'. Thinking someonewas calling his name, he stood up groggily. The noiseseemed to come from Bombadil and Goldberry's room.Tip-toeing he approached the half-open door and triedto take a peep inside: Goldberry was hitting Tom overthe head with his own miniature while Tom said thingslike "But, dearest--". Pipsqueak gave a grunt of disgustand went back to bed.      Goldberry looked up at the grunt. "Was he peepin'?"      Tom, glad at the small reprieve, rubbed his bruisedhead. "No, I think he was Pipsqueak."      It was the sound of Shirrifs coming that Morrie thoughthe heard while asleep. But then he seemed to hear or rememberhearing: "Nothing passes doors or windows without a properwarrant." He breathed deep and fell asleep again.      As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the nightin deep content, if logs that chased and then happily savagedtheir imperialistic masters are contented.      Next day Tom told them many remarkable stories,sometimes as if speaking the himself, sometimes lookingat them suddenly with a bright blue eye (the other eyehad been mysteriously blackened during the previousnight). Often his voice would turn to song, and thehobbits would simply shut their ears and pray it wouldpass.      After a couple of truly dull horror stories about the OldForest, suddenly Tom's talk left the wood and using aconvoluted course seemed to rest on the Downs. Tomtold them of the Barrow-wights who walked in the hollowplaces always happily ready to provide a side adventurefor tired travelers.      The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumourof the Barrow-wights and their liking for plotwise-insignificantside-adventures had been heard. The did not make a talethat any hobbit liked to listen to, since they mainly preferredfocused narratives. They (inevitably) lost the thread of histale.      When they caught his words again they found that hehad now wandered into strange places beyond theirmemory, waking thought or even their hallucinations,into times when the world was carried on the back of aturtle and the seas flowed straight down in an endlesswaterfall; and still Tom went singing out into such timesas only ancient myths described, when people left thedoors unlocked at night, and even further back, whenthose damn kids knew some proper respect for theirparents. Then suddenly he stopped, and they saw thathe nodded as if he had bored even himself to sleep.      "Who are you, Master?" Frodo asked, sudden fearin his voice.      "Gnnngshm..?" Tom seemed to mumble and hefinally fell asleep with a good thump.      After supper Goldberry once again hurried awayfrom the table, because Tom now seemed wide awakeagain and plied them with questions.      He appeared already to know more about them andall their families, which caused extreme embarrassmentto all of them, and not a little worry from Morrie. Tommade no secret that he owed his secret knowledge toFarmer Maggot whom he seemed to regard as a personof more importance than they had imagined: "He has abig bank account, and quite a few connections; and fromthe Entwives' aging wood, he made worthy logs." It wasalso clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves of Gildorwhich caused exclamations of sudden understanding fromall of the hobbits. "Before I saw him, I thought that the Elveswere High." said Sam and Frodo agreed.      Indeed so much did Tom know, that Frodo foundhimself describing in greater detail his escapades withCassiopeia Took than was generally considered polite.While Pipsqueak was hurriedly trying to take notes on hisnapkin, Tom's eyes glinted.      "Show me the precious Ring!" he said suddenly in themidst of the story; and to Frodo's astonishment Tomsimply reached his hand and painfully yanked the chainfrom Frodo's neck.      He juggled it from one hand to the other, while Frodotried ineffectually to stop him. In the end Tom spun theRing in the air and it vanished with a flash. Then Tomleaned forward and reached his hand behind Frodo'sear. "Here it is -- hey, where did it go?"      In the end the hobbits had to go and search the housefor it. They only found it five hours later, inside the hollowminiature of Tom's self. "Those magic rings - you can'ttrust the little rascals." Tom said with a laugh, and notwithout a hint of disappointment for the success of thesearch.      Tom gave them a lot of suggestions about how theyshould travel the next day: "Keep on the right of the road - and mind the traffic. Don't you speak with Barrow-wights or take rides with strangers." Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck meet a side-adventure.        Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadildo!        By water, wood and hill, by an armadillo        by fire, sun and moon, by the heat and frost        Come, Tom Bombadil, or we'll now be toast.When they had sung this, he clapped them each on theshoulder and taking candles led them back to their beds.
  That night they heard no noises.  But either in his dreams or out ofthem, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running inhis mind:  a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a greyrain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass andsilver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country openedbefore him under a swift sunrise.  The vision melted, and Frodo awoke feeling a rather depressing senseof predestination.  Everything is fixed, and you can't change it,echoed the ethereal chorus in his memory.  "You're a fool, Frodo Baggins," muttered Frodo, shaking his head andlooking about for some sign of breakfast.  Instead, Sam was immediatelyat his side, stroking Frodo's hand, kissing Frodo's hand, and suckingFrodo's fingers, as was his wont.  "Good boy, Sam," praised Frodo,tossing Sam a scooby-snack.  "How about some breakfast, then?"  After breakfast, the four Hobbits made ready to say farewell to theirhost.  Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, shimmying and shaggingrestlessly.  Tom came out of the house and waved his doll and dancedupon the doorstep, bidding the Hobbits to go speedily and reminding themto beware of the dread Barrow-wights that haunted the Downs at night."They're always after my lucky charms!" he explained.  Duly warned, the Hobbits thanked Tom for his advice and trotted theirpanting ponies away, in haste to be out of hearing range before Tomstarted singing again.  They rode off along a path that wound away frombehind the house, and went slanting up and over a high, green hill.They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the steep slope, whensuddenly Frodo stopped.  "Goldberry!" he cried.  "My fair lady, clad all in terrycloth!  Wehave never said farewell to her, nor seen her since that evening!"  Hewas so distressed that he turned back.  Morrie rolled his eyes.  "No wonder he's still a virgin," he muttered.  "What?" exclaimed Pipsqueak, looking sharply at Morrie.  "Am not," shot back Frodo.  "Are too," Morrie snidely insisted.  "Now see here--" began Sam, but Pipsqueak cut him off.  "Whatever do you mean, Morrie?  What about Cassiopiea,and...well...and...well, what about Cassiopiea?"  "For the love of Elbereth!" implored Frodo.  "Please, you two, justdrop it!"  "Yes, I hear you're quite adept at dropping it, cousin," sneeredMorrie.  He raised an eyebrow and glanced significantly at Pipsqueak.  Pipsqueak gasped.  "You mean--?"  He glanced at Frodo, who at themoment could easily have been mistaken for a poppy in Farmer Maggot'sfields, and grinned back at Morrie.  "Go on!" he said, laughing.  "It's true," said Morrie.  "'Limp as last night's noodles left out inthe rain,' is how your cousin Cassie put it."  "Well, then, whyever did she keep--ohhh, the power of the Ring, Isuppose."  "Yes, poor Cassie.  Apparently the Ring only bestows the power toseduce; the power to perform is up to the wearer."  "Enough!" cried Frodo, his face contorted in anguish.  "All right!  Iadmit it!  I can't--perform with a lass.  I don't know why; it's notthat I haven't tried.  Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to bethe only fifty-year-old virgin in all of Hobbiton?"  "The Shire."  "What!" snapped Frodo defensively.  "The Shire," Morrie drolly repeated, smirking.  "As far as I know,you're the only fifty-year-old virgin in the whole of the Shire."  "Including Bucklebeltland," suggested Pipsqueak helpfully.  "For that matter, Frodo, you're probably the only virgin over thirtyin all the Shire--"  "Including Buckle--"  "I take your point!"  Frodo stalked off up and over the hill.  "Now see what you've done," reproved Sam, jabbing a finger intoPipsqueak's chest.  "Sam, please," sniffed Morrie, swatting Sam's hand away fromPipsqueak.  "It's not proper to treat your betters in so familiar afashion."  "Never you mind 'proper,' Mr. Moribund, sir.  You and Mr. Paragraphhere made poor Mr. Frodo feel bad, and I'll not be standing for it, andthat's a fact!"  Morrie and Pipsqueak burst into laughter.  "Well, then," leeredMorrie, as Sam scowled and stamped his foot in protest, "why don't yougo find poor Mr. Frodo and make him feel gooood,Sammy-Sammy-Sam-Saaammmm?"  "Maybe I'll do just that," retorted Sam, who wouldn't recognizesubtext if it smacked him upside the head.  As if to further prove thepoint, he shouted, "Coming, Mr. Frodo!  Coming!" while Morrie andPipsqueak fell to the grass, rolling and laughing hysterically.  Damn the lot of them.  Frodo grinned to himself.  It sounded so fine, he said it aloud:"Damn the lot of them!"  (To say that Frodo was socially retardedwould be somewhat of an understatement.)  Damn them all.  He ought to cast them all to the dread Barrow-wightsand invite the beasts to have at their lucky charms.  Frodo imagined hisso-called friends lying dead and dismembered, while he himself escaped,alive and free.  Gandalf would admit there had been nothing else hecould do.  Just then a familiar, low voice interrupted his sadistic reverie:"Mr. Frodo, sir?"  Not Sam, amended Frodo.  Morrie and Pipsqueak, without a regret, butnot Sam.  "Yes, Sam," he said, turning and smiling fondly; for suddenlyit struck him that he was, indeed, very fond of the young Hobbit.  Sam blushed and lowered his gaze.  "Aw, Mr. Frodo, I was thinking,maybe, you could use a bit of cheering up."  He took Frodo's hand intohis own, held it up to his cheek.  "You always do like it when I holdyour hand," he said shyly.  "I do, indeed," said Frodo, caressing Sam's cheek with his fingertips."However did you get in the habit of doing it, anyway?"  "Oh, I don't know, sir."  Sam shrugged, and slipped his mouth over thenearest fingertip.  "Maybe it's just you have such beautiful hands."  A shadow fell over Frodo's face.  "Morrie said I'm ugly," he said,looking away. "You never were," protested Sam.  "Why, you're the fairest Hobbit inall the Shire, as beautiful as any Elf."  "Really?" Frodo glanced back doubtfully at Sam.  "Really and truly, sir.  Mr. Morrie's just jealous, on account that helooks like the wrong end of a pony with a bad case of the Bywaterblasts."  Frodo burst out laughing.  "You always could make me laugh, dear Sam,"he said, leaning against Sam.  "Aw."  Again the color rose in Sam's face.  "He just knows he can'thold a candle to you, and that's--"  He stopped short, suddenlyself-conscious.  "A fact?"  Frodo's eyes shone brightly at Sam.  Sam glanced up at him,and nodded.  "Fact is, sir, I always wondered how it was so handsome aHobbit never did wed--oh, I'm sorry, sir!" cried Sam, aghast.  Frodo winced, but patted Sam's hand reassuringly, bestowing a lightkiss upon it for good measure.  "It's all right, Sam," he said.  "I seemto be cursed, doomed by forces beyond my control never to know the blissof conjugal relations."  Sighing wistfully, Frodo lifted his eyes to thehills; whence would come his help?  "Well, come along, Sam."  Frodo looked back to Sam, and gave him ashadowed smile.  "I suppose we'd better find Morrie and Pipsqueak and beheading out of here before it gets dark.  They may be asses, but theyare my cousins, all the same."  "And they may prove useful yet, sir," added Sam, walking hand in handwith Frodo back over the hill to where they had left Morrie andPipsqueak.  Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and thescent of turf, lying a little too long after lunch to linger overbottles of elderberry wine, sucked drop by drop from slender fingers:these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened.  Howeverthat may be, the Hobbits woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleepthey never meant to take.  Extricating their entwined limbs, they sprangto their feet in alarm:  The setting sun throbbed crimson as it sankbelow the horizon.  Red sky at night, sailor's delight, hissed thewind, chilling the companions to their very bones.  In defiance of all principles of meteorology, known and unknown, athick fog rolled in from nowhere, quickly enshrouding the Hobbits andisolating them one from another.  "Sam?" called Frodo shakily.  "Sam?  Morrie?  Pipsqueak?"  He thought he heard a dim, answering call of Frodo but he could notbe sure.  "Sam?  Sam, where are you?  Morrie, Pipsqueak?  Please answerme!  Where are you?"  Blindly he stumbled through the fog and the dark,his curls plastered damply against his brow.  Hey sailorrrrr....  Frodo halted.  "Sam?" he queried in a quavering voice.  Hey, sailor, where are you going?  "Who are you?" demanded Frodo.  "And what have you done with Sam?"Falling silent, he waited, but there was no answer, only the slither ofthe wind beneath the fog.  "Sam!  Where are you?" Frodo cried out miserably.  There was no reply.  He was suddenly aware that it was getting verycold, and the wind was growing stronger, dispersing the mists asimprobably quickly as they had descended.  A glance showed him that hewas now standing on a high hilltop, which he must have climbed in hisfrantic chase, which would explain why his clothes and hair were soakedwith perspiration.  Out of the east a biting wind was blowing.  To hisright there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape.  Agreat barrow stood there.  "Where are you?" he cried again, both angry and afraid.  "Here!" said a voice deep and mellow and strangely seductive.  "I amwaiting for you!"  "No!" said Frodo; but he did not run away.  Trembling, he looked up tosee a tall, dark, and handsome figure silhouetted against the stars.  Itleaned over him, and Frodo felt his knees grow weak.  He thought he sawan appraising glimmer in the two pale eyes gazing intently down into hisown, and he stood transfixed, silently yearning for he knew not what.Then strong, manly hands seized him, and a body hard as iron boreagainst him, pressing him insistently to the ground, and he rememberedno more.  He awoke feeling curiously sticky, and, even more curiously, strangelysatiated.  He had no desire to move, but was content to lie as he foundhimself:  naked, on the ground, his clothes scattered around him, acrushed cigarette butt smoldering in a bare patch of dirt.  LanguidlyFrodo reached over and twisted the cigarette butt into the ground,snuffing it.  Hmm.  He'd never been one for smoking, but now he felt a sudden andpowerful craving for a good pipe full of weed.  Damn.  Frodo supposedthat he would have to bestir himself to find where his companions hadgot to; Sam alone could be counted on to pack half a year's crop of leafwhenever he undertook so much as a trip to the post office.  Hopefully,thought Frodo, he hadn't smoked it all by now.  Groaning, he stretched and sat up and set about reclothing himself,pausing to wipe off the curiously sticky night dew which had condensedupon certain regions of his skin.  He looked about in vain for his pony.Double-damn.  "Sam!  Morrie!  Pipsqueak!" called Frodo.  "Where are you?  Sam!Morrie!  Pipsqueak!  Hullo!  Rise and shine!  Here comes the sun, and Isay, it's all right!"  From the barrow emerged Sam, Morrie, and Pipsqueak, blinking, bemused,and naked as the day they were born.  "Mr. Frodo?" murmured Sam, gazingblearily in Frodo's direction.  "Mr. Frodo, I had the queerest dream."  "Hm.  So did I," said Frodo, straining to hold back a wide grin.  "Isay, Sam, you wouldn't happen to have any pipeweed about you, wouldyou?"  "Pipeweed?" repeated Sam.  "You, sir?  I mean, begging your pardon,sir, but no, it's in my pack, on the pony--"  Sam snapped to, lookedabout, as if only then becoming cognizant of their situation.  "Nowwhere in tarnation are those ponies, anyway?  And why am I standing herein my birthday suit--why, and Mr. Pipsqueak--and Mr. Morrie, too!"  "Don't fret, Sam; it suits you well," laughed Frodo.  Then Frodosuddenly blushed, and wondered why.  "Well, it doesn't suit me at all!" cried Pipsqueak indignantly.  "Wemust find our ponies, and our packs.  Either that or you must lend ussome of your clothing, Frodo."  "I haven't any to lend, except what I'm wearing," said Frodo.  "I amafraid my pony has likewise wandered, and with it my pack."  "Oh, this is terrible!" wailed Pipsqueak.  "We can't go walking toBree stark naked!"  "Hm," said Morrie, pointedly regarding Pipsqueak's nether regions."Those of us with a little more to show off have no reason to beembarrassed."  "Even I am not lacking in that respect," Frodo observed.  "Thank you very much, noble cousin."  Pipsqueak crossed his arms andsulked.  "Payback's a bitch," grunted Sam, thrusting his hips forward so tobetter show off his considerable assets.  "Now, Sam," chided Frodo teasingly, "there's no need to flaunt it.Anyway, none of this is helping us to find the ponies; I suppose we'llhave to call on Tom Bombadil again."  "Oh, no," groaned Pipsqueak.  "Here."  Frodo reached into his pocket and produced a handkerchief."Cover up," he said, handing it to Pipsqueak.  Pipsqueak glowered at him, but he took the handkerchief, all the same."Thank you," he sullenly muttered.  Meanwhile, Frodo cupped his handsabout his mouth and called out:       Ho!  Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!       The ground makes a cold bed, and stones a hard pillow!       Our ponies have wandered!  Bring your help near       So we can high-tail it out of here!  And, sure as deus ex machina is a fantasy writer's best friend, camethe answering call:       Old Tom Bombadil is a merry old fellow!       There's simply no end to the things he does know!       Come, ponies, and fly to your bareback riders!       Bring backpacks with breeches to cover backsiders!  Morrie and Pipsqueak exchanged erudite expressions of aesthetic angst,but Sam was simply delighted.  "Sheer poetry," he sighed, beamingblissfully.  Laughing and singing, Tom Bombadil greeted the Hobbits."Run naked in the grass, my merry friends, and let the light of day warmheart and limb!  Run naked, run naked, I say!  Cast away that thin rag,"he whipped the handkerchief from Pipsqueak's clutching hands, "and runnaked, I say!"  A rather curious thing to exhort of grown men, one would think, yetFrodo and Sam and Morrie and Pipsqueak followed Bombadil's directivewithout question.  Frodo again cast his clothing aside, running aboutnude with his friends under the morning sun because, we are given tounderstand, it is the natural thing for Hobbits to be so carefree andinnocent and unashamed, even though heretofore we have been led tobelieve that Shire Hobbits were quintessential starched-and-buttonedVictorian Brits who were as likely as Queen Victoria herself to be foundcavorting naked in the grass.  "And here are your ponies!" said Bombadil, as the ponies trotted gailyover the crest of the hill behind him, each running to its respectiverider.  The Hobbits opened their packs and clothed themselves, whileBombadil gave them directions to the road that would lead them to Bree."And in Bree you will find an old brothel called The Prancing Pony;Barliman Butterball is its worthy keeper, and his buxom wife Bella thefetching mistress of the house.  There you will find food and drink, anda warm fire, and a warm wench or two to keep you the night; and themorning will speed you on your way.  Be bold, but wary!  Keep gay yourhearts, and ride to meet your fortune!"  Then he turned and tossed uphis doll and caught it again, leaping and skipping and dancing away backover the hill whence he had come.  "Well, Mr. Frodo," remarked Sam, "I am sorry to take leave of MasterBombadil, but I won't deny I'll be glad to see this brothel he spoke of.I wonder if it'll be like the Green Dragon back home?  D'you supposethey have Hobbit wenches, or only wenches of the Big Folk?"  "There are Hobbits in Bree," said Morrie, "as well as Big Folk.  Takeyour pick!  I myself have partaken of both varieties, with perfectsatisfaction."  "Well, now, Mr. Frodo," Sam heartily exclaimed.  "This Prancing Ponymight just be the place to turn your luck for the better!  I daresayyou'll no longer be a virgin on the morrow."  "Be that as it may," Frodo sharply hissed, "please, please watchyour tongues, and remember not to mention that I have never known awoman in conjugal embrace!"  "Oh, no, of course not, Mr. Frodo.  Right, Mr. Morrie?  Mr.Pipsqueak?"  "Oh, certainly.  Of course."  They snickered, and began to sing ribaldsongs as they rode toward the soft, sultry red lights of Bree.
    Bree was the chief village of Bree-land, a small country a few milesbroad whose chief claim to fame was its aluminum siding industry.  TheMen of Bree were cheerful and independant: they belonged to nobody butthemselves.  In the lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers.The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and being unlettered hicks for themost part knew nothing of their origins.  They were believed to havestrange powers of sight and hearing, and so the Bree-folk thought thatthey were the ones who secretly ran the local psychic telephone hotline.When they appeared, they brought strange news from afar, but since theydidn't buy siding, the Bree-folk did not make friends of them.    There were also many families of Hobbits in Bree-land.  The Big 'Unsand the Little 'Uns (as they called one another) were on friendly terms,both regarding each other as necessary parts of the Bree-folk.  Nowhereelse was this peculiar (but politically correct) arrangement to befound.    The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not travel much.  Occasionally,the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Beltbuckleland or Eastfarting, thoughthe Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited.  An occasionalBeltbucklelander or adventurous Took would come out to buy some siding,but that was becoming less usual.    The village of Bree had some hundred houses of the Big 'Uns, all withaluminum siding, awnings and doors.  It was dark when Frodo and hiscompanions came to the West-gate and found it shut.  The gatekeeperjumped up and looked at them in surprise.    "Who the hell are you?" he asked gruffly.    "We are making for the inn," answered Frodo.  "We are journeying tothe east."    "Hobbits!  And from the Shire by their talk," the gatekeeper said tohimself.  He stared at them darkly, and then opened the gate.    "You'll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east ofBree!  What may your names be, might I ask?"    "Our names and our business are our own," said Frodo, not liking thenosiness of the man.    "No doubt," said the man, "But I'm supposed to ask questions afternightfall."    "We are Hobbits from Beltbuckleland, and we feel like staying at theinn here,"  said Morrie.  "I am Mr. Brandybuck.  And why don't you mindyour own damn business?"    "All right, all right!" said the man.  "I meant no offense, butthere's queer folk about, not that there's anything wrong with that."    Frodo wondered why the man was so suspicious, and wondered if anyonehad been asking about a party of Hobbits.  Could it be Gandalf, orperhaps his creditors? As soon as the gatekeeper's back was turned, adark figure climbed over the gate and into the shadows of the village.        The Hobbits rode on up a slope and drew together outside the inn.  Samstared up at the inn with its aluminum siding and felt his heart sank.He had imagined meeting terrifying creatures, but at the moment he wasfinding his first sight of Men and their aluminum houses to be quiteenough.  He pictured fierce, warlike elf-maidens peering out the out ofdark upper windows.    "We surely aren't going to stay here, are we?" he exclaimed.  "Maybewe could stay with some Hobbits.  It would be more homelike."    "What's wrong with it?" asked Frodo.  "Tom Bombadil recommended it.I expect it's homelike enough."     Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant home to familiareyes.  A sign above the door pictured a fat white pony rearing on itshind legs.  Over the door was painted the letters:  THE PRANCING PONY byBARLIMAN BUTTERBALL.  They climbed up the steps.  Frodo went forward andnearly bumped into a short, grossly overweight man with a bald head andsweaty red face.    "Can we --" began Frodo.    "Half a minute, if you please!"  shouted the man.  He dissapearedinto the tavern, and reemerged a moment later, wiping his hands on hisgreasy apron."    "Good evening, little master," he said, bending down.  Morrie andPipsqueak giggled and chortled at "little master", but Frodo glared atthem and they shut up.    "We'd like beds for four, and stabling for five ponies," Frodo said."Are you Mr. Butterball?"    "That's right," he said.  "Barliman Butterball at your service.You're from the Shire, eh?  Now what does that remind me of?  Might Iask your names, sir?"    "Mr. Took, and Mr. Brandybuck," said Frodo.  "This is Sam Gamgee,and I am Mr. Underhill."    "There now," said Butterball, "it's gone again!  Well, it'll comeback as soon as I have a chance to think."    Butterball showed them to their rooms and prepared them a dinner ina private parlor, which was served to them by his wife, Bella.  As hewas leaving, he invited them to join the company in the common room whenthey were finished.    They felt refreshed and encouraged after thier meal, and Frodo, Samand Pipsqueak decided to join the company.  Morrie, having learned longago the value of keeping a low profile, decided to stay behind, andperhaps go out later for soem fresh air.    The company was in the large common room of the inn.  It was large andmixed as Frodo discovered as his eyes adjusted to the light.  BarlimanButterball was talking to a group of dwarves near the fire.  On thebenches were various folk: the local drunks for the most part, but alsomore dwarves and other figures in the shadowy corners.    The local folk, having drunk a few pints already, cheered theShire-hobbits as they entered the room, but the strangers, especiallythe ones from the South, stared at them curiously.  Butterballintroduced them to the crowd.  The Men of Bree seemed to have strange,meaty names like Oscar-meyer, Hatfield, Weaver, Tyson, and Sandyman (notto mention Butterball).  However, the Hobbits had much more naturalnames, like Banks, Bigholes, Earthmovers, and Digger, many of which wereused in the Shire.  There even some Underhills, who immediately took toFrodo as a long-lost cousin.    Frodo said that he was interested in history and geography, but gotmany blank stares, as the Bree-folk were uneducated and such wordsweren't in their vocabulary.  The Hobbits went over to Pipsqueak andasked him all sorts of questions about the Shire, leaving Frodo to sitin the corner by himself.    The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking  of distant events.  Therewas trouble away in the South, and the Men who had come up the Greenwaywere on the move looking for lands were they could find peace.  TheBree-folk were sympathetic, but since poor refugees seldom have moneyfor siding and other home improvements, they didn't want them around.One traveller, a squint-eyed ill-favored fellow was foretelling thatmore people would be coming north in the near future.  He went on and onabout squatters' rights, and local folk were not pleased.    The hobbits were not as concerned, since Big 'Uns could hardly begfor lodgings in hobbit-holes.  They were more interested in Pipsqueakand Sam's tales of the Shire.  Pipsqueak roused a great deal of laughterwith an account of the collapse of the Town Holes in Michel Delving:Will Whitfoot, the mayor and fattest hobbit in the Shire, had beenburied in his hidden stash of cocaine, and came out looking like afloured dumpling.    Then Frodo noticed that a strange-looking flabby man sitting in theshadows was also listening intently to the Shire talk.    "Who is that?" Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr.Butterball.  "I don't think you introduced him."    "Him?" said the landlord.  "I don't really know.  He is one of thewandering folk -- Rangers we call them.  What his right name is I'venever heard, but he's known around here as Strider."    Frodo found that Strider was looking at him, and he beckoned forFrodo to come closer.    "I am called Strider," he said in a low voice.  I am pleased tomeet you,  Master Underhill.  If I were you, I would stop your youngfriends from talking too much."    Frodo noticed that Strider's attention was focused on Pipsqueak.  Tohis alarm, Frodo noticed that the ridiculous young Took was now talkingabout Bilbo's farewell.  He was giving a good imitation of the speech,and was now drawing close to the astonishing Appearance.    Frodo was annoyed.  It would bring the name of Baggins the minds ofthe locals, especially if there had been inquiries in Bree about thename.    Frodo fidgeted, unsure what to do.  Pipsqueak, unmindful of thedanger, finished the speech, then he jumped up on a table, tore off hisshirt, and started to gyrate his hips wildly.    "You'd better do something quick!" whispered Strider.    Frodo jumped up onto another table.  Some of the hobbits looked athim and laughed, thinking he had taken as much ale as was good for him.    He felt nervous, and began to fondle the things in his pockets as hedid when making a speech.  He felt the Ring on its chain, and quitesuddenly he felt a desire to slip it on and prove his manhood withBella.  It seemed to him, somehow, that the suggestion came to him fromsomeone or something in the room.   He resisted the temptation firmly.He spoke a few words, then hesitated and coughed.    Everyone was now looking at him.  "A song!" shouted one of thehobbits.  "A song, a song!" shouted all the others.  For a moment hehesitated, and then one of Bilbo's silly old songs came to mind:      Hey diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle,      The cow jumped over the moon.       The little dog cried to see such sport,      And the dish ran away with the spoon.Though since Westron had a lot more words than Modern English, the songwas quite a bit longer than that.    The applause was long and loud, and they called for an encore.   NowFrodo began to feel pleased with himself.  He danced on the table, andwhen he came to "the cow jumped over the moon" he leaped into the air.He slipped on a tray of mugs when he came down, and rolled off thetable.  The audience laughed when they saw his pants around his anklesexposing his flannel boxers with pink oliphaunts.    One swarthy Bree-lander looked at him with a mocking and knowingexpression, then slipped out the door with the squint-eyed southernerand the gatekeeper; they had been whispering together a great deal thatevening.    Frodo felt foolish.  Not knowing what to do, he pulled his pantsback up and took off the Ring.  How it came to be on his finger he couldnot tell.  He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.    "Well?"  said Strider.  "Why did you do that?  Worse than anythingyour friends could have said!  You have put your foot in it!  Or shouldI say your finger?  We better wait until the laughter dies down.  Then,if you please, Mr. _Baggins_, I should like a quiet word with you."    "Very well,"  said Frodo, "I'll talk to you later."      After the crowd left, Butterball came over to Frodo.  "I'm sorry if Icaused any trouble," Frodo said.  "It was quite unintentional.  We'll beleaving early tommorrow.  Could you have our ponies ready by eighto'clock?"    "Very good.  But before you go, I would like a word with you inprivate, Master Underhill.  Something has just come back to my mind thatI ought to tell you.  After I've seen to a thing or two, I'll come toyour room, if you're willing."    "Certainly," said Frodo, but his heart sank, wondering how manyprivate talks he has going to have before bed.  Were they against him?He even suspected fat Butterball's face of concealing dark designs.
     Frodo hurried the others ahead of him, anxious to get to thesafety of the parlour. Morrie had not yet arrived, but Frodolocked and barred the door anyway, worried about any creditorsthat might be seeking him. It was not until he had puffed up theembers of the fire that he discovered that Strider had somehowslipped ahead of them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair!     "You cannot escape me so easily," he said with a slow smile. "Youpromised to have a quiet talk with me, after all."     "What have you to say?" Frodo asked, alarmed.     "Several things," answered Strider. "But, of course, I have myprice." He looked at Frodo expectantly.     Several moments passed in silence.     "Well?" Strider said at last. "Will you not make me an offer?"     Frodo thought uncomfortably of his lost accounts. "I cannot," hesaid with reluctance. "All that I have now would hardly satisfy arogue, and I cannot spare any of it."     "Don't be ridiculous," Strider said. "You're a Baggins, no matterhow you try to pass yourself off as an Underhill. Everyone knowsthat you have plenty of money."     "Oh, indeed!" cried Frodo. "Well, that is no longer true. I amafraid that I have nothing to my name, save some small sparechange."     Strider laughed. "You are, of course, in jest."     "I am not."     Several more moments passed. Strider looked at the hobbits withnarrowed eyes.     "Are you serious?"     Frodo squirmed a little; but Pipsqueak answered readily. "Yes, heis!" he exclaimed. "Frodo has lost almost everything he owns,thanks to Gandalf."     Strider stared at them for a moment longer, then turned away indisgust. "This is NOT fair!" he shouted, glaring at the ceiling.     "Sorry," said a disembodied voice. "Take it up with the Heroes'Union."     "Don't think I won't," Strider muttered. "This is the fourthcharity case this year." He turned back to the hobbits and forceda smile on his face. "Very well, I will assist you for nothing."     "Who said we want your help?" blurted Sam. He did not the look ofthis pudgy, tall Man.     "You certainly need help from someone. That much is clear,"Strider answered. "Otherwise, you will never get out of Breealive, much less reach Rivendell. You are not my ideal choice oftravelling companions; but I see no other way to handle thematter. I hope we shall get to know one another better. When wedo, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of yoursong, Mr. Baggins. That little prank has made people notice you."     "It was sheer accident!" Frodo defended himself. "The Ringsomehow slipped onto my finger!"     "The Ring?" Strider said sharply. "You have not the Ring, Frodo.Why else did you fail to disappear?"     Frodo opened his mouth to protest, then shut it again. Striderwas right! The Ring should have made him invisible! He pulled thesmall circle of gold out of his pocket and examined it closely.It was a cheap imitation, not the real thing!     "Where is the Ring?" Strider demanded. "We cannot allow it to befound."     The hobbits looked at each other, then --     "Morrie!" they chorused.     "No wonder he slipped away!" Frodo exclaimed. "He has gone to usethe Ring himself."     "But Frodo's pants fell down," protested Pipsqueak. "Are you surethat wasn't the Ring's work?"     "Frodo is rather out of shape, is he not?" said Strider with acurl of his lip. "It is not surprising that his belt could nolonger bear to support his trousers."     "You're not in better shape yourself," Frodo retorted,embarrassed.     Strider looked down at his own ample middle and shrugged. "It isa disguise of sorts. No one expects the heir of Elendil to beoverweight."     "Who?"     "Elendil," Strider repeated. At the blank expression on thehobbits' faces, he tried again. "Isildur's eldest son? Lord ofthe Numenoreans? Come on, the kingdom of Arnor?"     Frodo shook his head. "Never heard of it," he said.     "Ridiculous! Haven't you even heard of the fabulous swords ofWesternesse?" Strider rummaged in his pack and withdrew severalsharp knives, long, shaped like the ears of an elf, and keen, ofmarvellous workmanship, damasked in red and gold. Each scabbardwas stamped in tiny black letters with the words, "MADE INFORNOST."     Frodo took one and turned it over in his hands, almost slicinghis palm open in the process. "They are beautiful blades," hesaid in wonder.     "Guaranteed to break undead wills, or your money back," saidStrider proudly. He paused in hope for a moment; but when thehobbits did not offer to pay, he sighed and leaned back in hischair.     "And Arwen wonders why I can't get any financial backing," hemuttered to himself. After a moment, he drew his hand across hisbrow. "Well, I have become accustomed to such treatment. So whatmust I do to convince you?"     "I don't know," Frodo admitted. "Why the disguise? Who are youreally? What do you know about the Ring, and how do you know it?"     Strider frowned. "Why should you believe my story, if you do nottrust me already? Still here it is --"     At that moment there was a knock on the door. The hobbits jumped at first, then realized it was only Butterball, bringing themcandles and cans of hot water. As Frodo opened the door, Striderwithdrew into a dark corner.     "I've come to bid you good night," Butterball began, his voicegrudging. Then, looking troubled, he withdrew a letter from hispocket. The parchment was crumpled and stained with jelly andhoney.     "I'm not a postman," he grumbled, "and Gandalf didn't offer memuch money to deliver this."     "Gandalf!" Frodo cried.     "Yes, Gandalf. Dratted old wizard! Still, I don't need himputting curses on his beer; I'm a busy man, with no time or moneyto spare for having hexes removed. So here, take this letter.Gandalf left it here yesterday morning for a Mr. Baggins."     "But I told you my name is Underhill," Frodo interrupted.     Butterball frowned. "Do you really think anyone was fooled?Everyone knows 'Sharkey' Baggins. And if I was you, Mr. Baggins,I'd be paying a tidy sum more for the chance of a peaceful nightwithout anyone bothering you, if you know what I mean."     Frodo did not bother to try to explain that he was currentlybroke. He snatched the letter out of Butterball's hands andhastily shoved him out the door.     "What do we do now?" Frodo asked wildly. "Butterball's threatsare clear enough, and I don't have any money to give him!"     "Start by reading the letter," Strider advised, coming out of his dark corner.     Frodo examined the letter. It was written in Gandalf's usualillegible scrawl.   Dear Frodo,   Bad news has reached me here about your secret bank account   in Isengard. I must go off at once, and cannot wait for you   any longer. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through   Bree; the landlord (Butterball) is not very trustworthy, but   he won't cheat you much. You may meet a friend of mine on the   Road: a Man, tall, a bit overweight, dark, by some called   Strider. He knows our business and will help you, if you pay   him enough. Make for Rivendell. El Rond will advise you.   Yours in haste   GANDALF.          P.S. Why didn't you give me your account number? It would have   made things much easier.      P.P.S. Don't use IT again, or you'll be leaving behind a trail   of outraged husbands that will make it too easy to track you.      P.P.P.S. Make sure it is the real Strider. There are many strange   men on the roads, and most of them are overweight. His true   name is Aragon.        While all that is gold does not glitter,          The wandering folk can get lost;        The loss of a kingdom is bitter,          Especially when out in the frost.        For an elf-maid his ardor will be woken,          For her sake he'll do anything;        He can't fight with blade that is broken,          But who knows? He just might be king!      Frodo reread the letter, stunned that Gandalf had discovered his secret bank account and that even that money would be lost."Things are going from bad to worse," he groaned.     As Frodo passed the letter to Pipsqueak, Morrie furtively slipped into the room. Strider pounced on him immediately and wrested the Ring from him.     "Take it back," he snapped at Frodo, tossing the Ring at him,"and this time, keep an eye on it!"     Frodo fumbled with the chain, then slipped the Ring back into his pocket. "Why did you do something so foolish?" he cried toMorrie. "And how did you use it?"     "I didn't do much," Morrie defended himself. "Well, I went outfor a stroll --"     "I'll just bet you did," snorted Pipsqueak, glancing up from theletter.     Morrie glared at him, then looked at Strider. "Who is this?"     "That's what I want to know," said Sam, who had fidgeted silentlybeside his master during the confrontation with Strider. "I don'ttrust him." He glared at Strider. "What say you to that?"     "That you are an idiot," answered Strider. "If I was not whoI say I am, I could have easily overpowered you already. You havejust seen how I willingly gave the Ring back to your master. Infact, if I wanted to kill you all, I could do it -- NOW!"     He stood up, and suddenly seemed to grow taller and well-muscled.In his eyes gleamed a light, keen and feral. Throwing back hiscloak, he laid his hand on the hilt of a long sword that had hungconcealed by his side. Sam stared at it, horrified.     "But I am the real Strider, fortunately," he said, lookingdown at them with a suddenly kinder eye. He smiled. "I am alreadybetrothed to an elf-maid, and I have no need for the power of theRing. I am Aragon son of Arathon; and if I can save you from yourown stupid mistakes, then I will."     There was a long silence. Pipsqueak and Morrie stared at Strider with new-found respect at this revelation of his state.     "I think we will have to trust you," Frodo said at last. "What do you think we should do?"     "Stay here, and do not go to your rooms!" said Strider."Butterball sells an excellent beer, but he will also surely sellinformation about you to the highest bidder; and the location ofthe hobbit rooms in this inn are well known. We will all remaintogether here instead."     "So much for a comfortable bed," Sam said gloomily. "I don't like this, and that's a --"     "Will you stop that!" shouted Pipsqueak. He thumped Sam solidlyon the head.     Muttering to himself, Sam slouched into the corner and preparedfor bed.     Strider remained sitting by the fire, warming his hands asthe hobbits dropped off to sleep one by one. Once he was sure theywere snoring loudly, Strider rose noiselessly from his chair:swiftly and silently he rummaged through their belongings.     "So they were telling the truth about not having any money," hemumbled disappointedly. "Elendil! It looks like I'll have to takethem with me to Rivendell for nothing, after all."     Moodily drawing a bottle from Frodo's hidden stash ofWestfarthing Chinook, Strider returned to his chair by the doorto await the coming of the Sun.
     It was a raw night back in the Shire. Howling winds and sudden gusts of rain led to an atmosphere worthy of any particularly bad detective novel. Fredegar Bolger sat quietly in the house in Crickhollow, nursing his ninth Southfarthing Malt and chewing his fingernails in dread. Then, suddenly yet predictably, he heard a noise from outside: a squick, squick coming down the path, as if from waterlogged boots. Terror seized Fredegar. A heavy knock came on the door.     "Open, in the name of Arwen!" rang out a female voice.     "No, sorry, not buying, no visitors after ten," Fredegar said instinctively. "My mom locked the door and lost the key. Lease says no visitors. Sorry."     "I'm looking for a lone Ranger," said the voice.     "Can't help you," Fredegar stammered, missing all the obvious punchlines.     "Come on!" said the voice. "Let me in. I just want to dry off. Look, I'm two thousand years old and I'm really sexy."     Fredegar's mind was too preoccupied with terror to consider this. "Go away!" he shouted. "I'm not in. Leave a message with the building manager and we'll call you back in five working days or your pizza's free."     "I'm just trying to increase the size of my part, damn you!" the woman howled out in earnest. "There's a movie coming. Open up!"     Fredegar said nothing. The mysterious woman continued hammering at the door for several minutes, cursing beautifully-rounded epithets, until finally she gave up and left. Fredegar heard the squick, squick of her boots as she headed back towards Crickhollow. Her departure, however, did not cure his terror. He continued looking around the quiet room, looking for some nameless horror he could not yet identify.     After a time he heard a commotion from the stables at Brandy Hall.                          No Witnesses!     Fredegar leanded over the wooden table, peering towards the wood-silled windows. All outside was black until a flash of lightning illuminated the countryside. He could just make out a lithe figure in camouflage riding away on a stout horse. Some of the local Hobbits were dashing out with bows and arrows. It seemed less terrifying outside, somehow. The Horn-call of Bucklebeltland, unheard for over a hundred years except on gramophone, rang out again.               G-Men! Shirriffs! A Hit! No Witnesses!     In a flash Fredegar realized the source of his terror. Wood table, wood sill, wood-planked walls, floor and ceiling. He was surrounded by wood! Like being surrounded by trees, only more cunning! So they domesticated themselves, the evil bastards! And now we rely on them! Only a matter of time till they kill us all. It all made sense, that perfect kind of sense that only comes with excessive drinking. A dawn of understanding came to Fredegar. Visions of a brick house, with a stucco ceiling and wrought-iron patio furniture, came to him as visions of peace. No longer would anyone have to fear slivers! In a flash his purpose was clear. His mind resolved, Fredegar Bolger stood and went to the closet. Inside behind the bowling balls and collections of pocket lint was the great Axe. With a grim chuckle he hefted the steel-handled Axe over his shoulder and walked towards the door. There could be no compromise. Deforestation was the only answer.     Bolger smashed open the wooden door and walked into the night.     Frodo awoke from a deep sleep. Something heavy and pointed had rammed him im the side. He looked up to see Strider standing over him, holding a finger over his lips and making a shushing noise. With quick precision Strider went to each of Frodo's three companions, kicking each in turn with his steel-tipped boots and motioning them to silence. When he reached Morrie and kicked him Morrie instinctively sensed the movement and pulled a knife, motioning to cut a throat which turned out to be Strider's ankle.     "Good instinct there," Strider whispered, examining the ankle of his boot. "That's the sort of instinct which will help you out in the Wild."     Silently they packed their few belongings, along with several of Butterball's towels and souvenir ashtrays. Strider urged them on, emphasizing the need for haste. When they were ready, however, he stopped and led them quickly to their own rooms. The hobbits gasped as they surveyed the wreckage: the beds cut and mangled, the table actually burned to ashes, piles of crockery broken and smashed. With a motion Strider reached down and picked up one of the many pieces of paper littering the floor.     "Nazdaq," he whispered solemly. "The Riders. It is as I feared! This is but one receipt of many; they have broken in during the night and run up a massive room-service tab. We must escape from Bree before they come to us with the hotel-bill. To the stables! Quickly!"     They went to the stables as quickly as they dared, being careful not to wake the greedy Butterball, or his servants, who would undoubtedly demand a gratuity. Once inside they went directly to their ponies. But disappointment held them fast again. Around each of the ponies' necks was a slender steel cable, attached to barrels of lead painted with the legend IMPOUNDED. Strider swore.     "Fie!" Strider cursed, "It is as I feared. They have taken them in lieu of a deposit. We Rangers travel light, and seldom carry bolt-cutters. I fear we must leave them behind."     "But how will we carry all our food, and these towels?" Pipsqueak whined.     "We'll have to improvise," Strider answered. He led them out through the back door of the stable and into the early dawn light. Four good ponies! he thought. They could have fetched a good price. And what have we got in exchange? Towels! One thing Arwen's not going to be glad to see me with, it's extra towels.     The tall Ranger led the puny Hobbits through Bree by many back-ways, helping them over the occasional fence, till he reached a particularly squalid house by the edge of town. Rusting appliances and tipsy sawhorses littered the yard. Motioning the others to wait, Strider snuck up to the barn and expertly picked the lock. In a flash he was inside. After a long moment he emerged leading a large donkey. "I don't think old Ferny will miss this," Strider whispered confidentially to the others. "He stole it himself from a Southerner only four days before." They placed their possessions onto the ass and led it quietly out of Bree. At the gates it seemed positively cheerful, as if happy to get out of the small rat-infested village.     "It seems to like gates," Sam said stupidly, and then named the ass Gates for no particularly clear reason.     After an hour Strider led them off onto a narrow side-trail. "It would be good for us to get off the Road," he said. "The Riders I fear, but not half so much now as the Bree law-enforcement. I fear it will go hard for any Ranger who strays into the Pony for some time."     The way was easy all that day. Whether by Strider's skills or sheer dumb luck the trail was quiet and pleasant, and the sun was out. At Pipsqueak's request Sam fished out the bottle of suntan lotion from his pack, and they passed it from hand to hand; even the tall Man took some for his neck and the bridge of his nose. When the bottle returned to Sam it was empty. "You should have brought two bottles, Sam," Frodo said gaily. "Or perhaps three! After all, the servant class should better anticipate the needs of its masters. Anyway, you'll just have to burn, and do without."     "Oh, I'm burnin', all right," Sam muttered quietly to himself.     That night they spent under the stars. As the others fell asleep Frodo condescended and offered to let Sam suck on his fingers for a time, but Sam declined. No point, Sam thought irritably. Nobody'll be likely to wake up and witness it. No witnesses, no blackmail. Where's the point in that? He rolled the other way, pulled a stolen inn-towel over himself and fell quickly asleep.     The proceeding days turned more difficult. Strider began taking them across rougher country, leading them through rocky vales and marshlands full of carnivorous insects. The ass Gates, while content and useful on easy and well-worn paths, became sluggish and uncooperative on any path that required effort. Often it would stop with a blue scream and refuse to budge forward until someone booted it. It began to fear the sight of Strider's heavy boots. "Couldn't you have stolen something more cooperative?" Frodo asked plaintively.      "I'd rather we had bought a good pony than taken this for free, even if we had to go into debt to do it," Pipsqueak laughed.     "Do not speak of such things!" Strider said quickly, and with surprising earnestness.     They journeyed on. Mosquitos the size of small ducks began to harass them. Gates continued going slower and slower, consuming their resources at an alarming rate. After a day or so Strider found a trail fenced by high hedges and trees. "Here is an ancient path of my people," he said. "It is cunningly hidden and well-protected. It will take us East towards Gambletop, where perhaps we may figure out what the hell we're doing."     "This feels like the country we were in a week or two ago," Morrie noted. "Are there Barrow-wights around here?"     "Not here," Strider answered, and Frodo felt oddly disappointed. "Though the Exiles from Atlantis once lived here. Upon Gambletop there was once a watch-tower, set as a defence against the Leech-king of old. Many generations it stood. It is said that Isildur himself once stood upon it, waiting for Gil-Gallamine, at the time of the Last Relaxing."     "Who was Gil-Gallamine?" Pipsqueak asked. After a moment a voice began quietly singing:             I dreamed I saw Gil-Gal-la-mine,             Alive as you or me.             'I thought they killed you, Gil,' I said,             Said Gil, 'I did not flee;'             Said Gil, 'I did not flee.'             'You went to Mor-dor, Gil,' I said,             'To fight mon-o-po-ly,             And kill the Rob-ber Bar-on there,             And end the Bour-geoi-sie;             And end the Bour-geoi-sie.'             'I went there, sure, and fought His greed;             I went there, sure,' said he.             'And with me went brave I-sil-dur             And wor-kers brave and free;             And wor-kers brave and free.'     The voice fell silent. Suddenly they realized the voice had been Sam's! "Don't stop there!" Pipsqueak said. "Keep going!"     "Uh, I don't think I should," Sam answered quickly. "You might not like the rest."     "I wonder what the song means by robber baron?" Frodo asked. "And workers brave and free. Honestly, the stuff they write into these old songs. They don't make any sense. Give me a nice simple tune about ale and fox-hunting any day, that's for me!"     Pipsqueak and Morrie mumbled agreement, and proceeded with Frodo down the path. Strider gave Sam a short and knowing glance before walking away, then left him and Gates to fend for themselves.     Travel was easier on the path. By morning of two days later they say Gambletop shortly ahead of them, a great rounded hill with a broken circle of old mortarwork upon its crown. Strider urged them on more quickly, wanting to get out of the long travel exposition as soon as possible.     They made it to the foot of the hill by midday, and by sunset were nearing its summit. Just short of the top they found a small dell, fenced round on three sides by rocky outcrops; there they left Sam to set up camp, gather some wood, light a fire, prepare the meals, air out their belongings, set a watch and tend to Gates while they went on to explore a bit.     At the hill-top they found the circle of broken stone. In the middle of it was the remains of a campfire, and a handful of fist-sized stones. Strider examined the remains of the fire expertly. "Someone else was camping here," he said, "and recently. I suspect it may have been Gandalf! This fire was started by burning old Racing Forms, as is often his way."     "You mean Gandalf was here in the last few days?" Frodo snapped. "And didn't even stay to wait for us? That cantankerous old bastard still has my money, too!"     "And lo!" Strider continued, lifting up one of the larger stones. A soggy note was beneath it. Pipsqueak reached for it, only to be hit by Strider with the rock. "A note on stationery stolen from the Prancing Pony," Strider continued, picking the note up himself. "It's Gandalf, I'd put money on it. If I had any."     Frodo craned in to look. "What does it say?" he asked.     Strider held the note up and squinted at it intently. "I can't make it out at all," he answered. "His scrawling was torturous in the best of times. He wrote this in a hurry, and it's all wet and smudgy. But here is the G-rune for Gandalf," he added, pointing at a particularly messy ink-smudge.     "This word near the middle of the letter could be trap," the Ranger continued slowly. "And this word just before it might be Gambletop. And I think this little bit here in the Feenamintian runes could be... uhm... nazdaq. Yes! Yes, that's it."     With a curious sinking feeling the four of them looked past the rim of the hill and out into the falling night. On the ground far away they could just make out three dark shapes some leagues distant, who seemed to be pointing straight at them and gesticulating wildly.     "I'm sure we're perfectly safe," Strider said confidently, back at the campfire. "They were a long way away. They'd never find their way up here until tomorrow afternoon at least, and by then we'll be long gone. Nope, way too hard for them to climb this hill in the dark. Yep, absolutely safe, I'm certain of it. No need to set a watch even. Absolutely, one hundred percent safe, without a doubt, no question." Reassured by Strider's optimism, the hobbits relaxed and roasted marshmallows and told ghost-stories as the night descended.     "Tell us more about old Gil-Gallamine," Pipsqueak said to Sam.     "Can't remember," Sam said curtly and evasively.     "Old Bilbo used to sing some of that stuff," Frodo said, "though he never explained it afterwards. As I remember it, Gil-Gallamine and Isildur, and his sons Elendil and Annarggion, got together a huge army to attack Mordor. And the siege lasted for nine years, and five hundred thousand Men were brutally murdered, and five hundred thousand Elves were brutally murdered, and Gil-Gallamine was brutally murdered, and Isildur was brutally murdered, and Annarggion was bru-"     "Uh, yeah, maybe we should just skip that tale for now," Strider cut in, looking quickly towards the edge of the dell. "It's time to all go to bed and dream of sugarplums and dancing cornflakes or something."     "But we want a tale of the Ancient Days!" Pipsqueak whined obnoxiously. "Do you know any tales of the Ancient Days, Strider?"     "All too many," Strider said wearily. "For I have lived in the house of El Rond, where one may hear them all endlessly and to one's great weariness. But I will tell you the tale of Trollopiel, in brief, and only if you all shut up afterward." And once they had all agreed to his terms, the tall Ranger sat up and began singing quietly:          In Dors-o-loch, in ancient time,            The luckless wand'ring Bluto lay;          His hands were smeared with blood and grime            From battles fought in wandering.          He came to Dos-o-loch that day            Though being there was held a crime;          In desperation sought his way            Though Elves said he was trespassing.          What evil luck, what evil fate            Had come upon his mortal name!          In Dors-o-loch he might abate            The headache he had simmering.          And so beneath the fence he came,            Not knowing that he'd find a mate          In Elvenhome's most lovely dame,            A lass of sexy quivering!          One night beneath the Moon he spies            Fair Lustianne upon a hill,          A sight too good for Mortal eyes,            And no clothes there a-covering.          With inhibitions running nil,            And Bluto's heart a-tantalize,          He calls out: Fair Trollopiel!            She shrieks, and runs for costuming.          Now blind and looking for that lass            He hunts for her for twenty days,          With mem'ry of that shapely ass            That set his hormones quivering.          And all that time inside she stays,            So frightened some would think her crass          For her nocturnal naughty ways            In quiet starlight shimmering.          But hormones call, as hormones will,            And out one night she goes again          To dash through Nature, wearing nil            But dew upon her, glistening.          And Bluto sees, and calls again!            Trollopiel! Trollopiel!          Though common sense tells her to run,            She stands there, naked, listening.          Then Bluto does, lust-shaking, walk            To Lustianne with gentle care,          For if by sudden move she balk,            Another month of wandering!          But Lustianne somehow will dare            To wait for him. And so they talk,          Then touch, then grope, then passion's flare            Consumes, and leaves them foundering.          Next morning naked they were found            By guards of old King Thinowilld.          (And Lustianne, by Bluto, bound!            The sergeants stood there sniggering.)          The mighty King is fury-filled.            A Man, have Lustianne ungowned!          His daughter, looking lust-fulfilled!            His rage is now a-triggering.          But Mirilou, the Queen, recalls            To him their courtship long before,          And how he chased her through the halls            And took her 'twixt the curtaining.          How nat'ral that their child adore            That lusty joy, that now appalls          The King! If now one oath he swore,            She says, a Royal Divorcing!          So Thinowilld is stuck at last,            And says to Bluto, mortal Man,          That now his anger is all past            And this new guest he's welcoming.          But also now he plots a plan            To rid him of this horny guest          who dares to take his Lustianne!            His thoughts are dark and troubling.Strider stopped for a long moment, wrapped in some inner lust. "That is but a part of a long tale," he said, "in an ancient Elvish mode which requires rhyming three syllables on every fourth line, for which rhyming dictionaries are bloody useless. It tells of the meeting of Bluto, son of Bearhand, one of the First Men to come out of the factory, and Lustianne, by far the sexiest and most kick-ass of the Elves. Her father Thinowilld gets all huffy and makes a barroom bet with Bluto that he can't steal a slipcast from the Iron Fist of Mordred. Bluto takes him up on it, and though Thinowilld locks up all of her clothes Lustianne goes with Bluto anyway. They have many adventures. I think there's a set of children's books about it. Anyway, after a long while they settled down and raised a family. Elysium the Mariner was of their kin, and El Rond and Earohed his children. El Rond you know of. Earohed was the first King of Atlantis, and from his lineage comes the great Sea-Kings, and Isildur, and the great and unfailing line of truly just and noble kings who rightfully should hold undying Godlike dominion over every little bit of Middle-earth by divine right."     The hobbits looked at Strider. There seemed to be a fiery light in his eyes and a nobility in his face and a power-mad tremble in his lip which they had never noticed, or at any rate had been able to somehow ignore, till now.     "Wow, must be about four in the morning," Morrie said, eager to change the subject. "Look: the Moon is setting. And there's three or four dark meanacing figures beginning to make their way into the dell."     Strider leaped to his feet. "Keep close to the fire!" he shouted. "Take out those cheap little swords I gave you, and stand ready! Oh, if I hadn't been reciting that damn poem I could have been on the other side of the Hill by now."     The dark shapes came closer. In them Frodo seemed to perceive a hatred of all living things, a darkness beyond darkness, a soulless Void without light, mercy or hope. Or maybe it was just dinner catching up with him. Morrie and Pipsqueak were collapsing into a blind terror, so horrified that they could barely laugh. Sam stood off to one side, his eyes wide, barely able to concentrate on the dishes. Strider alone stood bravely, holding a flaming stick in his right hand and pointing surreptitiously towards Frodo with the left. The horrific black shapes drew nearer and nearer.     And suddenly Frodo got the urge to put on the Ring. Not with any plan in mind, not to turn invisible and certainly not to seduce them, but just to put it on. The calling seemed to come from outside him. Perhaps it was a venomous, fell voice of Doom; perhaps it was the whisper of the wraiths, carried terrifyingly by the frail wind; perhaps it was just Sam whispering "Puuut the Rinnng onnnnn..." in a deceptive whisper. Frodo could not tell. Finally succumbing to his terror, he slipped on the Ring.     The world of light faded, and Frodo suddenly saw the black shapes for what they were: nightmarish victims of other Rings, their souls forever enslaved, and not just minorities after all. One of them wore a pale crown. Yet even as he saw them they surged forward.     The Ringwraiths pressed a small envelope into Frodo's hand, then stepped back. Frodo opened it, looked briefly at the page then fell back with a cry of despair. With his last strength he refolded the letter before blackness overtook him.
  When Frodo came to he was still clutching the folded letter desperately. His companions were stumbling around, feeling for him and cursing him quitevividly.  "Frodo? Fro-o-do?"  "Frodo! Frodo! Where is that addlepate?"  "Master Frodo! Master! Oh, Frodo, me dear, me dear! This is your Samcalling for you! You still owe me two weeks' wages, dammit!"  "You should have agreed to suck his fingers," mumbled Strider.  "You're a fine one to scold!" flared Sam, whose suspicions of Strider hadbeen amply confirmed. "Don't you think I realize you helped those Ridersfind us? Did they bribe you to do so?"  "Er... yes," said Stider. "I have to get money from somewhere, and youcheapskates are not directly assisting."  "Traitor!" shouted Frodo. They all turned towards the sound of his voice.  "All right, Frodo," said Morrie coldly. "You can take off the Ring now."  Frodo obliged and said accusingly to Strider: "I trusted you to take us toRivendell!"  "And I will," said Strider unconcernedly. "But you can't blame me if Iearn a bit of money on the way. Well, you can if you want to, but I couldn'tcare less. And now that they have given you that piece of paper I think theNazdaq will leave us alone for a while."  "Yes, the paper!" shouted Pipsqueak. "What is that piece of paper you holdin your hand? Tell us what that paper is! What's on that paper? Tell us,tell us, tell us!"  Frodo gave him a tired glance. "You're an even bigger nuisance than thathalf-brother of yours, Fatty Bolger," he said.  "Well, what is it, anyway?" asked Morrie.  Frodo ground his teeth. "It's a letter from a law firm called Goatleg,Goose &amp; Gander," he answered. "They inform me that my distant relative HippoBaggins has died and left me his estate by Lake Nurnen, and his title. (Hebelonged to a southern branch of hobbits.) He was terribly rich, being aracist slave-trader in Haradrim and Easterlings, and I am now Sir FrodoBaggins of Moneybags Hall, Nurnenshire."  "Well, what's so awful about that?" demanded Morrie. "A nice estate inMordor is nothing to turn up your nose at, particularly since you can't everreturn to the Shire. The creditors Gandalf got for you would tear you topieces."  "Of course I want the estate!" shouted Frodo. "But the paper says I mustappear in the local court in Mordor within two weeks after receiving thispaper, or else forfeit my inheritance! It will go to the state, that is tosay to Sauron, instead" He turned accusingly towards Strider. "That's whythe Black Riders really tried to get hold of me! They are working forSauron. AND YOU HELPED THEM!"  "For a consideration," said Strider calmly. "And for a consideration, I'llhelp you come into your inheritance."  "But I have to get to that court within two weeks!" stormed Frodo. "Andthere is no way I can do that, unless the Eagles carry me there." Hestopped, obviously struck by an idea. Then he said to Strider: "Would theEagles do that? Could you summon them -"  "No," said Strider decisively. "The eagles will NOT carry you to Mordor.They are not some kind of talking aircabs. But if you get to Rivendellwithin two weeks, El Rond, as a local magistrate, can grant you a defermentabout appearing at that court. I'll help you get to Rivendell in time, ifyou'll just sign this little IOU." He held forth a piece of paper. Frodotook it, read it and reeled backwards with a shout.  "Fifty thousand gold coins! You want fifty thousand gold coins to help meget there in time!"  "And it's legally binding for both of us," remarked Strider, studying hisfingernails. He gave Frodo a keen glance. "I really do not see how youwill be able to make it to Rivendell without my help. Or with me workingaginst you," he added with a light, jocular laugh which chilled the blood ofthe hobbits.  "OK, you blood-sucker," groaned Frodo. He signed the paper and tossed itback to Strider. "There!"  Strider looked carefully at the document before stowing it away. "We'llmove out now," he declared. "I think we have had enough of Gambletop."  "I want to know what the Black Riders looked like!" shouted Pipsqueak. Theothers looked at him in distaste.  "Oh, very well," said Frodo. "I'll tell you anything if you will just shutup after that. They were dressed all in black... black all the way. One ofthem seemed to be dressed in nothing except black lingerie."  "Yes," said Strider. "A couple of them are into crossdressing. One of themactually likes to disguise himself as Arwen, my fiancé. And he's quite goodat it; he won a contest for Arwen imitators some years ago."  "One of them had a pale crown."  "That would be the Leech-king. He went bald thousands of years ago, and henever walks under the sun, so of course his crown is pale."  "Well, I agree about getting off this hill," said Morrie. "I don't likethe wind. I think it's going to rain."  "Or snow," said Strider. "In that case we might see the Sand-Orcs throwsnowballs at each other. Some peope come here to watch it."  "Well, I don't," said Morrie.  "My point is that a day's march from here is the Forsaken Inn, whichcaters to the tourists. If we start now we might be there in time forsupper." Strider rubbed his stomach. "I'm so hungry!" he moaned. "I haven'teaten properly since we left the Prancing Pony."The evening saw them installed at the Forsaken Inn, which was run by achuckling, cold-eyed man called Benjamin Butterball, the brother of Barlimanat the Prancing Pony. Before they arrived there, Strider had warned themabout this fact and advised them not to flaunt the towels they had stolenfrom Barliman. After having paid in advance, they sat down to a meal offried Mûmak's ear with Gondorean fries and garlic butter, though Strider'sslobbering, greedy way of wolfing down his food made the others lose theirappetite.  "If you keep eating like that you'll be known as Waddler instead," Morriesaid to him. Strider glared at him and then defiantly ordered butteredmuffins with his after-dinner coffee.  "Why didn't the Nazdaq take the Ring from Frodo?" asked Pipsqueak. Sincethis was actually a quite clever question, nobody glared at him.  "Aparently, those three didn't know that Frodo carries the Ring. They areeven more stupid than their master, thank Eru," said Strider through a hugemouthful of muffins while melted butter dribbled down his chin. The sightwas so disgusting that the others left the able and went to bed.The following morning saw Strider complaining at the breakfast table aboutthe fact that the inn did not serve Choco-Frosted Sugar Bombs. For somereason, this made the others enjoy their toast and marmalade more than theymight possibly have done otherwise. Frodo improved his mood further bysmuggling Westfarthing Chinook into his coffee; when they once more hit theroad he was decidedly tipsy.  "Sam, why don't you recite a poem for us?" he burbled as he staggered lastin line down the road.  "Very well, Master Frodo," said Sam with a faint sneer. "I hope you likethis one." He began to sing to an old tune.            Squire, the fool, he sat on his stool,            counting his gains as a plutocrat's tool;                For many a year he had gnawed the poor,                    For gold was all he cared for.                        Cared for! Dared for!            In his house on the hill he dwelt alone,                    For gold was all he cared for.            Up came Tom with his big boots on.            Said he to the squire: "Pray, what is yon?                For it looks like the coins o' my nuncle Tim,                    Who belonged to the struggling masses,                        Classes! Asses!                This many a year has Tim been gone,                    Who belonged to the struggling masses."            "My lad," said Squire, "this gold I stole.            But what be bones that lie in a hole?                Thy nuncle owed me for food and rent,                   To pay for that his coins he spent.                        I lent! He went!            He can spare a share for a poor old mole,                For his money for better folks was meant."            Said Tom: "I don't see why the likes o' thee            Without axin' leave should go makin' free                With the money belongs to my father's kin:                    So hand the mazuma over!                        Rover! Trover!                Though dead he be, it belongs to me;                    So hand the mazuma over!"            "For a couple o' pins," says Squire, and grins,            "I'll flay thee too, and gnaw thy skins.                A bit o' fresh mint will go down sweet!                    I'll try my bailiff on thee now.                        See how! Cash cow!                I'm tired of gnawing old bones and skins;                    I've a mind to plunder thee now."            But just as he thought his profit was caught,            He found his hands had hold of naught.                Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind                    And gave him the boot to larn him.                        Warn him! Darn him!                A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thought,                    Would be the way to larn him.            The class-conscious prole took back what Squire stole            and hanged him and buried him in a hole.                We'll kick the toffs from their fancy homes,                    And give them the rope to still them.                        Kill them! Fill them!                Yes, we Reds will take back what the Squires stole,                    And give them the rope to still them.  "Well, that's a warning to us all!" laughed Morrie. "That will be the day,eh, Sam, lad?"  "It will indeed, and no mistake," said Sam darkly. They walked on insilence, Frodo hiccoughing.The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was nosign of any other travellers to be seen, but suddenly they heard a soundbehind them: a strange, rattling, coughing sound. While they hesitated, adilapidated old T-Ford came in sight. As it drew nearer they saw that a hugefrog was sitting behind the wheel. The car stopped and the frog got out.  "Haista paska!" it shouted. This is a vulgar term in an Elvish dialect androughly means: "Ah, you at last!"  "Haista paska yourself," answered Morrie. "And who may you be?"  "I'm Morton the Frog," declared the driver, "and I have been sent by ElRond to help you."  "Help us?" said Strider. "He sent a frog to help us?"  "Do not underestimate the green side of the frog," said Morton. "Kiss meand find out!"  Strider was about to answer something intemperate, but checked himself.Suddenly, a strange gleam lit in his eyes. To the amazement of the others,he strode (or possibly waddled) up to the frog, grasped it in his arms andkissed it. The frog turned into Arwen, the Elven princess.  They all stared at her in silence. When Arwen had been born, she had beena very beautiful maid, but that was thousands of years ago. With everymortal life span she laid to her age, she had also added the beauty of onemortal maid. To put it another way, she was by now very good-looking indeed.  The effect on the rest of the company was stunning, but Frodo was filledwith madness. For the first time he truly realized what sex was all about.Suddenly, as in a dream, he saw once more Cassiopeia Took's benippledglories in front of him, like two enchanted bombs of desire. There was aroar of passion in his ears; it was drowned by the piercing cries of hisblood as it carried him away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, and theroaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him. He heard and saw nomore.
     "So you're going to go through with it, then," Gandalf the Wizard said slowly.     "I am," Bilbo replied. "I've been planning this for a long time. It'll give the Hobbits of the Shire something to talk about for the next nine days - or ninety-nine, more likely. Anyway, at least I'll have my little joke."     "Who will laugh, I wonder?" Gandalf mused aloud, scratching his beard idly.     For weeks carts and caravans were coming from all over Middle-earth to bring provisions for the Grand Old Party, as Bilbo referred to it. Wagons of food from the Dwarvish mines at Erebor, shiny rocks from the Sea-elves and fancy seductive packages from southern Mirkwood arrived daily, making the neighborhood generally more crowded and cluttering up avenues. Even those who hadn't said anything bad about Bilbo before were starting to show their annoyance. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is starting to get a mite annoying," old Gaffer Gamgee grumbled, standing outside the pub. "Queer goings-on, and no mistake. Why just yesterday a bunch o' pesky Wood-elves dragged their cart right acrost my yard and ruined my taters!"     "A bunch of Men from Bree came to my place yesterday and tried to sell me some aluminum siding," mused Old Noakes of Bywater. "They said it was because they had extra after building that horrible Quonset hut over the Party Tree, and they were trying to unload it. Strange folk hereabouts."     "Yes, but it's good for the economy," sneered Bill Ferny, the local banker. "A lot more money in circulation. Market's been doing well. Unionization is down because of all the entry-level service positions that are being created. Widening gap between the haves and have-nots, don't you think? Good to find work for idle hands."     "And you don't know nothin' about anythin', Ferny," Gaffer Gamgee snapped, echoing the popular community sentiment. "Mr. Bilbo Baggins is a right bastard, as I've often said, and it's small wonder if trouble don't come of him and his imperialist ways. The Revolution's a'comin', and it's the likes o'you who'll be the first ag'inst the wall, so sayeth the Lord." And with that he spat a well-aimed beer-nut into Ferny's glass.     At last the day of the Big Party arrived. Everywhere there was too much to eat, and by midafternoon there were broken presents lying all over the Shire attesting to the low quality of their manufacture. Gandalf set off a series of fireworks later on in the day, including great skywriting missiles and little flaming butterflies who took to wing, sailed off into the Eastfarthing and burned all its trees to the ground.     The last firework sent up a great black smoke which took the shape of a giant mountain of fire. A flicker could be seen of a giant dragon sailing about its peak; after a moment the great dragon went sailing over the heads of the crowd, causing great panic and consternation and six outright heart attacks before imploding somewhere over the Sackville-Baggins' neighborhood, causing considerable property damage which was never properly repaired for generations afterward.     "That is the signal for supper!" Bilbo cried out to the survivors, who were only partly mollified.     Later on, in the specially-designed quonset hut which Bilbo had built especially for the occasion, all his friends and neighbors were helping themselves to their third helpings of macaroni and cheese and potato salad (the latter laced liberally with what Bilbo called the "traditional secret ingredient", which while not actually a narcotic still had unusual effects, the sum of which were still under scientific inquiry in some circles), Bilbo stood up and motioned for quiet. "A speech! A speech!" some of his neighbors cried out in fear.     My dear Hobbits! Bilbo began. There was much cheering at this, as Hobbits on the whole are a rather egocentric lot, and anyway the latest round of potato salad was beginning to kick in.     My dear Bagginses and Bracegirdles, Boffins and Borfledebees, Casmits and Cantankerums, Fassbinders and Fazoolas, Wombats and Wafflefoots. "WaffleFEET!" cried out an irate old man at the back, in fact the very man who had earned the name when Bilbo's nephew Frodo had accidentally dropped a hot waffle-iron on his feet some years ago. He had borne the Bagginses no ill-will, since the settlement was quite generous.     Wafflefoots, continued Bilbo, oblivious. This is my nine hundreth birthday! And though one million years is too short a time to have spent with you all...     There was some muffled conversation throughout the hall, which Bilbo took notice of. Well, on bad days it seems like a million years, he explained. Anyway, though ten billion years is long enough to endure from all of you, this is IT... I am GOING... I am leaving NOW... GoodBYE! And with that Bilbo leaped up, tore all his clothes off, scattering them about the astonished guests' heads, and ran from the great Hut screaming and flailing his arms.     Young Frodo looked on in bemusement, refusing to answer questions from the astonished crowd. Everyone knew, of course, that Bilbo was a big man in the community. But - and Frodo looked at the crowd, particularly noting the astonishment on old Lobelia's face - until now, nobody knew just how big.     "Well! That's done!" Bilbo laughed, emerging from the bedroom at Bag End freshly dressed. "You know, Gandalf, I've been wanting to do that for as long as I can remember. Now I think this would be an excellent time to leave the Shire, at least before they can all find their torches and axe-handles. Everything stays with Frodo, as we promised."     "Including the Ring?" Gandalf asked.     "Well, yes, I suppose so," Bilbo replied. He pulled the Ring out from under his cloak, where it hung on a fine golden chain Bilbo had stolen of old from the Brandybucks. "Still, though, I kind of hate to get rid of it."     "This seemed to me to be the only thing worthwhile about your whole stupid plan," Gandalf said uncharacteristically. "Put it on the mantel and walk away from it. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!"     "It's mine! And I shall keep it, I say!"     Gandalf raised himself up to his full height. Bilbo's hand reached quietly for the hilt of his sword. "It will be my turn to get angry soon," the wizard intoned. "Listen to me: you must give Frodo the Ring!"     Bilbo suddenly laughed. "Oh, that?" he grinned. "Well, of course I'm giving him the Ring! I thought you meant the chain." Slipping the Ring off the chain he set the circle of gold on the mantel without a second thought. Then he slipped the chain about his neck. "I love this chain. Stole it from old Matuseck Brandybuck back before he went senile. Wouldn't part with it for love nor money. No, I don't give two flies about the Ring. Nothing but trouble, that thing has been.     "Well, I'm off, Gandalf! I'm off on the road again, and not a moment too soon by the look of that crowd down there." And taking an old walking-stick from the stand by the door Bilbo went outside, taking a path around the back of the Hill so he could leave unobserved, and as he left he began singing a song quietly to himself:      While often by the door I lie      And look upon the mountains' feet      And think of rains and hikers' pains      And sleeping wetly in the sleet,      When darkness' cry does terrify      And wilderness encircles you,      And being food for goblins' brood      Is one choice, and starvation two;      Then staying home instead of roam      Will have a very great appeal!      Forego the Quest! And have a rest!      Let Dwarves and Elves and wizards squeal!      But since the Shire is filled with ire,      And all my neighbors fevers grip,      It's plain to see! I must agree!      The time has come to take a trip!     Hours later Frodo returned to Bag End, a little glad to have thrown off the pursuit at last. He started at first to discover someone waiting for him in the living-room, but sighed with relief when he saw it was only Gandalf.     "Did he get away?" Frodo asked.     "He did," Gandalf replied. "And just at the last, for they were getting ready to set after him with dogs. Luckily he doubled back at the Three-Farthing Stone, as I recommended, or there would be a special bonfire in Tuckborough tonight. Are you well?"     "Yes," Frodo replied. "I managed to convince everyone I was uninvolved with the Hay Incident."     "Good," Gandalf said. He lit his pipe with a nearby candle and looked at Frodo evenly. "He left things for you on the mantel. The deed to Bag End, a signed statement saying you were only an unwitting accomplice in the Bywater Incident, and-"     "The Ring!" Frodo said, looking at the mantel with astonishment. "Has he left me that?"     "He has," Gandalf replied, "though you'll have to find a new chain. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own - don't use it! Now or later! It may have other powers besides quick and easy seduction."     "I can't believe Bilbo left me the Ring," Frodo gasped. "He used to say that it and a bottle of Westfarthing Chinook was all you needed for the perfect weekend."     "Well, lock it up someplace and stay away from it," Gandalf intoned. "No Took-wives, no Elf-virgins, and no real estate deals. And no political aspirations! In the morning I'm off to see if I can learn more about it. In the meantime leave it unused until I return."     "I'll, uh, I'll think about that, all right," Frodo blurted, trying hard not to think about the Ring and young Cassiopiea Took.     The next morning Gandalf left, leaving Frodo with only his thoughts, his yearnings and a half-empty bottle of Westfarthing Chinook for company.

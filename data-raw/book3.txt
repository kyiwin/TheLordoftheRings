  Aragon raced up the hill, following the trail of Boromir's blood.  "If I read that sign aright," he said to himself, looking at the largesign pointing at the summit, with "SUMMIT" in large runes written on it,"that is the way to the summit."  He ran up to the summit, not pausing until he reached the top. There hefound the palantir, which was rumoured to have been made by the famed Feenamint Industries Plc. itself. Swiftly he inserted a quarter, and placed his eye to the eyepiece, and started to point the device at the boats, for hesuspected Frodo would be going there.  But even as he sought the boats with the device, a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills, just as Mordred violated his parole in once doing.  "Alas! The horn of Boromir," he said, "Hmm, I suppose I'd better make my way down there. Besides, this is just unartistic anyway."  For although Aragon would be pleased to get Boromir out of the way, it could be, how shall we put it, inconvenient if he was known to be directly responsible.  Unsheathing his sword, and crying Endurit! Endurit! he ran all the waydown the hill again, and crashed through the trees, to find Boromir immobile, and lying against a mediocre tree, his cloven horn beside him.  Aragon knelt beside him and tried to rouse him. But, Boromir did not move.  "Yay!", cheered Aragon, his delight undisguised. "Thus passes the heir ofDenethor, Lord of the Tower of Commerce! One down, two to go!"  "I heard that!" said Boromir, slowly.  "Bother," said Aragon. "But since you're alive, you might as well makeyourself useful. What happened here? What happened to those halflings who were supposed to be guarding you?  And more importantly, where is Arwen?"  "Orcs have taken them," said Boromir, struggling. "Arwen too, I think,"he lied, remembering where Aragon's priorities lay.  "Which way did they go?" asked Aragon.  "Dunno. I passed out," said Boromir. "Blood loss, you see."  Aragon cursed viciously and loudly. Thus it was Lego-lass and Giggly foundhim. Giggly had his axe in hand, and Lego-lass her long knife; all her arrowswere spent.  "Alas!", said Lego-lass, standing well back from Aragon. "I have hunted andslain-"  "Oi!", interjected Giggly. "Don't you mean 'we'?"  "I didn't see you do any slaying, shortarse. Or hunting for that matter."  "Oh yeah? So why do you think there were so many detached Orc heads around the place?"  "It's quite clear that-"  Tiring of this, Aragon drew his sword, and waved it around quite menacingly. "Can I get some attention round here?... Thank you," he said at the sudden and quite expected silence. "Now, Boromir here is dead."  "No I'm not!" objected Boromir.  "Yes you are, you'll be stone dead in a minute," said Aragon, kickingBoromir firmly. "Thanks for your concern," he sarcasmed, "but I am Okay,because I only just got here. But it seems that Arwen has been captured bythe enemy.  We must pursue immediately."  "But what about the halflings?" asked Lego-lass.  "They, too, were captured. Alas, we do not know for certain whether theRing-bearer is with them, but we must assume the worst."  "Yes, Frodo was with them," lied Boromir. "Now will someone help me up?"  "Come, let us go," said Aragon.  "Hadn't we better tend to the fallen first?" asked Lego-lass.  "But we must be swift," said Giggly. "He would not wish us to linger."  "What I want is to be taken to Minas Tirith!" declared Boromir.  "Very well," said Aragon. Although he did not like the delay, it was, perhaps, best to deal with Boromir. "We will lay you in a boat with your weapons and give you to Anduin. Then you shall pass to Disgiliath safely."  "No I won't!" exclaimed Boromir. "There's a waterfall in the way! It's notnavigable."  "Ah, but our boats are from Lorien. They are magical, right? Magical boats can safely go down waterfalls," blustered Aragon. "Well known fact, that," hethen added.  "Indeed," said Lego-lass, vaguely suspecting that Aragon did not know the truth of his words, but not daring to say.  They then turned their attention to the fallen Orcs, looking to scavengewhat they could. Lego-lass took all the undamaged arrows she could find,whilst Giggly collected all the shuriken which had been strangely left underthe orc bodies.  And Aragon did look upon the slain, and he did say, "I don't recognise theuniform of these Orcs," for they had shields with the device of a graspingwhite hand in the centre of a black field, and on the front of their helmetsthey had an S-rune.  "S is for Sauron," said Giggly. "That's not exactly hard to figure out."  "Nay, you idiot!" said Lego-lass, "Sauron does not use the Elf-runes, forhe failed to pay the royalties and we got an injunction, which he got roundby using Dwarf-runes, which the Dwerrowsii were only too happy to sell to him-"  "That's unfair-", shot back Giggly.  "Nor does he permit his right name to be spelt or spoken," said Aragon. "And white is not in his colour-scheme, for it makes it easy to see the dirt.The Orcs in the service of Barad-dur use the sign of the Bloodshot Eye."  He pondered a moment. "It's a bit confusing really. I can't think of any bad guys whose names start with S apart from Sauron."  "Shelob?" suggested Giggly.  "I doubt she'd have an army of Orcs, even if she really does exist. No, Ithink what's happened here is a failed attempt at deception. Obviouslythese are someone else's forces, perhaps Aruman's, but he wants to decieveus into thinking they are Sauron's. But because it was done amateurishly,the deception has failed. Sauron will not be happy if he finds out."  Later, the remainder of the company dragged Boromir to where theyhad left the boats, but found only the destroyed remnants of the boats.  "Alas!" said Aragon. "An ill fate is on us today."  "Orcs. Must be. No-one else would have destroyed the boats," said Giggly.  They retrieved what they could find of their baggage, and then fashioneda crude raft from the boat wreckage. Now, they tied Boromir to this, andmade doubly sure the knots were secure, but first taking the precaution of knocking him cold. Then, they pushed the raft from the shore out into the water and the raft floated south. They watched the raft wane to a dark spot against the golden light, and then the screams started.  "No! You can't do this to me! I'm the Heir to the Stewardship of Gondor,you know! I demand you-".   But he was interrupted by the waterfall. The raft vanished downwards. TheRiver had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was out of the way,at least for the moment.  "And now, we must follow the Orcs, for they have Arwen," said Aragon. "Oh, and the ringbearer," he added.  It was easy to find the trail of the Orcs, for it was littered with crisppackets and chewing gum wrappers.  "No other folk leave such a mess," said Lego-lass. "But the Orcs havean alliance with the Litter Pickers' Union, who are glad of the extra work."  "But although they are messy, they are very fast. We shall have to go withwinged speed to catch up," said Aragon, and ran off as fast as he could, with Lego-lass and Giggly following.
  Merciful Elbereth, is this the end of Little Arwen?  The annoying but loveable Elven Warrior Princess was travellingtowards Gondor, but had lost her way in the marshes of Ment-wash vale. The fog surrounded her from all sides, and with everystep she was in danger of being swallowed by the bog. She hadbeen forced to abandon all her packings, and her strength wasdiminishing quickly. Finally she collapsed on a small isle in themiddle of the marshes. She knew that she could go on no more.The Marshes of Mentwash vale had defeated her.  Then an image came to her mind, like a foresight at the momentof Death; Aragon holding hands with a blond Human-Girl, a tall andwell-equipped one too - with sword and all. And suddenly she felther strength returning. She forced herself to rise and cursed in anancient, forgotten tongue: Tega me borne rosa!  With her newly found determination she continued her dangerousjourney, and soon she came across a great stroke of luck, whichno-one could have expected.  Aragon knew all was lost. He couldn't find the trail of Orcs, andsoon his companions were sure to discover this. After that nobodywould take him seriously ever again.  Who could have guessedtracking would turn out to be so difficult? But there was nothing tobe done. The hills of Emyn Mail had defeated him.  But in his most desperate hour, he came across a great stroke ofluck... Well anyway, he was examining the ground, trying to look ashe knew what he was doing, when:  "Oh, lookie! There are some dead Orcs up ahead," cried Lego-lass.  Aragon sprang to his feet and gazed to the direction Lego-lasswas pointing. And lo! Indeed there was a bunch of dead orcs lyingin a pile. He went forward to investigate, and others followed him.  Five dead orcs lay there, brutally slain, severed limbs and headsspreaded around them. The ground was wet with their dark blood,but there was no telling if the blood had been red earlier.  "What do you think happened here?" said Giggly.  "It looks like there's been a quarrel among Orcs," said Aragon."It's not uncommon among these foul creatures to have flamingdebates about issues like Balrogs wings and it usually ends up tothis. These five are all northern Orcs who claim Balrogs don't havewings. It appears they lost this round."  "Serves them right for speaking such nonsense," declared Lego-lass. Aragon was about to contridict, when Giggly interrupted him.  "Look!" he cried. " A silver magical belt of Elvish fashion like those given to Morrie and Pipsqueak by Galadriel."  "Hmm, the Orcs must have noticed they are fakes. . ."  "Wait! There's a note attached to it," said Lego-lass. "It is amessage from the Hobbits. The handwriting looks like of 7-yearold, so I think it's from Pipsqueak. Listen!                      A Message From The Hobbits       I am writing to you with the courtesy of the Enemy.       We are both alive and well.       We are treated decently.       Food here is delicious and nourishing.       The Orcs are peace-loving and friendly folk, and       their Lord, (S)Aruman only wishes to discuss briefly       about our attitude toward his Subpoena and other issues.       After this, we shall be released at proper time.       DO NOT try to follow us. We're having a good time. Really.       Be also noted that as it was recently decided, at this place,       Balrogs DO have w-       No, I wont write that! You can't make me! No! NO!       AAAARGGHHHHH!!!!  Everyone fell silent for a while. Finally Aragon spoke.  "So, Aruman is behind this as I suspected. Apparently he thinkshis name should be written with S. Old fool!  "But why doesn't the letter say anything about Arwen or the otherHobbits? What evil plot is Aruman hatching?"  "Yes, and why would anyone write AARGGH, instead of saying it?"  "We won't find out by standing here," said Aragon. "Let us hurry!"  Fortunately for Aragon the trail was very clearly marked from thereon, and he had no trouble following it to the top of the hills. This wasthe border wall of Rohan, where the hills of Emyn Mail ended andthe green plains of Riddlemark stretched below them to the edgeof sight. But Aragon looked to the left, where the Off-White Mountainsstood glimmering in the morning sun.  "Gondor! Gondor!" cried Aragon. "I wish that I could visityour night-clubs again in Happy-Hour! Alas, not yet can I relax.            Gondor, Gondor, Gondor!            It's the country where I liked to be.            Between the Mountains and Sea,            So near to Mordor, yet so far from Bree.            Gondor, Gondor, Gondor!            Where the Trading Markets are free.            There's a throne and the Silver Tree,            And maybe a Crown for Me!Now let's go before I change my mind!" he said and turned away.  The ridge upon which they stood went down steeply in front ofthem and Aragon was trying to look for the best place to go down,when a shadow like two wings went pass the sunlight.  "Look!" cried Lego-lass. "A Balrog! A Balrog is flying above us!Ai! Ai!- you know the drill."  "Would you stop that already!" said Aragon. "It was just an Eagle."  "No, no, it was a Balrog, I'm sure of that!" insisted Lego-lass. "Ithad legs and arms and I think it waved at us when it went by. Oh,this is amazing! To tell you the truth, I've sometimes had doubtsabout it, but now I've seen it with my own eyes. A flying Balrog!Oh, what a glorious day!"  Oo-kay. Lego-lass has gone bye-bye, thought Aragon. Whatan ill fortune, and I'm already depressed.  After Lego-lass had calmed down they made their way down thehillside, but halfway down Giggly lost his balance and, trying to get support from the others, he sent the whole threesome rolling down. And so, with a strange suddenness  they came together on the grass of Rohan.  Lego-lass took a deep breath and exhaled. "Everything looks sogree-een," she said, blinking her eyes.  "Now the real Pursuit begins," declared Aragon. "We shall catchthose Orcs, and forever shall our names be remembered amongElves, Humans and Dwerws. Onward, three Predators!"  They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent ofa poor helpless fox, hunted to the pleasure of rich dimwits. Soon,however, they had to stop, for they were terribly out of shape andalready exhausted. Only Lego-lass was as perky as ever.  Aragon breathed heavily. "My lungs are collapsing," he said."I really should quit smoking pipeweed."  "This is a bitter end to all our toil!" said Giggly. "At least I hope it is."  "To toil maybe, but we can always hope that those Orcs run intosome kind of trouble," said Lego-lass. "Look!"  This time there was more then dozen cruelly mutilated Orc-corpseson their path. It looked like many were cut down from behind.  "What do you think, Aragon?" said Lego-lass. "Looks like anotherBalrog-debate."  "Not necessarily," said Aragon. "Orcs have hundreds of undecidedissues to debate and they all can turn into a bloodshed. You know,with some luck these Orcs may yet flame each other extinct. Anyway,I think it's clear that we are not going to reach them in time, so fromnow on we will take things a little more easily."  They went on, this time with no rush. Every now and then more Orc-corpses came their way. Giggly and Lego-lass discovered thatcounting dead Orcs aloud seemed to really irritate Aragon. Whenthey made camp for the night, their bodycount was way over fifty.  In the middle of the night something mighty queer went on. Aragonwas half-asleep, listening to the voices of Lego-lass and Giggly. TheElf-Maid was persisting in something and Giggly was rejecting her, but his objections sounded less and less convincing. Suddenly Aragonseemed to realize that someone was crawling next to him. Then hefelt two soft hands touching him gently. Still not sure if he was awakeor dreaming, he tried weakly to struggle against it, but then he hearda familiar voice whispering softly: "Stop resisting my love, you knowyou want it. And this is such a good spot for a Love Scene."  Aragon wasn't so sure about it, but then he thought, Why not. Theycan always edit it out if need be.  When morning came all was peaceful again. Aragon woke up stillunsure if he had dreamed the whole thing. Then he noticed a curiously sticky feeling in his pants, but it was only a melted candy-bar he had forgotten in his pocket.  Everybody seemed strangely quiet that day, as they walked by thebeautiful but empty golf-courses of Rohan. Both Aragon and Gigglywere concentrating on their inner thoughts and were paying only alittle attention to the outside world.  Giggly was struggling with a major identity crisis. Every now andthen his eyes wandered to the figure of the fair Elf-Maid walking infront of him. Desperately he tried to fight the thoughts coming to hismind.  I am not an Elf-Lover, he kept saying to himself. Am not, am not,am not! It's just the pressure of the journey getting to me. It's likebeing in the sea for many months without a sight of a Lady-Dwarf.It would happen to anyone! I am just like all others, a healthynormal Dwarf-Guy, keen on Dwerrow-lasses. That's right, definitelyright. Beard is sexy, beard is sexy, beard is sexy, oh Oolee lookat those legs!  Who the heck was killing all those Orcs? Aragon was thinking tohimself. Were they really just fighting with themselves? Or wasthere a group of Riders attacking them? And who molested me lastnight, or was it just a dream? The questions kept bouncing aroundhis head, until he came up with a most unsuspected answer. Arwen!What if Boromir had been lying when he said Arwen was capturedtoo? Maybe she came to the camp later and, thinking they had goneto Gondor, followed them. And then she could have found anEagle, willing to give her a lift right here! And with her magic bootsshe could have moved around fast enough to kill the Orcs and thento seduce me last night! That's probably what had happened.  Then he came to his senses and shook his head in despair. Itwas simply too farfetched. Not believable at all! Truth was thatArwen was a helpless prisoner of merciless Orcs without a chanceof escape, and he was equally incapable of helping her. Tearsburned in his eyes, as he walked along without seeing anything.  Only Lego-lass seemed free of all care, walking with a delicategrace over the grasslands, singing softly some less-known Elven-songs about interracial love-affairs.  Two more days went by this way. Nobody came to Aragon at night-time, but dead Orcs still kept blocking the path regulaly. Then, onthe fourth day of their "pursuit", a thunderous roar of galloping hoofsawoke them from their afternoon siesta.  Aragon yawned and streched himself. "Lego-lass, be a dear andcheck out who's coming," he said lazily.  "Well, there seems to be a group of Riders coming our way," saidthe Elf-Maid. "Four scores and seven of them, to be exact. Theyare tall, yellow haired humans and their leader is. . . is. . . Oh,c'mon! This is getting ridiculous!"  The others sprang to their feet. They gazed at the approachinghorsemen, trying to see what had so upset Lego-lass. Soon itbecame obvious to them also.  The Riders formed a circle around the three companions. Thenthe Leader rode forward and halted in front of them.  "Suprised to see me?" she asked.  "Not much, Eowynn," said Aragon. "It should have been clear toeveryone that you were not going to settle for being dropped tosecond place in the upcoming movie."  Eowynn, who by the way was a great-looking, six foot tall blonde,tried to look as innocent as she could.  "I don't know what you're talking about," she said. "There weresome Orcs running around our courses and they needed to betaken care of. I only came because my brother Eonerd was busytrying to get Cable Connection fixed."  "You mean...?"  "Just that! Ever since that horse came back from Gandalf, it'sbeen completely off-line.  "But enough of that. It seems that somebody went up ahead andalready killed most of the Orcs, so I guess I'll have to settle for you.Here! You are illegally tresspassing the Green Fields of Rohan®.Do you have anything to say, before we run you over?"  Giggly stepped forward. "I have something to say to you, Horse-Lady," he said and his dark eyes flashed.  "Well?"  A short pause...  "Please don't kill us! Pleeease! I'll do anything! Did you hear?Anything!"  Eowynn looked at the Dwarf and shivered. "I think I'll pass that,"she said. "Prepare to die!"  "Uh, did I mention that I am Aragon son of Arathon, Elessar theElvenstone and the Heir of Isildur?" said Aragon quickly. "If youshould consider letting us go, I could make it worthwhile to you assoon as I get my Kingdom back."  "Hmm, let's see if we can work out an agreement," said Eowynn.  Eowynn dismounted, and she and Aragon walked a little bit awayfrom the others. Eowynn looked quickly to be sure no-one was closeenough to hear them.  "Can you get me a Green Card?" she said to Aragon. "As a King,you can surely pull a few strings and get it arranged."  "What?!"  "I wanna move to Gondor," Eowynn explained. "I don't wantto spend my whole life, living among these bagpipe-playingrednecks. I am a modern, independent woman and I have otherambitions beside riding around and tending golf-courses. But Ineed the Working-Licence so that I can start my own business inGondor. Can you get me one?"  "Uh, I'm afraid, that's the one thing not even a King can do. ThoseGondorians have strong feelings about immigration. If I tried some-thing like that, I would have Revolution in my hands within a week."  "Then there is no hope for me," said Eowynn bitterly. "Sigh.I might as well ride into battle to seek Death."  "Well, there is one way, of course," said Aragon. "I could arrangeyou a Convenial Marriage with some Gondorian. Then you'd haveno problem getting the Green Card. But first you have to get your-self to Gondor somehow, and that's not going to be easy."  "I guess I could do that," said Eowynn after hesitation. "But it hasto be someone with social status. A Lawyer maybe. Or a Doctor."  "So, it is settled then?" said Aragon.  Eowynn looked intensely at the man standing in front of her. Andsuddenly she could see the great strength and royality that wasconcealed inside his bit overweight and slobbish body, like a V6-engine under the hood of a T-model Ford. She took a hold of hishands, and he felt that she trembled at the touch.  "Why don't you marry me then?" she said, looking deeply in hiseyes. "And not just for cover-up, for I can see that we were meantfor each other. Come with me to the Edoras-City and we can haveour wedding right away."  "Eowynn, you are a beautiful and desirable woman," said Aragoncarefully. "Alas, my heart belongs to another! And since she was aprisoner of those Orcs, we both were pursuing, I must go and seekher."  "But your quest is a hopeless one. If she was with the Orcs, whenwe surrounded the last of them near the Forest, she was probablykilled and burned with the others. Um, sorry about that..."  "Nevertheless, I must see it with my own eyes," said Aragon.  Then something less important came to his mind. "You didn't bychance happen to find a Ring, did you? A nice golden thing, on achain. No, huh? Oh, it was nothing important."  "I am saddened by this," said Eowynn. "But if this is your choice,I will accept it. But promise me, that you will come to Edoras-City,when your quest is over."  Thus agreeing they parted. As a part of their agreement Eowynnlent them the three spare horses, but for some reason Lego-lass and Giggly wanted to ride on a same horse. They took thethird one along anyway, for Arwen and the Hobbits (should they find them).  When the Riders had disappeared from the sight, Giggly andLego-lass wanted to know how Aragon had been able to convinceEowynn to let them go.  "Well, it wasn't easy," said Aragon modestly. "But when I said toher that Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear and it's aman's part to discern them, she was so impressed that she agreedto everything I suggested."  This made everybody laugh out loud, as they rode forward in abright daylight, and Aragon was happy that he managed to avoidany further inquires.  Early that evening, they came to the edge of the forest. They foundthe remains of the great burning, and tried searching for the Ring inthe ashes, but found nothing. Also, not a single trace could tell themif anyone could have escaped from the battlefield, but we mustremember that Aragon was lousy at woodcraft.  Aragon was heartbroken. Arwen is dead, he thought hopelessly.And even though she may one day reincarnate in the West, I willnever see her again. It seemed like all the joy and happiness hadleft his life, and all that remained was Misery.  Then he remembered Eowynn. She was a good-looking babe, andshe obviously got the hots for him. Maybe all was not lost after all.  "Tomorrow we shall ride to Edoras-City," he said to others."I have an Indecent Proposal to be made."  But during the night their horses were stolen or driven away.Suspicions turned to an Old Man, whom they had seen snoopingaround the camp, and whom Aragon had called "Uncle".
   Pipsqueak lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that hecould hear his own small annoying voice echoing in black tunnels,calling "Frodo, Frodo! Gimme that biscuit!" But instead of Frodohundreds of hideous, nasty, mean and vicious goblin-faces grinned athim out of the shadows, displaying bridgework that made him cringe.Where was Morrie (and his dentist's drill) when you needed him?   He woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Eveningwas coming and the sky was growing dim. He turned and found that thedream was little worse than the waking, except that he had shut up. Hiswrists, legs and ankles were tied with string. Beside him Morrie lay,asleep, with a knotted handkerchief over his face to keep the fliesoff. All about them sat or stood a great company of goblins.   Slowly in Pipsqueak's aching head memory pieced itself together andbecame separated from dream-shadow. Of course: he and Morrie had runoff into the woods leaving Boromir to the goblins; they had run a long way screaming  he could not remember how far or how long, his mindhaving blanked out that rather embarrassing detail; and then suddenlythey had crashed into the same group of goblins, having described aperfect circle: they were standing listening to Boromir play his horn,several beating a syncopated rhythm on nearby trees and swayingappreciatively to the mellow tones. The goblins did not appear to seehim or Morrie until they had drawn their swords and given five of themBywater smiles*. Then they yelled and dozens of other goblins hadsprung out of the trees (literally), but they did not wish to fight,and only tried to stop the hobbits from killing any more by grabbinghold of them, even when Morrie drew a miniature repeating crossbow fromhis waistcoat and started shooting them in certain parts. Good oldMorrie!   Then Boromir finished the jazz number and started playing one ofSchoenberg's lesser-known works: this slew many of them and the restfled. But they had not gone very far on the way back when they wereattacked again, by a hundred music critics at least, some of them veryscathing, and they hurled an acid rain of sarcastic reviews: always atBoromir. Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and atfirst the critics had been deafened and had drawn back; but when noanswer but the echoes came, they knew they had no full orchestra tocontend with and attacked more fiercely than ever. Pipsqueak did notremember much more. His last memory was of Boromir leaning against atree, muttering something about them all regretting it when his debutalbum was released; then darkness fell suddenly.   "I suppose I was knocked on the head," he said to himself. "KnowingMorrie, I doubt he got hurt. What has happened to Boromir? Why didn't the goblins try to kill us? Why am I here? What is 2+2?"   He could not answer the questions. He felt cold, sick, stupid andhungry. "I wish Gandalf had never persuaded El Rond to let us come," hethought. "What good have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, amessenger, a mariner that should have tarried in Arvernien, a piece ofluggage. And now I have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggagefor the goblins. I wonder if I'm insured? I hope Strider or someonewill come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't he just cashin on the policy and forget about us? I wish I could think of a lessdepressing metaphor!"   He struggled a little, quite uselessly. Whoever had tied this stringwas an expert with ligatures (which made him think of Sam and hisfamily's skill with rope, something that had proved especially usefulto the Bywater lynch mob when they strung up three Shiriffs who were inthe pay of the Grumbleguts family), and also knew that he was about asstrong as Bree-land lager. One of the goblins sitting near laughed andsaid something to Morrie in an abominable accent with ridiculous-sounding vowels; Morrie chuckled sleepily. "Rest while you can, youfrightful little oik," he said then to Pipsqueak in the Common Speech,which he still managed to to make almost as bizarre as his ownlanguage. "Rest while you can! We'll find a use for your feeble littlelegs before long. You'll wish you had none before we get back to Tower.Not used to a brisk cross-country run, I expect."   "If I had my way, you'd wish you were expelled now," said theother. "I'd make you squeak, you pathetic squib." He stooped overPipsqueak, bringing his yellow, uneven fangs close to his face. He worea purple tie with a crest on it, and had a cane with a long, whiplikeswitch in his hand. "Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this," hehissed. "Don't draw attention to yourself and disturb your betters, orI may forget my orders. Curse the Guards! Cedríc in glasshouse thebootless Aruman-tick handman blood..." he passed into a long angry speechin his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.   Terrified Pipsqueak lay still, though the pain in his head and bladderwas growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. Totake his mind off himself he listened intently to all he could hear.There were many voices round about, and though goblin-speech sounded atall times full of hate and argot, it seemed plain that something like aquarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.   To Pipsqueak's surprise he found that much of the talk wasintelligible; many of the goblins were using ordinary language.Apparently the members of two or three quite different schools werepresent, and they could not understand one another's clique-speech.There was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: whichway they were to take and what should be done with the "new boy".   "There's no time to initiate him properly," said one. "No time fortradition on this trip."   "That can't be helped," said another. "But why not enrol him quick,enrol him now? We're in a hurry. Evening's coming, and we ought to geta move on if we don't want to lose house points and face the Run."   "Orders," said a third voice in a deep growl. "Kill all but not theHalflings; they are to brought back uninitiated as quickly as possiblefor extra credit. That's my orders."   "What are they wanted for?" asked several voices. "Why uninitiated?Are they good at sport?"   "Not likely: they look about as promising as Johnson minor. I heardthat one of them has got something, something that's wanted for theSeason, some elvish plot or other. Anyway, they'll both be interviewed."   "Is that all you know? Why don't we search them and find out? We might find something that we could use ourselves: some drinks, or someweed, or something like that."   "That is a very interesting remark," sneered a voice, softer than the others but more evil. "I may have to report that. The new pupilsare not to be searched or molested: those are my orders."   "And mine too," said the deep voice. "Alive and as recruited. That'smy orders."   "Not our orders!" said one of the earlier voices. "We have come allthe way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our shocking loss on points.I wish to kill, then go up north."   "Then you can wish again," said the growling voice. "I am Cedríc. Iam the senior prefect. I return to Guard School by the shortest road."   "Is Aruman the headmaster or the Great Eye?" said the evil voice."We should go back at once to Tower."   "If we could cross the Great River, we might," said another voice."But there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges, and thesenew boys won't have got their Swimming colours yet."   "I came across," said the evil voice. "A winged Nazdaq awaits usnorthward at the East Bank; he's just calling in a few of Pater'sdebts."   "Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with the new pupils, and get allthe kudos and house points for Tower, and leave us to hike as best as wecan through the golf-country. No, we must stick together. These landsare dangerous: full of foul parvenus and new money with no form."   "Yah, we must stick together," growled Cedríc. "I don't trust youlittle Mines House swine. You've no standards outside your own sties.But for us you'd all have run away. We are the Uruk-Hai prefects! Wedestroyed the confidence of the great musician. We recruited the newboys. We are the pupils of Aruman the Wise, the White Hand Gang. Wecame out of Guard House and led you here, and we shall lead you back bythe way we choose. I am Cedríc. I have spoken."   "You have spoken more than enough, Cedríc," sneered the evil voice."I wonder how the masters would like it in Tower. They might think thatCedríc's neck needed relieving of a prefect tie. They might ask wherehis strange ideas come from. Did they come from Aruman, perhaps? Whodoes he think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white Housebadges? They might agree with me, with Clarénce their trusted bridgeclub secretary; and I Clarénce say this: Aruman is a fool, and a dirtytreacherous fool. But the Head has his Eye on him.   "Swine, is it? How do you boys like being called swine by the muck-rakers of a dirty little Chem master?"   Many loud yells in goblin-argot answered him, and the whisperingswish of canes being brandished. Cautiously Pipsqueak rolled over,hoping to see what would happen. His guards had gone to join in the fray.In the twilight he saw a large goblin, probably Cedríc, standing facingClarénce, a short crook-legged creature with no chin. Round them weremany smaller goblins. Pipsqueak supposed that these were the ones fromthe North. They had drawn their canes and wet towels, but hesitated toattack Cedríc.   Cedríc shouted, and a number of goblins of nearly his own size ran up.Then suddenly, without warning, Cedríc sprang forwards, and with twoswift strokes caned the hands of two of his opponents. Clarénce steppedaside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way.   "Boys, put those canes away or I'll thrash you," snarled Cedríc. "Andlet's have no more nonsense! We go straight west from here, and downthe stair. From there to the downs, then along the river to the forest,then three laps around the playing field. Along the Cadet TrainingCourse and back to Guard House in time for prep. That clear?"   The goblins were getting ready to begin the cross-country run again, but some of the Northerners were still unwilling, and the Guardsprefects caned two more before the rest were cowed. There was muchconfusion. For the moment Pipsqueak was unwatched. His legs weresecurely bound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and hislegs were in front of him. He could move them both together, though thebonds were cruelly tight. He tried gnawing through the string, thenremembered the knife that Morrie had convinced him to wear up hissleeve "just in case". He waved his arms in what he hoped was aninconspicuous, I've-got-cramp sort of way until the tiny blade workedloose from its sheath: the edge snicked his arm, and then slid down hiswrist. Pipsqueak whimpered: he hated the sight of blood, particularlyhis own, but steeling himself he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up anddown against the blade of the knife. The string was cut! QuicklyPipsqueak took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loosebracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. Then he lay verystill.   "Pick up those new boys!" shouted Cedríc. "Don't play any tricks withthem! If they are not in alive when we get back, it'll be detentionsand the glasshouse all round till someone owns up. Remember the goodname of your House and school."   A goblin seized Pipsqueak like a sack, tied a horrid brown tie roundhis neck, grabbed his arms and forced him into a disgusting greenblazer with gold piping; then it gave him a good kick "for your owngood, you detestable midget" and picked him up by the ears while othersswished canes meaningfully. Morrie yawned, got up and put on theuniform with every appearance of enthusiasm; the goblins were almostdeferential to him. Pipsqueak looked at Morrie in horror, as hesuddenly realised who must have hit him over the head, and tied thoseknowingly mocking knots. Morrie glanced at him, and smirked. Pipsqueakshut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams. Most of them involvedMorrie and sharp implements.   Suddenly he was thrown onto the stony floor again. It was early night,but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edgeof a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was asound of water falling nearby.   "The scouts have come back at last," said a goblin close out hand.   "What a relief," hissed another, and the sound of water ceased.   "Well, what did you discover?" growled the voice of Cedríc.   "We had to destroy a couple of villages to get them, sir, but we'vegot enough feather beds for the senior prefects, and breakfast for theentire cross-country party. All's well now."   "Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have kept a few of the yokels alive to carry the beds for us. Now we'll just have toleave them here. Damn you all to hell!"   "Yes, sir," said the scout.   A shadow bent over Pipsqueak. It belonged to Cedríc. "Sit up!" saidthe prefect. "My bloods are tired of lugging you about. We have got toclimb down, and you must use your legs. Be a man now. No crying, noslacking, follow the principles that have made Guard House old boysgreat. Let's see if you make the grade in one of our smaller tests,shall we?"   He cut the string round Pipsqueak's legs and ankles, picked him up by his ears and stood him on his feet. Pipsqueak fell down, and Cedrícdragged him up by his ears again. Morrie laughed. Cedríc thrust a flaskbetween his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat, whilethe goblins chanted, "Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!" Pipsqueak managed todrain the whole bottle, and the goblins cheered. Cedríc lookedimpressed. Pipsqueak felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. The painin his legs and ankles vanished. He could stand, although walking in astraight line proved surprisingly difficult.   "Where's mine?" Morrie demanded. Cedríc glowered and looked about todraw his cane, then thought better of it and signalled for anotherflask. Morrie looked him in the eye, then unstoppered it and positivelyguzzled the contents. The goblins were flabbergasted. "These Halflingsare damned good drinkers, I'll say that for them," one of themmuttered, sipping gingerly at an alcopop.   Morrie stood up, looking calm and relaxed, as though being proffereddrinks by goblins was nothing out of the ordinary. "Where do we get bedand breakfast?" he demanded.   "Do I look like a scout?" Cedríc snapped. "Ask them, it's none of mybusiness."   "Suit yourself," Morrie said languidly. "But I don't expect my fatherwill be very pleased once he hears that I haven't been treated well.Why, he may even choose to withdraw his generous donation to the GuardHouse trust fund"   Pipsqueak could hardly believe his ears (which were now throbbing andapproximately three times as big as they had been at the start ofthe "cross-country run"). Morrie's father was notoriously tight-fisted(he was known as Sorrowduck Snatchgold, or "Sorrie" for short) and inaddition had not been seen by anyone outside his family for threeyears: Gaffer Gamgee had voiced a commonly-held opinion that "youngmaster Morrie" had been rather previous in assuming control of thehousehold, resigning himself to the notion with the phlegmaticobservation that "it won't matter one whit when the Revolution comes,you mark my words". Yet here was Morrie using his father's allegedmunificence as a bargaining tool with the creatures of the Enemy, andgetting away with it! He watched Cedríc back down with a mutteredapology and a summons to the nearest scout to give "Mister Brandybuck"all the information he wanted. The scout promised obsequiouslythat "you'll get bed and breakfast all right, sir, more than you canmanage."   "I doubt that," Pipsqueak said out loud, and was caned for speakingout of turn.   The party began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the mistyplain below. Morrie and Pipsqueak, separated by a dozen or more smallergoblins who were busily toadying up to the new boy who could cheekCedríc the Guard blood and get away with it, climbed down with them. Atthe bottom they stepped onto grass, and Pipsqueak's heart rose; hecould feel the fine-trimmed green of a golf course of Rohan under hisfeet, and he remembered the old story about Bandyknees the Bullshitterand King Golfball the goblin, drawing confidence from the connexionwith the hobbit who walked off with the first Masters trophy with astaggering 61. He then remembered that the Bullshitter had been lynchedby a distinctly biased crowd, and that Golfball had given his name tothe sport for a very good reason, and suddenly felt a lot colder.   "Now straight on!" shouted Cedríc. "West and a little north. FollowEustáce. Let's trample their precious golf courses a little, that'll bea good prank, eh boys?"   "But what are we going to do at sunrise?" some of the northernersasked.   "We shall sing the school song, give three cheers for the Headmasterand Aruman his Deputy, and cane Plowman Minimus for picking his noseand eating it when he thought no-one was looking," Cedríc repliedpromptly; Pipsqueak could see how he had ended up as seniorprefect. "Then go on running. What do you think? Sit on the green andwait for the nouveaux riches to tee off?"   "But we can't run in the sunlight; we have allergies, and sick-notesfrom our parents."   "You'll run with me behind you, you loathsome slugs," saidCedríc. "Allergies? You pathetic frogspawn make me sick, with yourexcuses and your weak chests and your heart conditions. No wonder GuardHouse has thrashed you in every game of rugger for the last eighteenseasons. You're not fit to wear those ties, you hear me? Now get out ofmy sight. Allergies, my foot!" He raised the aforementioned extremityand booted the nearest northerner into a bunker. It was then thatPipsqueak noticed that, like hobbits, the Guards pupils wore no shoes,and that their feet extruded little studs, and were toeless, beingfitted with steel toecaps instead.   Then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides ofgoblins. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling and cursing; severalgoblins got studded in the confusion, and elbows were used withoutmercy. This was clearly an important run, as the prefects from eachhouse went up and down the line, beating those among their fellows whocould not match the pace. Pipsqueak, who was far back in the linehiding among a group of no-hopers and hoping that Cedríc would not spothim, gathered that an important trophy was at stake. He could not seeMorrie. He wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace; hehad had no food since the morning. But at present the goblin-liquor("ghash-water" as they called it) was still hot in him.   Every now and again there came into his mind an unbidden vision of thefat face of Strider bending myopically over a dark trail, and waddling,waddling behind. More vivid, however, was the image of the giganticfive-headed hamster waving a sickle and singing "My Balrog lies overthe ocean" out of tune, and he began to sweat profusely and shiver atthe thought of its evil little eyes and its malicious whiskers.   They had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the course slopeddown into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet:the goblins busied themselves knocking down the boundary fence. Thedark shapes of the goblins in front grew dim, and several wereswallowed up.   "Damn it all! Quicksand!" shouted Cedríc from the rear.   Pipsqueak could stand it no more. If the quicksand did not swallowhim up, the mutant hamster certainly would. He swerved aside to theright, and fell headfirst into the mist. "Come back here, you snivellinglittle toerag!" Cedríc roared.   Pipsqueak sprang up and ran screaming, divesting himself of hisclothes as he ran.   "This'll shake that monster off the scent a little!" he reasoned. Hetore off his tie and blazer, then threw away his waistcoat and undidhis silver belt, which began to deliver a tinny rendition of "Happybirthday to you" in Elvish. He moved to take off his trousers, but longarms and hard claws seized him and he came to his senses.   Strangely the goblins refrained from punishing him, and he foundhimself regarded with a degree of awe by the northerners; even theGuards left him alone.   "I don't know why I did it," he whispered to Morrie, who was nowjogging next to him. "It seemed to make sense at the time."   "You've got guts, I'll say that for you," Morrie replied. "Eitherthat or you're even dafter than I thought. Haven't you heard anythingabout public schoolboys? Still, I imagine they'll leave you alone fornow. I may make a Took of you yet, cousin!"   "What do you mean?" Pipsqueak demanded. Morrie smiled, but saidnothing.   Neither Pipsqueak nor Morrie remembered much of the latter part ofthe journey, since they were treated to copious quantities of Ghash-waterby their fellow runners. They veered, and zigzagged, and fell over, butif they halted or stumbled they were picked up and carried by thenortherners, who had unofficially adopted them. The Guards prefectsscowled, but said nothing. There was still no sign of Clarénce.   The warmth of the latest flask had gone, and Pipsqueak was sick again.Suddenly he fell face downwards on the turf. An hour and a half later,the company noticed he was missing and sent a party back to retrievehim. Whatever kudos his panicked streaking had won him evaporated; hewas carried in a sack and darkness was about him.   "I'm suffocating in here!" he yelled, but to no avail.   Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: many of the more unfitgoblins were demanding a rest. Cedríc was shouting. He felt himselfflung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, until black dreams tookhim. At three in the morning the company was woken by cries of "Clownsare climbing through the window!" and an irate prefect kicked the sackuntil Pipsqueak was silent once more.   Slowly he came back to the waking world with a bleeding nose andbruised ribs. Orders were shouted (he heard Morrie bellow "Ten baconsandwiches!") and he was tipped out and thrown roughly on the grass.There he lay for a while, fighting with nausea. His head swam, but fromthe heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught.His vision blurred. A scout stooped over him and flung him some breadwith a strange, oddly-coloured circle of meat in the middle. He ate thesesame seed bun hungrily, but not the meat: he was famished, but notyet so famished as to eat a hamburger, the flesh of he dared not guesswhat creature.   He sat up and looked about. Morrie was not far away. They were by thebanks of a swift narrow river. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak wascatching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on thelower slopes before them. There was no sign of any giant hamsters.   There was much shouting and debating among the goblins; a quarrelseemed on the point of breaking out again between the northerners andthe Guards. Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointingeastwards. One was pointing up in the air, but he was caned anddesisted.   "Very well," said Cedríc. "Leave them to me then! If you want tothrow away what we've come all the way to get, throw it away! I'll lookafter it. Let the Uruk-Hai look after it, as usual. If you're afraid ofthe Whiteballs, run! Run! There's the forest," he shouted, pointingahead. "Get to it! It's your best hope: it's out of bounds. Off you go!And quick, before I knock a few more teeth in, to put some sense intothe others." No-one appeared to understand the last part, but they saidnothing.   There was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the northernersbroke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly alongthe river towards the mountains and showing more athletic prowess thanthey had demonstrated in the entire journey up to that point. Thehobbits were left with the Guard House contingent: a grim dark band,four score at least of large, muscular, bone-headed jocks with greatcanes and short tempers. A few of the larger and bolder northernersremained with them.   "Now we'll deal with that little rat Clarénce," said Cedríc; but someeven of his fellow Guards were looking uneasily southwards.   "I know," growled Cedríc. "The cursed polo-players have got wind ofus. But that's all your fault, Jeffries. You and the other scouts oughtto have your wages docked. But we are the prefects. We'll feast onhorseflesh yet, or something better. Filet mignon would suit me, but Isuppose we'll have to see what's on High Table."   At that moment Pipsqueak saw why some of the troop had been pointingeastward. From that direction there now came hoarse cries, and therewas Clarénce again, and at his back a couple of score of others likehim: long-limbed chinless goblins. They had a red eye on their prefectbadges. Cedríc stepped forward to meet them.   "So you've come back?" he said. "Thought better of it, eh?"   "I've returned to see that Orders are carried out and the new boyssafe," answered Clarénce.   "Indeed!" said Cedríc. "Waste of effort. I'll see that orders arecarried out in my prefecture. And what else did you come back for? Youwent in a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?"   "I left a fool," snarled Clarénce. "But there were some stout fellowswith him who were too good to lose, especially if that cricket rematchagainst Gundabad hasn't been cancelled. I knew you'd lead them into amess. I've come to help them."   "Splendid!" laughed Cedríc. "But unless you've some guts for a scrapwith the hoi polloi you've taken the wrong way. Tower was your road.The Whiteballs are coming. What's happened to your precious Nazdaq? Hashe had another mount impounded by the police for speeding? Now, ifyou'd brought him along, that might have been useful  if these Nazdaqare all they make out."   "Nazdaq, Nazdaq," said Clarénce, shivering and licking his chops, asif the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. "You speak ofwhat is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, Cedríc," hesaid. "Nazdaq! Ah! All that they make out! One day you'll wish that youhad not said that. Ape!" he snarled fiercely. "You ought to know thatthey're the apple of the Great Eye, you numbskull, but you clearlyhaven't done your Evil Economic Forces prep yet. But the winged Nazdaq:not yet, not yet. He won't let them show themselves across the GreatRiver yet, not before they've got their pilot's licences. They're forthe Season  and other purposes, such as sky-writing."   "You seem to know a lot," said Cedríc. "More than is good for you, Iguess. Perhaps those in Tower might wonder how, and why, not to mentionwho, when, where and what. But in the meantime the Uruk-Hai of GuardHouse can do the dirty work, as usual. Don't stand slavering there! Forheaven's sake get a handkerchief or something. You make me feel quitefaint. The other swine are legging it to the forest, and you'd betterfollow. You wouldn't get back to the Great River alive. Right off themark! Now! I'll be on your heels, and that," he stamped on a smallrock, which shattered completely, "will hurt."   The Guards seized Pipsqueak and Morrie, much to the indignation of thelatter, who shouted something about his father. Then the troop startedoff. Hour after hour they ran, slinging the hobbits from one carrier toanother, while others tried to tackle them. "No point wasting time thatcan be used for rugger practice," Cedríc boomed. The Guards graduallypassed through the Tower party, and soon they were gaining on thenortherners as well. The forest began to draw nearer.   Pipsqueak was bruised, torn, hung over and miserable. "Is this what allpublic schools are like?" he thought to himself. His father had put hisname down for Dunharrow-on-the-Hill, but Pipsqueak had run away when hefound out. Morrie, of course, had been to Wood Eaton; Pipsqueaksupposed that he had learned his unquenchable self-confidence andbrutal habits there. Much good was it doing him now, though, beingthrown from one set of iron hands to another. This brought Pipsqueaksome consolation, until a penalty was declared and he was kicked fiftyyards through the air and bounced a further fifteen.   In the afternoon Cedríc's troop overtook the northerners. They weresneezing in the rays of the bright sun; their heads were down and theirtongues were lolling out. One of them was searching for his antihistaminespray.   "Maggots!" jeered the Guards. "You're cooked. The Whiteballs willcatch you and kill you. They're coming!"   A cry from Clarénce showed that this was not mere jest. Horsemen,riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind butgaining on the goblins. They were waving polo mallets in the air.   The Guards began to run with a redoubled pace that astonishedPipsqueak, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then hesaw that the sun was sinking; shadows reached over the land. The Towercontingent lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. Theforest was dark and close. The land was beginning to slope upwards, butthe goblins did not halt. Both Cedríc and Clarénce shouted, spurringthem on to a last effort.   "They will make it yet. They will escape," thought Pipsqueak intypically optimistic mood. Then his latest carrier managed to twist hisneck, so that he ended up (in severe pain) glancing back over hisshoulder. He saw that the riders away eastward were already level withthe goblins, galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their ridinghelmets and mallets. They were hemming the goblins in, preventing themfrom scattering, and driving them along the line of the river.He wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished now thathe had learned more at Rivendell, or indeed anywhere at all, and lookedmore at maps and books and things; but in those days the plans for thejourney seemed to be in more competent hands, namely those of everyoneelse, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, orfrom Strider, or Frodo, or Boromir, or... All that he could rememberabout Rohan was that it was called Rohan. All things considered, thatwas not very much help. But better than nothing, as far as it went.   "But how will they know that we are not goblins?" he thought, lookingat Morrie's wicked and sly face, and the uniform that they had oncemore forced him to wear. "I don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbitsdown here, and if they have they probably want to kill us anywaybecause of our criminal network. I suppose I should be glad that thebeastly goblins look like being destroyed, but that isn't really muchconsolation is it?"   A few of the riders appeared to be golfers, judging from the squiresriding beside them bearing club-filled bags. Riding swiftly into rangeand then dismounting, they hit volleys of white balls (Pipsqueak wasstrangely relieved when he made the connexion) and the goblins thatstraggled behind, coughing and wheezing. Several of them fell, althoughgiven their level of fitness they were probably having heart attacks;then the riders wheeled out of range of the answering ink-pellets andpaper aeroplanes of their enemies, who aimed wildly, not daring tohalt. This happened many times, and on one occasion balls fell amongthe Guards. One of them, just in front of Pipsqueak, got hit in thetemple and did not get up again.   Night came down without the riders closing in for battle. Manygoblins had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. In the early darknessthe goblins came to a hillock, but did not know whether to eat it or talkto it, and so left it alone. The eaves of the forest were very near,probably no more than three furlongs away, but Pipsqueak didn't knowhow long a furlong was, so that wasn't very helpful. The horsemen hadencircled them. A small band disobeyed Cedríc's command, and beganplaying a vigorous march, until they were caned into submission.   "Well, here we are," sneered Clarénce. "Fine leadership! I hope thegreat Cedríc will lead us out again."   "Put those halflings down!" ordered Cedríc, taking no notice ofClarénce. "You, Eustáce, get two others and stand guard over them!They're not to be killed unless the filthy Whiteballs break through.Understand? As long as I'm alive, I want 'em. But they're not to cryout, and they're not to be rescued. We were entrusted to being the newboys back to Guard House, and that's what we're going to do, whetherthey like it or not. Bind their legs!"   The last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. But Pipsqueakfound that for the first time he was close to Morrie. The goblins weremaking a great deal of noise, shouting and swishing their canes, andthe hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.   "Get your hands off my neck!" Morrie croaked. "I'll have you dumpedin the swamp with concrete shoes."   "Hobbits don't wear shoes!" Pipsqueak replied instinctively.   "A concrete waistcoat, then. Leave off!"   Pipsqueak let go. Morrie coughed for a while, then hissed: "What didyou expect? Look out for number one is my motto. They said they werethere to recruit us into their school, and they seemed to think thattying you up was an appropriate initiation ritual. That's publicschoolboys for you. Anyway, I need to get to Isengard quickly, and thisseemed like a good idea."   "Isengard? Are you mad?"   "On the contrary, Isengard is the only reason I joined this stupidexpedition in the first place. Do I look like the altruistic type? Dome a favour. Remember when my cousins Norbert and Clovis were found inthe Woody End riddled with holes? That was Sackville-Baggins work.Young Lotho is getting some new kind of weapon shipped in from Isengardin return for some high-quality weed, and I need to close it downbefore we lose our investments in the Southfarthing completely."   "You are mad. You've travelled halfway across the continent, just toshut down a weapons smuggling operation? Well anyway, that's all verywell, but why am I here?"   Just then, however, a savage kick warned Pipsqueak that the noise haddied down, and the Guards were watchful.   The night was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the goblinswere gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness,a complete ring of them.   "There is nothing between me and the wheel of fire," Pipsqueak thought.They were within a long bowshot, but the goblins had no longbows. Theriders made no sound. Later in the night when the moon came out of themist, then they could occasionally be seen.   "They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!" growled one of the Guards."Why don't we get together and charge through? What's old Cedríc thinkhe's doing, I should like to know?"   "I daresay you would," snarled Cedríc stepping up from behind."Meaning I don't think at all, eh? That's five hours' detention for you,Harrison. You're just as bad as the other rabble: the maggots and theapes of Tower. No good trying to charge with them: they'd just squealand bolt, and there are more than enough of these filthy middle-classfools to mop up our lot on the flat. Still, there's one thing thesefine fellows don't know: Mauríce and his lads are in the forest, andthey should turn up any time now."   Cedríc's words were apparently enough to satisfy the Guards; but theother goblins were both dispirited and rebellious. They posted a fewwatchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasantdarkness. It did indeed become very dark: the fires brought no light tothe hillock, whatever it was. The riders were not, however, contentmerely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcryon the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. Itseemed that some of the men had riden in close, slipped off theirhorses, crawled to the edge of the camp and beaten several goblins todeath with their one-irons before fading away again. Cedríc dashed offto stop a stampede.   Pipsqueak and Morrie sat up. The Guards had gone with Cedríc. But ifthe hobbits had any thought of escape it was soon dashed. A long hairyarm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together, Dimlythey were aware of Clarénce's great head and hideous lack of chinbetween them. He began to paw them and feel them. Pipsqueak shudderedas hard cold fingers groped down his front.   "Well, my little ones!" said Clarénce in a soft whisper. "Enjoyingyour nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps; canes andtowels on one side, and nasty mallets on the other! Little people shouldnot meddle in affairs that are too big for them." His fingers continued togrope. There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.   The thought came suddenly into Pipsqueak's mind, as if caught directfrom the urgent thought of the enemy: "Clarénce knows about the Ring!He's looking for it, while Cedríc is busy: he probably wants it forhimself. Good heavens, I hope that's what he's after." Cold fear was inPipsqueak's heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use hecould make of Clarénce's desire.   "I don't think you will find it that way," he whispered. "It isn'teasy to find."   "Find it?" said Clarénce: his fingers stopped crawling, much toPipsqueak's relief, and gripped his shoulder. "Find what? What are youtalking about, little one?"   "For a moment Pipsqueak was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness hemade a noise in his throat: saddam, saddam. "Nothing, my precious," headded, for good measure.   The hobbits felt Clarénce's fingers twitch. "O ho!" hissed the goblinsoftly. "So that's what he means, is it? Very ve-ry dangerous, mylittle ones."   "Perhaps," said Morrie, now alert and aware of Pipsqueak's guess."Perhaps, and not only for us. Still you know your own business best.Do you want it, or not? And what you give for it?"   "Do I want it? Do I want it?" said Clarénce as if puzzled; but hisarms were trembling. "What would I give for it? What do you mean?"   "We mean," said Pipsqueak, choosing his words carefully, "that it'sno good groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But youmust untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing and tell all."   "My dear tender little fools," hissed Clarénce, "everything you have,and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time:everything! You'll wish there was more you could do to satisfy theQuestioner, indeed you will: quite soon. We shan't hurry theexperience. Oh dear no! What do you think you've been kept alive for?My dear little fellows, please believe me when I say that it was notout of kindness; that's not even one of Cedríc's faults."   "I find it quite easy to believe," said Morrie. "But you haven't gotyour prey home yet. And it doesn't seem to be going your way, whateverhappens. If we come to Guard House, it won't be Clarénce that benefits:Aruman will take all the pupils he can find if it'll help him pay therent. If you want anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal."   Clarénce began to lose his temper. The name of Aruman seemedspecially to enrage him. Time was passing and the disturbance was dyingdown. Cedríc or the Guards might return at any minute. "Have you gotit - either of you?" he snarled.   "Saddam, saddam!" said Pipsqueak.   "Untie our legs!" said Morrie.   They felt the goblin's arms trembling wildly. "Curse you, you filthylittle vermin!" he hissed. "Untie your legs? I'll untie every string inyour bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the bones? Search you!I'll cut you both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help of yourlegs to get you away  and have you all to myself!"   "Wait!" shouted Pipsqueak. "Don't you want our help in finding theRing?"   "Ring?? What on earth are you talking about, you pathetic shrimp?"Clarénce snapped.   Pipsqueak was suddenly much, much more afraid.   Suddenly he seized them. He tucked them one under each armpit andcrushed them fiercely to his sides. Then he sprang forward, stoopinglow. Quickly and silently he went, till he came to the edge of theknoll. There, choosing a gap between the watchers, he passed like anevil shadow out into the night, down the slope and away westwardtowards the river that flowed out of the forest. In that directionthere was a wide open space with only one fire.   After going a dozen yards he halted, peering and listening. Nothingcould be seen or heard. He crept slowly on. Then he stood up, as if torisk a sudden dash. At that very moment the dark form of a rider loomedup in front of him. "Nazdaq!" he shouted in surprise and alarm. It washis undoing. A polo mallet whistled through the air and dealt him asharp crack on the skull. He gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still.The hobbits remained flat on the ground, too afraid to move.   At last Morrie stirred and whispered softly: "I don't even want toknow what he was up to, but now we've got some sort of chance! But howare we to avoid being walloped?"   The answer came almost immediately. From the yells and screeches thatwere coming from the knoll they guessed that their disappearance hadbeen discovered. Then suddenly the answering cries of goblin-voicescame from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires. Mauríce hadapparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers with heavy-dutyriding crops and several cats o' nine tails. The riders were drawing intheir ring close round the knoll so as to prevent any sortie, while acompany rode off to deal with the newcomers. Suddenly Morrie andPipsqueak realised that without moving they were now outside thecircle: there was nothing between them and escape.   "Now," said Morrie, "if only we had our legs and hands free, we might get away."   "I was going to tell you: I've managed to free my hands. These loopsare only left for show." Pipsqueak tugged at the string, only to findthat he had just unwittingly made the knot fast. Morrie said a word,then pulled a stiletto from his heel ("Don't ask," he warned hisastonished cousin) and cut the bonds.   The hobbits then sat and ate two or three Twinkies, until Morrierealised how stupid that was and gestured for Pipsqueak to get a moveon.   They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, but it was a longslow business. They reached the edge if the river, then looked back.The sounds had died away. Evidently Mauríce and his lads had beenkilled or driven off. Already the night was old. In the east the skywas beginning to grow pale.   "We must get under cover," said Pipsqueak, "or we shall be seen. It won't be any comfort to us if the riders only find out we aren'tgoblins when we're dead. I could stagger on now. What about you,Morrie?"   Morrie got up. "Yes," he said. "I can manage it. Twinkies do putheart into you; it must be all the life-enhancing E-numbers andpreservatives. Damn, I have such a hangover. I need a drink."   They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of theriver. "You seem to have been doing well for yourself, Master Took,"said Morrie. "You aren't a total moron after all! Your father will bepleased."   Pipsqueak looked puzzled.   "Do you not yet understand, Paragraph Took? Your father paid me ahandsome sum to train you up to become a decent criminal mastermindlike the rest of your family. I thought he was throwing his money away,but it looks as though you may shape up yet.   "But Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now, because for all thatyou still have absolutely no idea where we are, do you? That's what youget for not getting a decent education. We are walking along the Entwash;in front of us is Fangorn Forest."   "Lead on, Moribund!" said Pipsqueak. "If you have any idea where you'regoing, which I doubt."   "I am going to Isengard, as I told you," Morrie snapped. "Now shut upif you don't want a dagger in your guts. We can take a short-cut throughthe forest. Just don't do anything stupid."   "I won't," said Pipsqueak, lighting a cigarette and throwing the litmatch away.   The two of them made their way into the forest under the huge branches.They looked back across the river, and with the dawn the riders charged,waving their mallets, and launching a rain of golf-balls.   "That's what you get if you trample on the pride and golf courses ofthe aspiring middle class," Morrie observed. "The highest echelon ofgoblin society has had it: Sam would be ecstatic." He shuddered, andturned away.   So it was that they did not see the last stand, when Cedríc wasovertaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he wasslain at last by Eowynn, who dismounted and beat him repeatedly in thehead with a sand wedge.   Then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound, the ridersmade a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies. So endedthe longest cross-country run in the history of public schooling, andno news of it came ever back either to Tower or to Guard House.   "Hey, look at this!" Morrie shouted. He pointed at a goblin thatlooked as though it had been trampled to death by a pair of very largeand very heavy feet. Next to it was a violin-case. Morrie picked it up.   "It suits you," remarked Pipsqueak, not knowing what else to say.   Morrie grinned. He stood silent for a moment, then observed, "Didn'tthose goblins seem a bit stiff, or scratchy, to you?"   "I don't know any more than you do about that," said Pipsqueakinnocently. "After all, you were the one who went to a public school."   "What are you implying?" Morrie demanded querulously.   They disappeared into the forest.     * The Bywater Smile - Shire slang for an expertly slit throat, not        to be confused with the Tuckborough grin, which under optimum       conditions required a corkscrew, an ell of twine and three enraged pigs,       or the Scary grimace, which was a particularly unnerving expression. In       the past Morrie had crafted some great smiles. These were not up to his       usual standard, but still effective.
   Along the stream the hobbits walked, west and up towards theslopes, deeper and deeper into Fungang. As their fear of the Orcsdwindled they started paying attention to their surroundings, andsuddenly, simultaneously, they discovered something truly remarkable:many of the "trees" were lamp-posts!  There they stood, scatteredamong the trees as though they be planted there as naturally as anybeech or birch!  Some of them were lit with a flicker of gas-flame ora cobweb-covered lightbulb. The hobbits were positively flummoxed.   As the initial surprise subsided, the ever practical Morrie startedlaying plans for an import business of streetlamps into the Shire. Hementioned this to Pipsqueak.   "Won't be profitable in itself, I think," replied Pipsqueak. "Toomany places where they like the dark, except for the occasionalbonfire. But as a cover for our more rewarding businesses it'd beperfect."  Morrie's regard for Pipsqueak went up considerably at thisdisplay of first-rate criminal thinking. From about 1½ to 2 on ascale from 0 to 100 ---   "Let's have a toast to that," said Morrie. "I need a drinkanyroad."  Sweet Eru I need a drink. Head still throbbing, heclambered onto a tree-root that wound into the stream and, pretendingto drink from the swirling water, had a swig, and another swig, from abottle that he had swiped from the dying body of Clárence. He did notsuspect that an equally-unsuspecting Pipsqueak did precisely the sameon another tree-root.   Returning to firm ground, a little unsteadily (Clárence had been abig drinker), they at once fell to the topic of food. "Well, wehave our Twinkies," said Morrie. They looked at their dwindlingsupplies. About fifty packages, between them. "Won't last tilltomorrow noon," commented Pipsqueak.   Just then they became aware of an orange light that had appearedfurther into the wood, north and a little west. "Lookit that," saidMorrie. "Could it be a fast food joint turning on their advertisingbillboard or something?"   They began to walk towards the orange light. A few steps into thewood Pipsqueak suddenly stopped. Then he laughed. There lay a hugesuit of armour, leaning against a tree. The tie still bound aroundits neck, mousy brown on closer inspection, proved it to have belongedto an orc. Pipsqueak put the armour on, or rather, climbed into it.Being slim and trim for a hobbit, he managed to squeeze his waist downthrough the yawning neck-hole. He laughed again, his head sticking uplike an apple showing over the rim of a barrel. Morrie smiledcondescendingly.   "What's that pin on the tie?" he asked. "Looks like a small whitehand-shaped badge or something. This belong to one of Cedríc's boys?Get out of that ironmongery, we've no time to play house now!"Pipsqueak sighed and tipped the top of the armour off with a heave anda clatter, and they went on.   After a short hike through this strange forest of metal and wood,they came to a small cliff. Up it went a flight of broad, well-laidstairs, though cracked now with age and partly covered by lichen. Atthe top of the stairs there was just a platform with a brown ironfence and a rock wall, and an especially large lamp-post. It shonewith a glaring sodium light, bright even under the morning sun. Thehobbits, broad culinary tastes though they have, felt hungrier thanever: they could not eat a lamp-post of iron and glass. Not eventhey. They started climbing the stairs for a look-around.   Standing beneath the lamp-post, and somehow not daring to touch it,they looked over the forest and the plain beyond. Three sets ofcoin-operated binoculars were there, but centuries of random vandalismhad left them smashed and useless, lying on the mossy stone flags.The pedestals, curiously, were gone. The hobbits had no coins withwhich they could have used the binocs at any rate, though for Morriethis would have presented only a small problem.   They stared for a while, but the absence of fast food joints,restaurants, supermarkets, cattle herds (Pipsqueak declared that healone could eat a cow raw, if Morrie would bring it down - which heknew that his cousin could), or any other food source soon broughttheir spirits lower than ever. "Helvites druttforpilte eplefitse,"Morrie swore in the obscure crime-patois he often fell into whenagitated. Pipsqueak squirmed at the mention of apple. "And I almostliked this forest!"   "Almost liked the Forest!  That's good!  That's uncommonly good ofyou," said a strange voice, "especially considering that uncommonlyugly mood you seem to be in. Turn round and let me see your faces. Ialmost feel like squishing you like snails in the garden, but snailsmake such a yucky mess on the floor inside afterwards. I can neverscrape them entirely off my feet, those stupid slimy tubes of jello.Turn round!"  A large hand, reminding Pipsqueak of the metal skeletonof the Terminator's hand in Terminator I, grabbed each of them by theshoulder, and they were spun 540 degrees faster than one ofPipsqueak's tops. Then two large arms lifted them, somewhat moregently. Suddenly gaping down from what seemed almost high enough forbungee-jumping did little to settle their fear. They felt a tinglingin the soles of their feet.   They found themselves looking at a most extraordinary face, if faceit was. It belonged to a tall and thin figure, easily fourteen feet,though the legs were very short and thick. The face was at least fourtimes as long as it was broad, and at first glance it consisted simplyof glass, out of which the bright orange glare seared. Beneath it wasa beard like a steel brush. Whether the creature was clad in greentights like Robin Hood or some ecological Rudolf Nureyev, or that wasjust green paint, was hard to tell.   As the hobbits squinted and looked closer, the outline of a mouthas a crack in the glass and a pair of eyes behind it became evident.The eyes regarded them with a glitter of suspicion, though not, to thehobbits' minds, with any active malice.   "Hrum, Hoom," murmured the creature, and then spat a gob of slimeoff the edge of the cliff. "Very odd!  The more haste the less speed,that is my motto. Good for you that I heard your voices before Isaw you. You look like those detestable brats from the publicschools, the Orcs. But you don't sound like them, with your accents.Eplefitse indeed!"  Morrie thanked his lucky stars for havingretained his syndicate sociolect even through his schooldays.   Pipsqueak had found himself transfixed by that glare, like a rabbitilluminated at night by an approaching car. He had bared his frontteeth. Now the light subsided, and he could think again.   "Please, sir," he said, "who are you?  And what are you?"   An amused look came into the eyes deep within the glass. "Hrum,now," the apparition cleared its throat in answer, "I am a Ment.The Ment, you might say. Guardians of the lamp-posts in this forest.Fungang is my name according to some. In Westron that becomesSteelbeard."   "Ironbeard," whispered Morrie to Pipsqueak.   "But what's a Ment?" asked Pipsqueak. "Where do you come from?You look like a walking talking lamp-post to me."  Morrie pinchedhim viciously in the side, but Pipsqueak was too used to that to evennotice.   "Yes," replied the Ment, "well, hroom, my first memory is of asinging lion that walked through this forest. Excellent baritone.Wide range, too. That answers the where, I suppose. And then acold-eyed, tall woman who fled towards the mountains. Jadis, Ibelieve her name was. Queen Berúthiel to others."  The Ment's voicebecame dark and sullen. "Not related to that Galadriel at all, nomatter what silly newspapers say!"   "A singing lion??" gaped Morrie.   "Yes, I know it sounds absolutely ridiculous," replied the tallstreetlamp solemnly, its sodium glare oscillating slowly with innerthought. "Perhaps I remember incorrectly. It is a long time ago, andI was just awakened, for the first time."  Then he cleared his throatagain.   "What about you?" he continued. "Who are you?  I have never seenthe likes of you. You look like excessively overweight midget-men.You do not seem to fit into the old lists."  The hobbits glared, butthe Ment took no notice. "But perhaps they have made new lists.Let's see.        Gabble by rote now the Gits and Rascals!        First name the four, the funny peoples:        Snobs above all, the snickering Elves;        Dwarf the dealer, deep is his wallet;        Ment the Mighty, best and blessed;        Man the mocker, master of commerce;   Hm, hm, hm,        Pig gives pork, prawns are tasty;        Fish are fishy, foxes tasty;        Giraffes are grand, goats are tasty;   Hm, hm, hm. Repetitive, those old lists ---        Cats are cuddly, cows give milk;        Rats are rodents, roaches icky;        Enormous elephant, ents are tree-like...   Hm, hoom, it was a long list altogether. But you don't fit in itanywhere."   "Good," murmured Morrie to himself. To Morrie's family, obscurityuntil the knife was poised for the plunge had been a survival traitfor generations. But Pipsqueak remained true to himself:   "Why not make a new line?  Healthy hobbits, hale hole-dwellers.Put us just above the Elves and you have it!"  Again he failed tonotice the Pinch of Morrie.   "Hm, not bad," said Steelbeard. "So you live in holes, eh?  Allriiight. We'll put you in right after the Ments, perhaps. And yournames, please?"   Morrie remained silent. Taught and re-taught by experience, hekept his fingers still, though twitching:   "Yes, yes, I'm Paragraph Took, Pipsqueak to most..."   "Pipkin to some..."   "...and my companion is Moribund Brandybuck. But people just callhim Morrie. Or just Moe. We live in the country of The Shire,Whôzat in Westron, it's in what used to be Arnor, Arthurdame to bemore precise (you know, there was this king with a round table, andhis wife, and...), west of Bree, but east of the Tower Hills..."   As he drew a deep breath to continue, Morrie asked hurriedly: "Butsurely you must be tired of holding us up like this. How about, um,inviting us home?  You have stood here some time, I guess. You mustbe, um, hungry too. Speaking of which, we are maybe a little peckishor something ourselves..."   "Well I'm starving!" exclaimed Pipsqueak. "I could eat anelephant raw, two of them if they were properly cooked ---"   The old Ment put the two hobbits on what passed for his shoulders,a sort of narrow collar of iron, and strode down the stairs. Once hereached the forest floor, he began striding westwards and up, furtherand further into the woods. At first he seemed to shake violently,and Morrie, thinking he recognised the signs, nursed some hopes ofpushing his Vala dust to Steelbeard. Then the hobbits looked down,and saw that his short legs beat a pace faster than those of a runningtoddler.   Straight through the forest he strode, passing many lamp-posts onhis way. Some of these never budged. Others lit up briefly ingreeting as he passed, while a few raised their hand and said "Howdy".As for the trees, if they were small enough and in his path, hesmashed them aside in a shower of budding leaves and scented yellowishsplinters. Morrie immediately ceased thinking of that Funganglamp-post import business.   Breakfast-time passed into brunch-time. Brunch-time passed intolunch-time. Lunch-time passed into noon-meal. Noon-meal passed intotwo-o'clock morsel, which passed into dinner-time and then desserttime, and second-dinner-time and second-dessert time. Not untilsupper-time did Steelbeard appear to slow down his pace. High uponthe foothills of Mt. Themattress, where the young Mentwash chatterednoisily in a stony bed (reminding the hobbits of yet another bodilyfunction which must be attended to), Steelbeard turned away from thestream and ascended a steep grassy slope.   Suddenly the hobbits saw a dark opening. Tall lamp-posts stoodthere, forming an aisle of lights which lit up progressively as theMent approached. The hobbits were impressed, until they saw theremote control in Steelbeard's hand. He strode into the aisle, whichstood between the upward-sloping walls of a gorge. The lamp-postsalso grew progressively taller as he walked further in.   The gorge ended abruptly in a wall with a shallow cave at thebottom. Down the face of the wall came a small stream that hadescaped from the springs of the Mentwash above. It formed a spraylike a falling bead-curtain before the mouth of the cave and filled abasin and from there flowed in a channel along the aisle, until itrejoined the Mentwash below the slope behind. Behind the waterycurtain there stood a stone table and a low bed. Fifteen feet long.Next to the bed was a box of large lightbulbs, presumably for theaisle of lamps. There was no other furniture.   "There," said Steelbeard. "I have brought you seventy thousandMent-strides, each of which is about one meter in your measurement.This," pointing at the chattering channel beneath the basin, "is myurinal. You may pass water there. Not into the collecting channelsabove the basin, or I'll rip your spines out of your bodies!"  Thehobbits, put on the floor, quickly availed themselves of the offerwith many an aah and about time.   "Where do we pass hraka?" Morrie asked.   "Um, hroom, Ments never eat."  (The hearts of the hobbits made apanicky dash into their toes.)  "We drink only. So we never, whatchacall it, pass hraka?"   Then he strode over to the table, upon which stood several stonejars. Three of these he filled from one of the channels that ran intothe basin, and sprinkled something into them. Immediately they beganto glow with a light like many blended neonlights, and go slightly"gloop gloop". The largest of these he set before himself, and thetwo smaller he gave to the hobbits. These jars were almost as tall asthe hobbits themselves, and they had to climb onto them and dip theirmouths into the water.   "Whhy, Eru allmatey, thisshis --- sgoods Farmer Maggisssecretess --- t! --- sheeeketessht mmushroomsh concocshon ooh --- Igottagottagotta have shommme more ---"   The drink was actually like pure spring-water, except for thebubbles and the lightshow. But then the hobbits felt a tingling intheir feet, and the effect rose steadily through every limb, until itreached their heads, and then Oh God!  Suddenly they felt as vigorousas they had ever done. Indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on theirheads was actually standing up, waving and curling and growing, andthen falling off. The entirely bald Steelbeard saw no problem withthis, and indeed it seemed the only adverse side-effect of theMent-brew. After some time, the psychedelic effect began to wear off.   One effect of the brew was to take permanent effect, though.Forever after the two hobbits would walk with their feet two inchesabove the ground. It was the last they would ever feel of stone orshort-mown grass beneath their feet, unless weighed down with a heavyload. Even Farmer Maggot's secret mushrooms had succeeded only incausing this effect temporarily.   "You still haven't told me what you are doing in my country," saidSteelbeard, now lying on the bed, or rather, bobbing a few inchesabove it. "There's quite a lot I should like to know, about the Orcswho were just clobbered outside my forest, about Gandalf (who owes mea tidy sum, let me tell you, but otherwise he's quite a fine guy,always has a large bottle in his hat), about that Aruman or whateverhis name is nowadays, and are Galadriel and Arwen as sensuous as theysay..."  For a moment the two hobbits remained quiet. Then Morriespoke, Pipsqueak for once having the sense to bottle up.   "We come, ash you...shorry, as you know, from Whôzat. We leftwith another hobbit and his servant..."  And so Morrie continued,until he had covered as much of the story as he felt fit to tell.This left quite some gaping holes in his tale, but Steelbeard, thoughlistening intently and putting several questions, didn't push him.   "Hm, this is a bundle of news," said Steelbeard at last. "Thoughyou have hardly told me all that you know, not by a long shot.Keeping a lot from me, I believe."  He looked at Morrie with asearching eye. Morrie stared back with practised blankness. "But nodoubt you are doing exactly as Gandalf would wish. Good lads!"Pipsqueak beamed; Morrie scowled behind his face. Sam would havebusied himself making dynamite bombs in his mind, had he been there."By paint and glass, but this is a strange business: up sprout anunknown people, though they may not sprout very tall; and theforgotten Nazdaq Riders rise up to pursue them, and Gandalf takes themout scouting, and El Rond fills them with margarita until it comes outof their ears, and Galadriel shows them her favours, both of them (isshe really such a babe as they say?), and Arwen accompanies them (isshe really such a leather-and-lash victrix as I've heard?), and Orcstry to initiate them, and Sauron and Aruman both hunt them with legalforms: indeed they seem to be caught up in the Mother of all legalhassles. I hope they weather it!"   "No legal hassles are too complicated to solve with a few BywaterGrins," replied Morrie, with a calm assurance based on experience andgenerations of family history. "But what about yourself?  What's yourrelationship with Aruman?"   "Hocch, not too good, not too good," was Steelbeard's reply. "Hebegan his career as one of the Good Guys, you know. Always a flask inthe hat. Together with Gandalf he was the best damn wizard that evercame out of Roke since Sparrowhawk, whose true name was Ged. Used tobe Archmage too. Some jolly booze-ups we had, Aruman, Gandy andmyself. But he has been tight-fisted with his spirits lately. And hehas started a school for boys down at Isengard, if you'll believe it.Well, you do, of course. His pupils are all Orcs: always up tomischief. Wandering around in the outskirts of my forest!  Full ofpranks, too. They'd cut down a tree and leave it to rot as soon aslook at it. No harm in that, of course, but they do the same to thelamp-posts!  Pull them down with ropes, carry them off to be remeltedin the forges of Isengard. That's what they need the trees for.Smashing the glass with slingshots, just for fun. Sniffing the gasfrom the gas-lamps ---   "I think I know what he is up to. He is plotting to become aCorporation, or the manager of one. He has some kind of arms-for-weedtrade with some obscure rat-country up north ---" the hobbits scowled"--- and he is using those detestable pupils as cheap labour, bloodyscabs. And he's up to worse. It is the mark of evil things that camein the Great Darkness that they cannot abide grassy lawns, especiallyduring the sunlit hours: they positively blossom with allergies, butAruman's pupils can endure them even if they hate them. I wonder whathe has done. Are they Celebrity Journalists he has ruined with hisbribes, or has he blended the races of Corporate Lawyers andLiterature Critics?  That would be, well, an amusing prank come tothink of it.   "I have to put a stop to this!  I have been idle too long!  Sod thatbastard!"  Morrie beamed.   Steelbeard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, andthumped his hand on the table. It broke in two with a loud crackand a clatter of stone jars. The two vessels that the hobbits haddrunk from trembled and sent up two jets of flame, which scorched theceiling and then caused them to rocket out of the cave, much to theconsternation of the hobbits. Steelbeard took no notice.   "I will stop it!" he boomed. "You'll be welcome to hang aroundhere until I come back."  The hobbits, who knew that even the bestmushroom liquor could not make up for lack of solid food, politelyoffered to come along rather, if he would have them; Morrie thought ofpossible rich looting in the ruins of Isengard.   "Suit yourselves, midgets," shrugged Steelbeard. "But whatever youhope to accomplish is beyond me."   The next morning the hobbits woke to find a cool sun shining intothe Ment-house. Steelbeard was not to be seen, and that was ablessing: his sodium glare had kept them awake most of the night. Asthey were done washing themselves in the basin and just about to startsearching for whatever powder Steelbeard had put into those jars theday before, they heard him returning.   "Hoo boy!  Good morning, Morrie and Pipsqueak!" he said to them."You sleep long!"   "Not as long as you think," murmured Morrie with ayawn.   "I have been many hundred Ment-strides already," Steelbeardcontinued. "Now we will have a drink, and go to Mentmoot."   He poured them out two stone bowls of water, and sprinkledsomething into them. Immediately the lightshow (difficult to see now,in the morning sun) and the "gloop gloop" started; but they weredifferent colours from the evening before, and the water lesspsychedelic and more sustaining, more food-like so to say. Thehobbits were reminded of the brownies made from old "Belladonna"Took's famous recipe, which had earned her her nickname. While theydrank, Steelbeard stood impatiently tapping his toes.   "Where is Mentmoot," Pipsqueak ventured to ask.   "Hoo, hocch?  Mentmoot?  It's not a place, it's a gathering ofMents. Just wait until you see the blended light of half a hundredagitated Ments --- though it doesn't often happen nowadays. But Ihave managed to twist a fair number of arms this morning. We shallmeet in the place where we have always met: Darndingle Men call it. Iknow precisely why: they always go 'darn darn darn' and cover theireyes on those rare occurrences when they come across a Mentmootthere." He chuckled. "It is away south from here. We must be therebefore noon."   "Um, you wouldn't happen to have some sun-glasses fit for us?"asked Pipsqueak.   Steelbeard made no reply. He lifted them up onto his shoulders andat once set off. At the entrance to the court he kicked one of thespent and sooty jars aside and turned right. At once he startedhumming to himself. Or so it seemed for quite a while to the hobbits.They caught no proper words, but rather things like "Boom doom boomdoom crack boodoom rumboom boom". Then they noticed the large drumhe was carrying, beating on it with his large hands as he walked; andof course the occasional crack of a young tree being splintered out ofthe Ment's way.   During a pause in the Ment's drumming, Pipsqueak said: "I found asuit of Orc-armour just before we met you, down by the river. Itseemed to have belonged to one of Aruman's boys, you know, Cedríc'scrowd. Do you know what it was doing there?'  Steelbeard made noreply, but immediately resumed drumming. Morrie was not too deep inthought to notice this.   They had been going for a long while - Pipsqueak had tried to keepcount of the "ment-strides", but had lost count before ten - whenSteelbeard began to slacken his heron's pace. Suddenly he stopped,and raising his hands to his mouth let out a great call. Hoom hoom!The hobbits went ringing deaf for several minutes, and failed to hearthe answering calls in the distance.   At once he resumed walking, now and then sending out anotherhorn-call; the hobbits covered their ears each time. As their hearingreturned, they noticed the answering hollers, progressively louder andnearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like animpenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that thehobbits did not recognize, which didn't rule out a lot of tree-kinds:they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in darkglossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff uprightflower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.   Most of the trees in this hedge were of one size and height, butsome of them were younger and smaller. Steelbeard strode straightahead, smashing through the hedge without slackening his pace andignoring the opening not far to his left. Fortunately he had theforethought of lifting the hobbits up above his head; otherwise theywould have been horribly scratched or even impaled on theflower-spikes. Once inside the hedge the hobbits found themselves onthe lip of a bowl-shaped dingle in the land. Already a number ofMents were standing in the bottom ("Hey, Steelbeard, why cantcherleave the bloody 'edge undamaged just for once?"), and an equalnumber were striding down the slope, having come through openings inthe north, east and west.   As they drew near the hobbits gazed at the Ments. They hadexpected to see a number of creatures as much like Steelbeard as onehobbit is like another; and they were very much surprised to seenothing of the kind. The Ments were as different from each other asone lamp-post is from another (duh!): some small, quaint, with littlegas-lights in them and made of brass, some large lamps like the oneslining roads, on aluminium poles, some like bill-boards with a host ofmany-coloured little lightbulbs and cheery, well-illuminatedexhortations to eat at Durin's Last Stand (Over 140 Served), some likewooden telephone poles with lamps affixed to them, some (the tallestMents) like the floodlights illuminating sports fields. These stoodand moved like something out of Jurassic Park, and Pipsqueak giggledin a way that would have done Giggly the Dverg honour. Yet as theycame close, the hobbits saw that they were of the same kind asSteelbeard, and all had the same eyes (ie. the same kind of eyes,not sharing a single pair between them or something): not all so oldand so deep, but with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression(almost zombie-like, until one saw the awareness within those wells),and their voices were much like his.   And yes, they lit up with a light strong and bright enough almostto flash-cook the hobbits, who would have gone blind had they notcovered their eyes with their arms. Steelbeard put them down andpresented them, cowering two inches above the turf, to the otherMents, and then they took their leave as fast as they could. A fewseconds later they sat panting shoulder-deep in a little pool in thestream that ran into the dingle, removing their scorched outergarments.   "Oh Eru, not only have we gone bald as palantíri (whatever theyare; it's Gandalf's expression), but it looks like we have got aflash-tan now to make us look like, um, some of those minorities ---"   "Yes," replied Morrie. "I didn't know what the Ments could do toIsengard. I believe it is encircled by a ring of stone, like a tallcastle-wall. But those Ments look like they could melt their waythrough. I wish I could take some of them home to melt some of thoseSoB's," meaning the Sackville-Bagginses.   The hobbits went in search of berries and fruits, realizing after afew hours that fruits and berries, ripe or unripe, are not plentifulin early spring. Then Pipsqueak set some snares for rabbits instead,having saved the ropes that the Orcs had tied them with, and splittingthem lengthwise into strings fit for a rabbit's neck. Having a dozenTwinkies while they waited, they listened to the conclave in thedingle behind the hedge. Steelbeard's horn-calls and drum had madethem expect a similar music from the Ments; but instead they foundthemselves listening to violins and their larger cousins, to guitars(electric and unplugged), flutes, several percussion sets, variousbrass instruments, and at least two pianos and an organ. The music ofthe Mentmoot was rather pleasant to the ears, and happily not as loudas the Ment-light was bright.   Possibly the rabbits of Themattress thought the same, for an hourlater the hobbits had three coneys (and the traps set again), and abright fire ready to roast them. Morrie's several concealed daggerswere ample to skin and prepare them, and his regard for Pipsqueakincreased to at least 4 on that scale from 0 to 100. As they caughttwo more coneys while eating the other three, to 4½ or so. He evenbegan to feel pleased that he had failed to lose his squeaky-voicedcousin in Moira.   As they were belching after the fifth rabbit and picking theirteeth with their finger-nails, they heard the orchestra in the dinglebecoming quiet. Then they saw Steelbeard striding towards them inthat gait which never failed to amuse them; and with him came anotherMent.   "Hm, hroom, hocch, here I am again," said Steelbeard. "Are yougetting weary, or feeling impatient, hmm, eh, eh, eh, nudge, nudge,knowwhatImean?  Well, I am afraid that you must keep your spirits up awhile more. Here's some of my secret powder to help you to do that.Just a single grain of it in a cupful of water seems enough foryou."  He handed them a little plastic bag each with somemany-coloured powder in them. The hobbits beamed as if they wereMents themselves.   "Also I have brought you a companion. We have still much todiscuss, but Bregalad here says that he has already made up his mindand needs not remain at the Moot. Hm, he is the nearest thing amongus to a hasty Ment. You ought to get on together. Good-bye."Steelbeard turned and left them.   Bregalad stood a while surveying the hobbits solemnly, or so itseemed to them, until they saw his feet a few inches above the turf.He was a tall Ment, and seemed to be one of the younger ones. Hisface was a single white lamp upon an aluminium pole. He held a largecello-case in his hand.   As his feet reached the turf again, he began slowly to focus on thehobbits. Then he spoke. "Ha hmm, my frien's, less go --- go --- fora walk. Home."  He paused for a few minutes, and then, starting towalk, spoke more clearly.   "My name is Bregalad, that is Quickbeam in your language. That'sjust a nickname, of course. I have been called that ever since I saidyes to and elder Ment more than a week before he finished hisquestion. Also I drink quickly, and sober up before most of thembegin to levitate. Speaking of which, you seem to be high enoughright now."  Morrie quickly explained how they had remained a fewinches above the ground even after the concoction had otherwise wornoff. "And mighty useful too if it lasts," commented Pipsqueak, "nexttime he bolts through the forest with a posse of Sackville-Bagginsestrying to track him!"   Quickbeam's Ment-house was nearby. It consisted only of a fewlamp-posts surrounding a well in a bank. His cello-case he stored inthe vault. After depositing it, Quickbeam filled a large bottle withwater and added some dust from the bag that Pipsqueak had received,and the rest of that day they spent very pleasantly, passing thebottle between them as they walked through the landscape laughing.   For Quickbeam laughed a lot. But then again, so did the hobbits,floating serenely hand in hand with Quickbeam above the grass. Theylaughed at every gust of wind, they laughed when they saw a flower;they rolled with laughter at the sight of an early fly. The hobbitseven forgot to catch more rabbits and eat. But Quickbeam laughed themost.   And whenever he passed a tall lamp-post like himself, he raised hisarms and laughed warmly at it. And these lamp-posts invariably shoneforth, raising their right hand and saying "Howdy".   At nightfall he brought them back to his house, and they spent afew hours sitting behind the desks like tellers without any money tocount (to Morrie's disappointment), listening to the music from thenearby Darndingle, and also to Quickbeam's stories, for they hademptied the bottle and refrained from refilling it. From Quickbeamthey learnt that he belonged to Bignarc's people, and his country hadbeen ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his"hastiness", at least in the matter of Orcs.   "There were streetlamps there, tall streetlamps that took root whenI was young, on the old ground where an ancient aluminium plant stoodmillennia ago. They lit up the forest with their light, andboyscouts, and the rescue workers coming to save them, were glad oftheir light. But then the boyscouts began carrying their own torches,and the Forest Service was disbanded, leaving the boyscouts to starveand die and rot. And then Orcs came with ropes, and some came withbulldozers, and they uprooted and overturned the streetlamps, and theycarried them to Isengard, to be turned into badges and dinner-plates,pots and, well, new lamps of Aruman's fashioning. And I walked thedead pastures, and I called their beautiful names, but they answerednot, and they were gone. They were gone. They lay dead in Isengard.   O Tarasilë, Celeb-Aglar, Ivunaurië   O streetlamp tall, I heard your call, so beautiful a sound   I saw your bright and lovely light, it round around me wound   Lamp-post slender, movements tender, joy before my eyes   O Lofty Shine, a light so fine, a mind so kind and wise   Silver Glory, how your story ended in despair   O Alu-Flame of lasting fame, you are no longer here   O Tarasilë, Celeb-Aglar, Ivunaurië"   So lamenting in many tongues the fall of aluminium-wroughtlamp-posts whom he had loved, Quickbeam sang himself to sleep. Thetwo hobbits stifled a few yawns and dozed off rather quickly too.   The next day they spent in Quickbeam's house, or near it, for ithad gotten colder. Pipsqueak set a few snares, and caught a fewrabbits, though fewer than the day before. He and Morrie ate the lastof their Twinkies, and those and three coneys were far from enough tosate their hunger properly; but a pinch of Steelbeard's dust in a fewbottles of water kept their spirits up despite this. And all day themusic came from the Mentmoot, sometimes hardly audible, at other timesrising to a great and quickening chorus.   The second night passed, and still the Ments kept awake anddiscussing. Then the third day of the Moot dawned. Pipsqueak set hissnares, but rabbits were warier now, and they had to share one, and asmall one at that. It was Pipsqueak who had the snares, but Morriehad the knives and the absolute lack of scruples, and so he had thelargest share: Pipsqueak was left gnawing half a foreleg and anothergrudge.   As the day wore on, the sound from the dingle grew more and morequiet. Quickbeam listened intently, but did not respond toPipsqueak's queries. Near sunset the Moot suddenly grew absolutelyquiet. A few minutes passed in dead silence, and then suddenly came agreat ringing shout from many voices: Hoom raah, room haah, glugglug, hand over that bottle, haah hoom, soomma summaroom!  With thatmore than fifty Ments came striding up from the dingle, withoutbending a blade of the grass which grew a few inches below their bigfeet. Then the Ments struck a marching tune. Quickbeam said nothing,but hurried in to fetch his cello.   We come, we come with mighty fun: ta-runda runda runda run!   The Ments came near to Quickbeam's house, singing louder andlouder. They had all their instruments with them, and they wereplaying them. How the Ment with the organ managed to play it whilemarching cannot be described; you must just trust the narrator onthis.   We come with fiddle, horn and drum: ta-rna rûna rûna rum!   Quickbeam picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.   Before long he met the column of Ments, two abreast, Steelbeard attheir head, laughing and vigorously beating his drum. Quickbeamquickly swung into the line beside Steelbeard, pushing the Mentalready there aside. He put the hobbits onto Steelbeard's shouldersand started playing his cello, smaller to his hands than a violin to ahuman.   "Hoom, hom!  Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!"called Steelbeard, nearly rupturing the eardrums of the hobbitsperched next to his mouth. "Come with the Moot!  Are we gonna kicksome serious ass!  Off to Isengard!"   "To Isengard!" the Ments slurred in many voices.   "To Isengard!   To Isengard!  The Iron-hard is ringed and barred by wizard's might   We do not care: let him beware: he'll get his share: we'll take our right   The man who marred, be he on guard: he will be tarred and feathered down   When we come there we'll get in gear: he will feel fear and look a clown!   We Ments are best: our final jest shall be a fest of splintered wall   With voice of doom and rolling boom, and hocch and hoom and Jericho-call!   So they sang, increasingly steadily as the concoction wore off ontheir march southwards. The hobbits stuffed their ears withpocket-lint and used Twinkie-wrappers thoughtfully saved for thepurpose.   The Ments, even when they ceased hovering and walked directly onthe ground, marched with great speed. From the dingle they descendedinto a deep fold of the land, breaking aside any of the few trees thatmight be standing in the way. Now they walked in silence, except forthe occasional crack of living wood, spilling the rising sap of earlyspring in fragrant showers. As they ascended the long slope,Pipsqueak looked back. In the failing daylight he at first thoughtthat he must be seeing things, but the many points of light could notlong be mistaken: the fifty-odd Ments from the Moot had grown tothousands of lamp-posts striding, each of them shining with one ormore bright points of light. There were many colours, thoughpredominantly white or whitish yellow. They looked like a marchingcity at night. Aruman must surely see that as soon as they reachedthe top of the incline, unless they put out their lights!   Then the hobbits sighed with relief. Just as they were about topour over the top of the last ridge before Nan Curunír, the Ments andthe lamp-posts, one by one as they came within direct sight of thegreat stone ring and the tower within it, turned off their lights.Now they stood in the early darkness of night on the high slopes abovethe Wizard's Vale.   "Night lies over Isengard," said Steelbeard, and passed round abottle that went "gloop gloop".
       "Damn, it's cold!" chortled Giggly, doing a very odd version of the Macarena.Day had finally come.... well, sort of... they thought it was day... it was socloudy that they couldn't see five feet in front of them (except for Lego-lass,who could see perfectly in lowlight and detect secret passageways, to boot).But they had slept a good four hours and were ready to start looking forhobbit-prints again.       "And don't forget that old man!" said Giggly. "I should be happier if he lefta few prints behind."       "Why would that make you happy?" said Legolas.       "Ummmm..... I dunno."       "It doesn't really matter anyway. Aragon only LOOKs like he knows what he'sdoing. AND it was an evil wraith-like-thingy that looks like Aruman and doesn'tLEAVE footprints. Saruman is at LEAST high-experience technocracy mage. Maybe athaumaturgist, actually, but I'm not so sure."       "A thauma-whatza?"       Aragon spoke from the ground, where he indeed looked like he knew what he wasdoing. "Thaumaturgists. Freaky undead who make your blood boil. Ex-wizards.Love to study."       "Make your blood boil? Well, I should say!"       Lego-lass got them back on track. "So... any IDEAS, Aragon? About the horses,I mean, not the Thaumaturgists. Where did they GO?"       "Wherever they went they sure sounded happy. But I can't read the riddlewithout a Wits + Animal Ken die pool of at least 7, re-roll 10s or not."Lego-lass gave a small hmph. "So we look first and guess later! How bout wesearch the bodies? You and Giggly go over there--" here he motioned to a placefar off to the east "--and look for clues. I'll continue over here." One lastglare from Lego-lass and the two were off. Aragon smirked to himself. He thenturned to the woods behind him. "It's all right. You can come out now, MyMorningstar!"       For some time, the companions---- [******* all questionable moments have beencensored for lack of plot vitality and occasional sadomasochism which may beunpleasant for some readers. These deletions will be noted by a small sequenceof stars; *********, often combined with an interjection of asort ******] ----Suddenly, she saw Lego-lass and Giggly running toward them,warned Aragon, and rushed back into the woods, but not before pointing towardsa more functional element to the plot: the next clue.       "This is odd... twinkie wrappers in a place like this...."       Lego-lass put in her two cents. "Well, OBVIOUSLY it was one of the hobbits.NOBODY else would have TWINKIE wrappers."       Giggly did the usual thing. "Heehee."       Lego-lass continued. "And you've MISSED something. There's that freaky-lookingOLD guy again."       "How can you tell? It's about as foggy as....."       "I got FIVE successes."       "Stupid elf-dice."       Lego-lass smirked and pointed. Giggly followed her finger and exclaimed, nearlaughter, "I see him! He looks like Santa Claus after a bonfire!"       Indeed, emerging from the mists was one of the fattest creatures ever known tobe humanoid. He was as wide as an average desktop, and clad head to toe in verydirty grey rags. He was also wearing a funny blue hat that seemed to be alittle bit small for him.       Lego-lass drew her bow, and pointed. "Die, thaumaturgist, DIE!" She lookedlike she was about to actually DO it, she pulled back and let the bow hang tothe ground. "What's wrong???...." She began to get a slightly homicidal look inher eyes. "....why can't I....." And then suddenly she lashed about with herknife, nearly stabbing Aragon where it might have hurt, shrieking "WHAT'S WRONGWITH ME?!?!?!?"       "Calm down, Mistress Elf," stated the fat guy. "I am no thaumaturgist, and Iwish to speak with you and your nearly impaled comrades." With that he jumpedway too lightly for his size onto a nearby rock, revealing a glimpse of whitecloth for about a nanosecond, and leaving the comrades bewildered. "Besides,you couldn't kill me if you tried."       "You speak as one that knows..... (get off me, you stupid elf) .....theprofession well.... (stupid!)....." Aragon attempted to say while Lego-lass wasat his throat. "Is that...." here he picked up the renegade elf and threw herinto Giggly, who lived up to his name and chuckled, "...so?"       "Not well," said the fat old man, "that would be the study of many lives.Caine leaves a long legacy. But I kill now and again. Why, I was just recentlyin a glorious battle, with this really screwed-up slimy guy in Khazad-Mum, andhe almost beat me! But I gave him one good...."       Lego-lass stopped her assault, got off of Giggly (but not without a quickwink), and whispered in awe, "Mii-miii.. ...Mesprendeur?"       "No shit, Sherlock."       With that minor vulgarity he disrobed (cringe!!! cringe!!!), and jumped offthe rock, clad now in robes of white that only made him look even more obese.The little blue hat gave place to a little white yamaka (some spell ityarmakule, in the old elvish), and the great sword Gimidhat was sheathed at hisside.       At last Aragon stirred. "Gandalf! What the hell happened to you? You'reall---"       "White? Yeah, sure. It's an honor thing. Guess what? Aruman's beenexcommunicated! I have the honors both of telling him and replacing him. Howabout that?"       "Yes, sir, but the---"       "Yeah, I miss the grey one too. But that dratted Balrog went and burned it!Luckily I was able to save my hat..."       "Tell us about the Balrog!" called Giggly.       "Well, we fought. it was fun. I whacked at him several dozen times withGimidhat, he got all slimy and whipped me. Then we took it outside, and Ifinally beat him. After I diablorized the schmuck---"       Lego-lass gasped. "You did WHAT?!"       "Diablorized him. Took his soul. Quite a rush, really." He smirked knowingly.       Aragon tried to ask, "Is that what made you so---"       "Powerful? Yes, but not the whole thing. Dha-Manwë helped out quite a bit,when I got to talk to him."       It was Giggly's turn to gasp. "You mean, you got to meet Dha-Manwë and comeback to tell us about it?"       "Yes. Gwaihir the Windlord picked me up after the diablorization of the Balrog(oh, and by the way, he was very impressed that I could still---[****** bestiality, yaoi, and vulgarity; a triple threat!*******] ---afterall these years!" The Elf, Man, and Dwerrat stood blinking while Gandalf continued."So he takes me to see Dha-Manwë, and I get powered up and sent back to helpyou people. Plus I get the new white garb. By the by," he turned and modeled itfor the others, "does this robe make me look fat?"       There was an extended sequence of blinking on the parts of Lego-lass andGiggly. Aragon tried to speak up. "Well, I was beginning to wonder what wasmaking you so---"       "Luminescent?"       "Ummm, no....more like---"       "Patronizing? Commanding?"       Aragon gave an exasperated sigh and a sweatdrop, and collapsed to the groundin frustration. With his head to his knees, he whined, "What of the Hobbits?"       "Two go by the river, two go by the lampposts. You know which are which, andthey're all alive, so far."       "And they're safe?"       "More or less. Right now it's giving you these messages that I'm concernedabout, and packing you off to Edoras."       A small thud was heard in the trees nearby, and a clump of black leather wasseen on the floor. Gandalf sauntered over to it and gave it a quick slap acrossthe less-covered end.       A disheveled Arwen arose with a sheepish look on her face. "Ummm....hi,guys!....errr..."       Gandalf got the famous insanely patronizing look upon his face. "Do you knowwhat I do to eavesdroppers, Princess?"       "If it's as famous as what you do to eagles, I'm looking forward to it."       Dark glare from Aragon. A VERY dark glare, indeed.       "No, actually, although that might become an option...."       Even darker glare from Aragon, accompanied by a hand on the hilt of a famousreforged sword. "You wouldn't dare."       "Get that hand off your sword, son of Arathon, or I will personally see thatthe one I'm here to fight for is cut off. And that will be of muchdisappointment to Morningstar here, won't it?"       Aragon growled slightly, but moved his hand.       "Much better. Now where was I? oh yes, what I do to eavesdroppers. YOU,princess, will be traveling with us..."       Arwen breathed a small rapturous "Yes!".       "...but will not be permitted to engage in any combat or physical action. Thatincludes sex."       Aragon and Arwen's jaws dropped a good 3 feet. Lego-lass and Giggly snickered.Gandalf smiled.       "Consider the fun you had this morning to be the last you will get for therest of the voyage." More snickering from Lego-lass. "You also will not beallowed to fight, or I will personally blow you to the Lonely Isle, or worse,[****** just......disgusting ******], and spoil your children to hell. Andif you, Mr. Heir of Elendil, try to stop me, you can kiss the quest, the crown,and your family jewels good-bye!"       Giggly was starting to roll on the floor.       Aragon muttered under his breath, "At least I can see mine, fatty." Gandalfdidn't hear. Instead, he continued with his speech.       "I was given messages to you three from Galadriel. Aragon first;               Where now are those ghuls of yours, El Lesser, El Lesser?               Why do thy valderie-bound wander afar?               Near are the days of a black, sunless sky,               As a moon shines with blood and we're all gonna die.               But much darker still is the road you must take;               Thank god that your lineage isn't all fake!Now I was HOPING to bear better news, but I guess that it's not gonna happen,so I go to Lego-lass now;               Lego-lass Greenbutt, longest in limb;               You're out of your mind if you think about him!               The Dwerrow is mine, and if you even try               I will hunt your ass down 'til you're ready to die!I thought that one was particularly interesting...."       Lego-lass was turning redder than the eye of Sauron. Whether it was with rageor embarrassment, nobody could tell. But Giggly was laughing as if there wereNitrous oxide being spoon fed to her personally by a half-orc in a tutu. Arwenand Aragon, meanwhile, were wondering whether of not their beloved Grandma hadreally written that...       Gandalf continued. "There was also one for you, Laughing Boy, but I don't planto say it publicly...." he went over to a much more sobered Giggly andwhispered in his ear for a good 15 minutes, as Lego-lass whetted her knife andAragon and Arwen undressed each other with their eyes. When the whispering wasdone, Giggly was at least twice as red as Lego-lass had been, and yellingthrough his laughter, "How the [insert potent dwarven swear word here] did youremember all that?!"       "It's an old routine."       "[potent dwarven swear word]!!!!"       "Well, a phrase like [****** odd. Very very odd. ******] isn't exactlyhard to forget, especially after it's been done so many times." Silence from all butGiggly.        Arwen's jaw dropped. "Grandma is one sick cookie."       "....Right." Gandalf whistled and then spoke to the others. "Well, it's timeto go."       Giggly chortled. "But.... I can't exactly... walk.....!"       The results of the whistle were observed as the footsteps of horses were heardnearby.       "There is more than one horse coming."       "You lost two, I brought one, and a third is tagging along for our littlerenegado."       The horses ran up to Gandalf, with the exception of one of the new ones, whojust lolled in the grass. That one seemed to be Gandalf's, because the instanthe lay down, the fat Wizard was shouting at it.        "Come on, Slimshadë, please stand up! Please stand up! Stupid damn horse!Slimshadë, please! Stand up!!! You can be such a good horse, when you put yourmind to it! Come ON, Slimshadë!!!"       Aragon piped in. "Ummm, where did he take our horses?"              "Just to get a wider view of the area."       "Right.... wider....."       "What was that, young man?"       "I said right, wider.... er, I mean White Rider... no... nevermind. What isthat sound in the distance?" He pointed toward Medusald, the hall of the gildedsnake, far to the north, and there was a faint trace of smoke as well.       "Battle and war! Ride on, Slimshadë!" And with that he jumped upon the horse(thankfully not squishing it) and rode into the distance, the others not farbehind.
    They rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gatheringnight, the monotony relieved only by Giggly asking "Are wethere yet?" every five minutes.  Gandalf allowed them only afew hours rest after Lego-lass fell out of her saddle and wasalmost trampled to death.  The waxing moon sank into thecloudy west, an important point to remember should you wishto draw up a table of moon positions to prove how wrong thetiming of the whole story is.    Suddenly The Horse Formerly Known As Slimshadë, beingfar more intelligent than normal horses (and probably farmore intelligent than anyone else in the book), stopped andneighed.  As the other horses caught up (he was the fastestas well) Lego-lass, Aragon, Giggly and Arwen got their firstglimpse of The Golden Hall.    The source of the smoke and metallic noise was alsorevealed.  In front of the hill on which the Hall stood,hundreds of Dunlending slaves were labourious turning thespits to roast thousands of chickens of an enourmousbarbecue.  A large sign above proclaimed 'Made by theMetalwork Dept. of Isengard School for Boys'.    "Lo!  It is the Great Hall of Medusald," cried Gandalf,pointing, "called The Golden Hall because of the largenumbers of golden dandelions which you can see growing onthe side of the hill and out of the guttering."    "Dandelions!?!" exclamied Giggly. "Am I to believe thatthere is no actual gold involved anywhere?"    "No."    "None?"    "None."    Giggly fell silent.    "Speak, Lego-lass, and tell us what you see," commandedGandalf.    "The same as the rest of you," Lego-lass responded overthe sound of Giggly's sobs. "What did you expect? Its only 50metres away."    "In that great building," Gandalf said, pointing at theHall, whose peeling paint and missing roofing tiles gave ita less than grand look, "HeyHoDen, king of the Rohirrim, holdshis court."    The travellers rode up to the Hall.  On either side theypassed ancient graves.  "Those on the left are the tombs ofthe kings, those on the right the tombs of the royal pets."    "I used to know a chant that would have been appropriatenow," said Aragon as they passed the tomb of Fuzzy, theRoyal Hamster, "but I've forgotten it."    "For that you should all be truly thankful," muttered Arwenunder her breath.    Surprisingly no one came to meet them until they reachedthe great (or shabby, depending on your point of view) doorsof the hall and dismounted, at which point an obese guardwobbled up to great them.    "Bonjour!" cried Gandalf in greeting.    The guard looked blank.  After a few seconds he let outthat great slogan of slobbish incomprehension: "Yer wha?"    "Bonjour, mon ami!" Gandalf persisted.    The guard turned to Aragon.  "Is this bloke mad or summin?"he asked.    Gandalf looked disappointed.  "Don't you speak the noblelanguage of the Rohirrim?"    "Don't be stupid, mate.  We gave up on that years ago.  Whowants a language where the verbs have so many forms no-onecan understand them, and the words are masculing andfemining?"    "Masculine and feminine," corrected Gandalf.    "Yeah, whatever.  Hang on a minute, I'm sure there'ssomething I should have said before." He rummaged in hispockets and pulled out a piece of paper.  "Here we go - 'Whogoes there?'" he read, sounding important, or as importantas a fat man in rusty chain mail can.    "Tell us who you are first," demanded Arwen irritably.    "Okay, babe."  Aragon winced on his behalf  "I'm Hammy, theDoorstop of HeyHoDen.  Now you."    Gandalf answered.  Aragon had been noticing with greatirritation how the wizard had assumed the role of leader."We are travelers from afar.  I am Gandalf the mightywizard, and these are Lego-lass and Arwen, the beautifulelves -" Lego-lass blushed, "-and this is Giggly, the craftyDwerrow; and this is Aragon, some bloke who comes with us."Aragon glared at Gandalf's large back, but remained silent.Bide your time, he thought to himself, wait until he's asleepone night, and then...    "Oh, I'd better let you in then.  First you must lay downyour weapons."    "I will not lay down my sword," growled Aragon, "for it isthe sword of Elendil reforged, that was broken under..."    "Look, I just want the weapon, not its life story," saidHammy, souding bored.    "Just give it to him," whispered Gandalf.  "We haven't gotall day to argue with idiots."    Reluctently, Aragon laid down his sword.  With it wentGiggly's axe and Lego-lass's bow.  "I must request that youleave your staff here, master Gandalf," said the guard.    "Idiot," Gandalf said, this time out loud.  "Would you denyan old man his stick?"    "The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a propfor age.  You could take somebody's eye out with that thing."    As Gandalf laid it agaist the wall, Aragon pulled faces athim and chanted "Nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah".    Arwen laid down her broadsword.  "I must ask for the knivesas well, babe." said Hammy.  Arwen growled and laid themdown.  "And the crossbow, and the morningstar, and theaxe..."    Gandalf, Aragon, Giggly and Lego-lass entered the hall,leaving behind Arwen and her innumerable weapons.  In thecentre of the enourmous hall there was a small square ofcarpet, covered in empty crisp packets, chicken bones andlager cans.  On this sat a small armchair, a large sofa, acoffee table and a strangely empty space.    "Greetings, HeyHoDen, King of Rohan," called Gandalf toanother fat man, this one, like Hammy, shabbily dressed, butwearing a tarnished crown and sitting in the armchair.  On thesofa sat Eowynn (who winked at Aragon) and a short, skinnyman with greasy hair.    "I return your greetings on behalf of the king," said theshort man.  "I am the chief of his counsellors, Grimey."    "So you are the one who some call Wormtongue."    "I am."  Lego-lass noticed the way in which his tongueflickered in and out of his mouth as he talked.  "Pray tellme what business you have with us, master Gandalf, who somecall Stormcrow!"    "Why do they call me Stormcrow?" said Gandalf, temporarilydistracted.    "For they say that wherever you go, bad news and troublefollows."    "So why Stormcrow?"    "I don't know! I didn't invent the nickname!"    "That is because you, Wormtongue, are too stupid to inventanything."    "Do not be so sure, master wizard.  It was I who inventedthe Great Barbecue, which was made by Aruman as a gift tous, and which feeds our people."    Aragon felt that he ought to have some part in thecoversation. "Why can't the king speak for himself?"    Both Gandalf and Grimey glared at him.  "Because," saidGrimey, "he is busy awating the invention of the television."He indictaed the bare patch of carpet.    "But surely he can speak for himself," said Aragon. "Andwhere is Eonard?"    The king spoke at last, in a deep, weary voice. "He hasbeen grounded, and sent to his room without any supper, forsuggesting that we go to war with our good friend Aruman."    "Friend?!? ARUMAN?!?  What false notions have you putinto your good lord's head about that most villainous ofheadmasters?"    "See, lord, how the wizard comes here to corrupt us? Isay..."  At that moment, Grimey stopped speaking.  Gandalfhad produced a short black stick, white at the ends, fromunder his cloak and was pointing it at Grimey.  He mutteredsomething under his breath, and there was a flash of light.    If Gandalf had had his staff, no doubt the light would havebeen enough to illuminate the hall.  With his wand, however,the flash was as bright as a torch when the batteries arelow.    "Ow!" cried Grimey, clutching at his foot.  He lost hisbalance, tripped over an old can of bitters, and fell,hitting his head on a chair leg and knocking himself outcold.  Giggly curled over with laughter, and Eowynn andLego-lass applauded and cheered.    "Now I may speak to you, Lord HeyHoDen, without theinterference of your slimy little servant.  You must takeheart, for what he has told you is not always the truth.Rise from that chair, and come and look upon your kingdom!"    HeyHoDen stood up, slowly and with great difficulty, thechair groaning as the springs expanded once again."Eonard!" he cried, "come here at once!"    A door opened at the back of the hall and a tall, lankyman emerged, looking sheepishly around.    "Go and fetch my sword from Grimey's chamber.  I am goingoutside!"    "Why do I always have to get the swords?"  Eonard moaned."Can't Eowynn do it?"    "Fetch me my sword, boy!"    "But dad..."    "DO IT!"    "Yes dad... mutter... mumble... mutter..."    "Too long have I listened to the lies of Wormtongue, as Isat in my chair waiting for his television nonsense that hesaid Aruman was working on.  I will look out on my land, andbreathe the free air again."    "I was just going to sugest that," said Gandalf irritably.He strode up to the doors.  "Open. The Lord of the Markcomes forth!"    "Who's Mark?" Lego-lass whispered to Aragon, who shrugged.    The door were slowly pulled open, to reveal a pile, now 7foot high, of Arwen's weapons, with the warrior herself saton top.    "Look out over your land, HeyHoDen.  All is not dark."cried Gandalf.  "Evil broods in the east, but the greatestthreat come from Aruman.  He plans to invade Rohan, fighthis way to Edoras and turn the great hall into a dormitoryfor a new public school."    "Here's your stupid sword, dad," muttered Eonard, joiningthem. "Hairygrim, or whatever you call it."    HeyHoDen ignored him.  "Then we, the people of Rohan, mustcast off the slobishness in which we have lived, and go towar to defend the non-selective comprehensive educationsystem of our fore-fathers!  Fetch me that fool Hammy.  Wemust muster an army and head with all haste to Deem's Help,the great fortress of our people!"  But Hammy appeared tohave vanished.  On closer investigation, it appeared thatevery other soldier in the city had vanished, taking theirhorses with them.  Later, a note was found with Gone toDunharrow.  Back after war has ended scribbled on it.Rohan would go to fight without an army.    The preparations that went on during the day were bothtiring and tiresome.  The team of Dunlending slavesdisassembled the barbecue to carry it with them.  After muchdeliberation, and several particularly cruel ideas fromEonard, who had been grounded many times as a result ofarguing with HeyHoDen, it had been decided that the best thingto do was to lock Grimey in Edoras.  Several hours were wastedwhile Arwen, angry at having missed yet another vital scene,re-secreted her weapons about her personage.  A summoning toarms was sent out, and when that failed Eonard was sent outwith a sharp stick (he wasn't trusted with a sword) to roundup civilains.    So the company that set off to defend Rohan was not anarmy.  It was a rabble.  Due to the sudden dearth of horses,Eowynn had to share horses with Arwen (who was busy thinkingof ways to join the battle without Gandalf noticing), Eonardwith Aragon and HeyHoDen with Gandalf. (The Horse FormerlyKnown As Slimshadë was a strong horse, Aragon mused asthey rode.  Those two men must weigh 70 stone between them.)In front of them they drove hordes of farmers, armed withpitchforks, and smiths, armed with pokers, like pigs to theslaughter.  They had to turn back once, when it was realisedthat Eowynn had forgotten her make-up bag.  But once fourDunlendings had been assigned to carry the enormous bag, theyrode unhindered.    They rode to war.
   Forth they rode from the gates of Medusald.  In the red lightof the setting sun the fields of dandelions appeared to be ablaze.As they rode past the silent graves, Giggly read the inscriptionsaloud.   "'Thengel, and his cat Tiger'."   "'Fengel, and his dog Rex'."   "'Folcwine, with his fish Goldie'."   "'Folca, with his dog Prince'."   "'Walda, and his lizard Bert'."   "'Fluffy, and his dog Brylca'."   "Um, I think you got that one backwards," corrected Lego-lass.   "No, that's what it said," insisted Giggly.  "Let's ask one ofthe locals.  Hey, Eonard!  What can you tell us about King Fluffy?"   "Those were dark days for Rohan," replied Eonard, "of which wedo not speak."   They rode on in silence, into the deepening night.   Slowly, though, a light grew in the west, as if the sun haddecided to make a U-turn after sunset.  Gandalf called Lego-lassforward. "Can you make out the source of that light?" he asked."It's coming from up towards Isengard.  I fear that Aruman isbrewing some new trouble for us."   Lego-lass peered towards the glow on the horizon.  "I don't understand what it is that I'm seeing," she reported, "I can seethe tower of Orthanc silouetted against hundreds of brightlights.  The glare is too great to make out any details, though."   "I must be off!" exclaimed Gandalf.  "HeyHoDen, you'll have toget down and ride with Eonard and Aragon."  At this Eonard andAragon's horse let out a grunt of dismay, but somehow HeyHoDen wasable to scramble onto his back.   As Gandalf rode off in haste, one of the farmers asked thesmith marching beside him what was up.   "'Tis none of our business," said the smith.  "The affairs ofour betters are too high for such as we."     "Humph," snorted the farmer, "I say he's running off as soonas the danger starts, leaving our butts out here on the line.Darn wizards.  They're going to be the first ones against thewall when the revolution comes.  Them and suck-up smiths, thatis."   The horses were getting worn out with two or three riders each, so Aragon and Lego-lass went now with Eonard in the van.  As theinternal combustion engine was not to be invented for another fewmillenia, though, the van had to be pushed by six of the peasants,including one very irate farmer.  "Darn princes and elves are goingto be up against the wall pretty soon after the wizards and smiths."   They decided to turn aside from the Isengard road to take refugein the fortress of Deem's Help, because they felt that this would alsobe a good place to make their stand.  It didn't hurt that Erkenbrand,the commander of the Hornburg, was known to stock the best winecellar north of Gondor.  Deem's Help was a narrow canyon cut backinto the mountains.  A wall stretched across the mouth of the canyon,at one end of which stood the fortress known as the Hornburg.  It wasnamed after the great jazz bands of old. In the days when Deem himselflived in the fortress, they would have open-air concerts in the canyon,and the surrounding hills acted as a natural ampitheater.  Even todaya trumpet blast from the walls of the Hornburg would make the hillsring with the sound of music. Julie Andrews herself could do nobetter.   "Who goes there?" came the challenge from above the gate intothe Help.  "Does the Golden Hall send any aid in our time of need?Oh, it's just you, Eonard.  Can't be helped I suppose.  Who's thatyou brought with you, then?"   "Do you not recognize your lord and master?  Come forth andkneel before King HeyHoDen!"  came the response from Eonard.   "My liege!" grovelled the guard.  "We had feared that . . ."   "That I was hidden in Meduseld, beguiled by the lies of atraitor?" finished HeyHoDen.   "Well, not that exactly.  Mainly we just thought you were too lazyto get off your fat butt and ride all the way out here.  The wordin the outer provinces is that you've turned into a total couchpotato."  Then, turning back to the guard tower, he cried out "Openthe gates!  Your King is here!"   Glad cries of "Hey! Ho!" arose from the walls.  The king of theMark rode through the open gates, flanked by his sister-son andsister-daughter, not to mention his brother-neighbor-cousin-dog--groomer-lover-aunt-husband-nephew-friend, and several otherrelations of even greater removal.  Aragon, Giggly, Lego-lass and Arwen were left milling around with various smiths and farmersoutside the walls.   "This is more like it," chuckled Giggly, looking around at thecliffs. "No more forests and plains for me.  This country has goodbones.  The sinews are only so-so, but the bones are really good."   "How do you feel about the cartilige?" asked Lego-lass.   "Not as good as the bones, but definitely first rate."   "Stop your dawdling," ordered Aragon, "we have to prepare.  Evennow the forces of Aruman approach."   They could see an ominous glow coming up the valley, sillouettingthe orc-forms coming before it.  Luckily they were able to set up thebarbecue and have dinner before the hoard of orcs approached the gates.  Before they were done clearing the dishes, though, the enemyranks filled the valley.  The shouts of the prefects rose above the general confusion.   "50 house points for the first one through the gates!"   "Move that battering ram into place!"   "Fight for the honor of house and school!"   "No more non-selective comprehensive education!"   "Kill the commoners!"   "Halt!"  shouted Aragon from the wall.  A strange silence settledover the orc horde as they stopped to listen to his words.  "They saythe Hornburg has never fallen when a rabble of farmers and smiths hasstood to defend it.  Turn back now and you will be allowed to live."   He was answered with derisive laughter.  "We are the Uruk-HaiPrefects! We fear no man, be he farmer or smith!"  Aragon jumped backas a rain of arrows flew toward his position, and the battle was begun.The defenders of the Hornburg and of the wall across the Help weresorely pressed.  Lego-lass and Giggly found themselves beset by foeswho had gained the top of the wall.   "How do you fare?" grunted Giggly as he ducked under a swingingsword.   "Not so bad.  There's six!" Lego-lass counted as she pulled herdagger from the corpse of a falling orc.   "I've killed eight,"  returned Giggly, bringing his battle-axe downon another foe.  "Make that nine."   Suddenly there was a lull, as the top of the wall was free of orcsfor the moment.  "I say," mused Lego-lass, pulling out her bow andfiring off a couple of arrows at the army below, "have you ever really thought about it?  There's eight, by the way."   "Thought about what?" asked Giggly.   "Well, doesn't it seem a bit, well (nine), wrong, to you?  We just assume (ten) that all orcs are our foes (eleven) because of theirancestry?"   "Here they come again!" shouted Giggly as a group of orcs cameup a ladder.  He ran to the point where they overtopped the wall,axe swinging.  "Now that you put it that way, (ten) it does seema little odd (eleven).  One would have hoped that by the end of theThird Age we'd be beyond such race-based thinking (twelve and thirteen)."  As the headless body fell at his feet he turned back to Lego-lass.   "Exactly (twelve)!" came back Lego-lass, firing arrows as fast asshe could put notch to bowstring.  "There's thirteen, we're tied!  Anyway, look at us (fourteen, I'm winning!).  As elf-maid and dwerrow,we should hate each other, but our budding relationship provesthe opposite."   "You've given me much to think on, fair Lego-lass.  Perhaps thisanti-orc prejudice of ours is unwarranted, and we should seek toreform rather than kill them.  By the way, as you were speaking I gotsix more.  My count is up to nineteen.  Hey Arwen!" he shouted to theleather-clad elf who was approaching, "My count is nineteen, and Lego-lass is at fourteen. ["It's sixteen now, dear"]  How does the battlefare for you?"   "I've killed three-hundred and seventy-two.  I'd like to see themleave THAT out of the movie," replied Arwen.     The fighting ran on late into the night.  Epic songs have been sungof the brave deeds of farmer and smith in defense of their king andcountry.  In the morning light the rabble of Rohan prepared for onelast push.  Even HeyHoDen put on his armor and stood in the firstcompany with Aragon, Lego-lass, and Arwen.  Eonard was skulking around, complaining to anyone who would listen about Aragon gettingtop billing.  Eowyn was sent to her room, told that women weren't allowedto fight.  "What about Arwen and Lego-lass?" she whined.  "They're elves,it's different," came the reply.  Giggly had disappeared during the night.  It was rumored that he'd retreated to the caves with a bandof smiths.  HeyHoDen addressed the troops.   "Today, men, is a good day to die . . . "   "Bummer of a pep-talk, pops!" came a voice from the back of the crowd.   "Quiet!  As I was saying, today is a good day to die.  That's why Iwant my sister-son Eonard to lead the first charge.  The rest of us willfollow anon. We fight, my friends, for our way of life.  We fight for theright of all men to send their children to good schools, that they maylearn to read the tales of our battle today.  The enemy wants toreserve that right for only the upper classes who can afford theirfancy schools  . . . "   "Hey, didn't you send your son to . . . " interrupted the voice fromthe back of the crowd.   "Someone shut that guy up!" HeyHoDen cut him off.  "This is yourdestiny, men.  We ride forth into glory!  We ride forth into history!Hey!  Ho!"   The battle cry of Rohan was taken up by the crowd.  Shouts of "Hey!"and "Ho!" rang out as the gates of the Hornburg were thrown open with ablast of trumpets and they surged out to meet . . . nothing.  Where theorc armies had been encamped there was a strange forest of poles ofdiffering shapes and heights (now darkened).  Not an orc was to be seen.Just then Gandalf rode up on Slimshade.   "Where've you been?" asked Aragon.   "Oh, you know, out and about, looking for the army.  They assured methey'd be along sometime later today.  They have to all get their uniformsback from the cleaners and should be along after having a nice brunch andmaybe playing a round of golf.  How'd it go here, then?"   "Damned wizards and soldiers," muttered a certain farmer in the backof the crowd, "always gone in the midst of trouble.  They'll be up againstthe wall when the revolution comes, to be sure."   The revolution would not come today, though.  Today the King of Rohanrode triumphant from the field of battle.
   So it was that the two grossly obese men, Gandalf and HeyHoDen,met again.  The hicks of Rohan stared in wonder at the poles that nowdotted the field before the Hornburg, but their attention was broken byGiggly, who strode out of the canyon behind the Hornburg, gigglingfuriously.  He was accompanied by the smiths and Gambler the Old.   "Forty-two, Miss Lego-lass!" he shouted triumpantly, as he walked toher side.   "Hmm," she mused, "I only managed to finish off forty-one."   "Damn that Arwen,"  Giggly said.  "She's got us both beat."   "Yes," replied Lego-lass.  "We're going to have to get her writtenout of the movie, or she'll end up overshadowing us both.  I'm supposedto be the token elf-babe after all, not her!" she finished with a stampof her foot.   Meanwhile, everyone turned back to the poles.  They squinted atthem, as if they were an illusion or something, but the polesremained.  Then they started to look at Gandalf suspiciously.   "Don't look at me like that," Gandalf said.  "I had nothing to dowith the poles.  It's better than what I had planned anyway, so stopcomplaining."   "Then is this the work of Aruman?"  HeyHoDen asked.  "Did he putthese poles here to trap us so his orcs can get free run of my kingdom?"   "Nope," said Gandalf.  "It's a power far older than Aruman himself:            The forest has its lamps so bright,            What could make that shining light?"   "What's that supposed to mean?" grumbled HeyHoDen.   "If you want to find out," said Gandalf, "then you'll have to comewith me to Isengard."   However, the men of Rohan decided right there to have a celebrationbarbecue, delaying their departure for the rest of the day.  Gandalffumed for a while and chain-smoked several pouches of pipe-weed, butthen he took Aragon aside so they could discuss their plans.  Theytalked in Auld High Elvish, so that no one else would be able tounderstand what they were saying (well, except for Arwen, but shealready knew the plan anyway.)   "Once we deal with Aruman, our plan for world domination will beunstoppable," said Gandalf.  "The elves are tired of Middle-earth, andwill let you do whatever you want.  The dwerrows should be fairly easyto exploit once you take over.  Old Denethor is senile and crazy,so he won't be a problem, and Dr Faramir is loyal to us.  We're almostfinished with Aruman, so he won't be a problem, either."   "Speaking of which," said Aragon, "where did those orcs really comefrom?  I can't believe Aruman would attack Rohan and risk losing allthe money he's making off them."   "Oh, they're Aruman's alright,"  Gandalf replied.  "They were busyvandalizing Fungang, but I convinced them to attack Rohan on a dareright after I took care of that Balrog. I even had a bunch of helmetsmade up to implicate Aruman, but the stupid smith thought Isaid 'Saruman' and put S-runes on the helms instead of A."   "I was wondering about that myself,"  said Aragon.   "All that leaves is the Shire," continued Gandalf.  "As long as hehas the Ring, Frodo could get in our way, but luckily for us, hedoesn't know how it really works.  He was too busy trying to bag thatTook wench to learn its real powers.  Once he destroys that damnableRing, he'll eliminate both it and Sauron for us.  While he's busy doingthat, we'll liquidate what assets he has left. When we're done withhim, there won't be any place left in Middle-earth for him.  The restof the Shire is ripe for a revolution, thanks to all that time I spentthere over years planting the seeds of revolt.  Once they havetheir 'freedom', you'll be able to secretly control them through theBrandybuck crime syndicate."   The men of Rohan had their barbecue, and lounged around for the restof the afternoon.  Their Dunlending slaves didn't get any rest,though.  First they had to cook the food and serve it.  Then they hadto clean up, and then take down the portable grills.  Needless to say,by the end of the afternoon, they had gotten pretty pissed.   Finally HeyHoDen's curiosity about the poles overcame his laziness,and he gathered his host to set out for Isengard.  There had beencausalties in the battle, which left extra horses, and now no one hadto share horses except for Giggly and Lego-lass.   They folowed Gandalfthrough the poles.   "These poles are strange," said Lego-lass.  "I'd like to find outwhat they are."   "No way, said Giggly.  "It feels like they hate us, and want to killus."   "Not all of us, silly," she said, "just the orcs.  Maybe these polescome from Fungang."   "Well, you're a tree-hugging elf, so I guess you think Fungang iswonderful," said Giggly.  "But I have seen something even better.   "Humans can be so stupid, Lego-lass.  Here they have a naturalwonder, and what do they do with it?  Caves, they say!  Holes toamplify that horrible music from their concerts.  Lego-lass, do youknow that the cave's of Deem's Help are vastly amusing?  I know manydwerrows who would pay pure gold, just to see them and laugh."   "And I would pay double, just to be let out," she snorted, knowingsome of the stupid things Giggly would laugh at.   "Shows what you know," said Giggly.  "I know I laugh a lot, but thesecaves really are funny.  The stalactites, and columns, and everythingelse made me laugh.  And it wasn't just me.  Gambler was laughing hisass off too.  It was pretty dark when we were in there.  I can onlyimagine how funny it would be all lit up.  Just think, cavern aftercavern of funny shapes, deep into the mountain."   "Maybe the Men of Rohan are smart to conceal them," said theelf.  "Just think what damage a single family of dwerrows with hammersand chisels would do to them."   "Spoken like a true elf," said Giggly  "You think that the dwerrowshave no economic sense whatsoever.  But we can recognize a profit whenwe see one, and exploit it.  Hell, we need the revenue, thanks to theelves and Gondor taking advantage of us for centuries.  I couldmake this into a tourist destination: the Giggling Caves of Aglarond, atheme park to rival the Magic Kingdom of Gondor!"   "You move me, Gimli," said Lego-lass.  "Never before have I heard adwerrow actually come up with a sound financial scheme.  But where areyou going to get the money to run your little enterprise?  Everyoneknows the dwerrows are broke.  Let's make a deal -- if you visitFungang with me when all this is over, I'll lend you the money to startup the business, and then we can share the profits."   "Well, I suppose if I have to visit that stupid forest I will," saidGimli.  "But only if you promise to help me with the caves."   "I promise, I promise," said Lego-lass quickly, crossing her fingersbehind her back.  But then some thoughts came unbidden to hermind.  Come to think of it, I won't even have to shell out any of myown money to help him, she thought.  I can just get the money fromDaddy, and if his plan fails, I won't lose anything.  But if hesucceeds, then I get my cut of the money.  But I am definitely notfalling in love with him.   The company rode past the last poles, and headed toward the highwaywhich lead to Isengard.  Lego-lass looked back, and then exclaimed,"Look!  The poles are lighting up!"  Then she turned her horse around,and galloped back toward the poles.  "Ooh, the pretty colors," she said.Giggly was busy having another lauging fit.   "Stop, Lego-lass Greenbutt!"  shouted Gandalf.   "I'd listen to him if I were you," said a strange deep voice with ametallic undertone.  "Those poles are all charged up."  It came from acreature that looked like a walking pole with arms and a bright halogenglare.  He pointed to a large squat box that read in big letters:                        High Voltage                      Do Not Touch Ever                 Especially in ThunderstormsThen more of the same creatures strode out from the poles, with allsorts of different colored lights, bright reds, soft greens, glaringsodium yellows, and neon pinks.  Some actually laughed at the elf,while most of the others walked from pole to pole, checking them. Criesof fear came from the smiths and farmers, and they tightly clutchedtheir pitchforks and pokers.   "Stop!" shouted Gandalf.  "Put your weapons away.  They aren'tenemies, and in fact aren't concerned with you at all."   "Well, what are they, Gandalf?" grumbled HeyHoDen, hoping that thesecreatures did not like barbecue, for it seemed to him like they couldeat a great deal.  "Can't you give us a straight answer for once insteadof all these stupid riddles?"   "Riddles?" asked Gandalf.  "Has your brain become as soft as yourbackside?  Any five-year old could tell you what they are.  You haveseen Ments, HeyHoDen, Ments of Fungang Forest, which you call theMentwood.  Really, how the hell do you think it got that name in thefirst place?"   Before HeyHoDen could answer, Gandalf rode off, and they had littlechoice but to follow him.  Finally they came to the Fords of Isen.This was a wide plain with a hard black ground, where many Fords wereparked.  There were all sorts of makes and models; Model-Ts, Mustangs,even a few scruffy-looking Edsels.  "We wasted enough time barbecuingback at Deem's Help," grumbled Gandalf.  "Everyone get in a Ford, andwe'll drive the rest of the way."  HeyHoDen, Eonard, and Aragon tradedtheir horses for a Mustang, Arwen got in a Model-T, and the others gotin the remaining Fords.  The farmer that had complained so much back atDeem's Help had straggled behind, though, and all that was left for himwas a beat-up old Pinto.   Once upon a time, the men of Atlantis built Isengard at the southend of the Musty Mountains.  However, as the centuries passed, itgenerated no tourist income, and so Gondor sold the property (atwhich time it lost its trademark).  It passed from the hands of onedisreputable owner to another, until finally Aruman came to dwellthere.  He had just recovered from his centuries-long bout ofalcoholism, and decided to make up for his seedy past by doing charitywork.   He had planned to found an orphanage and school for disadvantaged orcboys.  He tore up all the weeds that had choked the grounds for amillenia or so, and planted grass and trees, forming what he hopedwould be a calming environment and thus lessen the homocidal tendanciesinborn in orcs. He failed.  The older boys set up a nasty system ofhazing for the younger boys that actually made things worse.   Eventually Aruman gave up his original plans, and decided to breakthe boys' spirits by using them as child labor.  The serene, almostpastoral landscape of the Wizard's Vale gave way to dormitories andfactories.  All that remained the same within the circle of Isengardwas the tower of Eyesore, the ugliest outcrop of rock in Middle-earth,and the chief cause of Isengard's economic decline.  There the menof Atlantis carved a tower out of the rock, but no one wanted to becaught living there.  Aruman, during his days of recovery, thought thehumiliation would be good for him, after his centuries of dissoluteliving.  Later, he hoped the ugliness of his attempts atindustrialization would make the ugliness of Eyesore less noticeable.   Now Gandalf and the others drove up to the gates of Isengard.  Oncethere were lagre iron gates here, but they had been hurled to theground and crumpled like an aluminum can.  There were large gaps in thewalls, as if something, or rather, a large number of somethings, hadmelted their way through.   Inside, Isengard was filled with bubbling,boiling water.  However, Eyesore stood untouched in the center, as uglyas always.  HeyHoDen and his company sat in the Fords, speechless.They saw that Aruman's School for Boys was no more.  "Damn," thoughHeyHoDen, "so much for television."  Then as he looked away, he noticedtwo small figures sitting next to a large pile of dirty dishes on anoutcrop of melted rock, now cooled.   The company got out of their Fords, and walked up to the figures.One was sleeping, and snoring quite loudly, the other was awake andsmoking, with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.  "Welcome to Isengard," hesaid.  "I am Moribund, of a quite unimportant family.  My companion,"he paused here, firmly kicking the sleeping figure in the ribs with hissteel-toed boots, "is Paragraph Took, son of Palatine, of the house ofTook.  Aruman is busy, so he can't be bothered to see you right now.You'll have to make an appointment."   "Indeed," answered Gandalf.  "Aruman must be getting really cheapif he can't affort better doormen than two ill-mannered louts."   Morrie ignored Gandalf's insult, deciding to pay him backlater.  "Aruman's not in charge anymore.  Isengard's under newmanagement.  Our orders came from Steelbeard."   Giggly couldn't help it any longer.  He burst into laughter.  Afterabout a minute or so, when he was finally able to talk, he said, "Wow,Morrie, I never thought you could be such a joker!"   Before Morrie could retort, HeyHoDen and the others burst intolaughter.  "I take it you know these, uh, men, Gandalf?" HeyHoDenasked.  "Since we've already seen Ments, I'm guessing these are thefabled Halflings?  Little is said about them in Rohan, just that theydwell in a bunch of shacks, and nothing at all about them blowing smokeout of their mouths."   "Really?" said Morrie.  "The weed-trade of Beltbuckleland andBongbottom in the Southfarthing is very profitable, and has been eversince we, ah, acquired the rights to it from Tobold Hornblower.  I'msurprised that no one knows about it."   "That's because of Gondor," said Gandalf.  "They banned weedcenturies ago, when they cleaned up Gondor to make it more family-friendly."   Morrie's jaw began to drop, but then widened into a broad smile as herealized the profit potential of what could be a huge new market in thesouth.  He drew a small pouch out of his pocket.  "Here's a smallsample of weed, my lord," he said.  "If you like it, I can get more foryou, but you'll have to pay for it."   "You do not know your danger, HeyHoDen," interrupted Gandalf.  "TheBrandybucks lace their weed with a substance that makes it highlyaddictive, which ensures that their customers always come back formore.  I should know, since I learned that the hard way," he said,lighting up another pouch of pipe-weed.  Morrie glared angrily at him,but Gandalf ignored him and went on.  "I don't have the time to see youget hooked on a new bad habit right now.  I must speak to Steelbeard.When we're done here, you can talk to Morrie about weed if you want.It's actually quite enjoyable, but first things first."  Morrie decidedthat he didn't need to kill Gandalf after all.   Then Gandalf, HeyHoDen, and the other Rohirrim rode into Isengard tolook for the elder Ment.  Morrie turned to Pipsqueak and whispered,"We're going to make a fortune."
        "Sheesh!" muttered Aragon.  "Why am I stuck here with theselosers when I should be off with the movers and shakers?  Gandalf willpay for this insult!"  Fortunately no one (except Arwen -- and possiblyMorrie, the cat-eared, but he gave no sign) could hear him overGiggly's merriment.        "Where the hell were you guys anyway?" the Dwerrow barelymanaged to enunciate.  "And how did you end up here of all Eru-forsakenplaces, gorging yourselves on pâté à foie gras and tripping!Tripping!  Where did you get the drugs, hosses?  This is so hil... HA!HA! HA! HA!"  Giggly collapsed into hysterics.        "Bongbottom weed, too," observed Aragon, cheering up alittle.  "Pretty valuable stuff  very pure."        "When are you going to kick the habit?" sighed Arwen.        "What I want to know is where they got the wine," said Lego-lass.  "I thought Aruman had outlawed it.  This is supposedly a school,not a saloon, no?"        "What's it to you where we found it?" said Morrie.  "It's here;what's it worth to you?"        Giggly and Aragon bargained hard, but Morrie ended up pocketinga lot of flokarinos.  No one ever got around Morrie the Mean Dude --or at least it was a long walk, especially with the decline of publictransit in the Third Age from the Dark Years when Sauron and Miniwethilmade the Eagles come on time.  But I digress.        Having gobbled their bouillabaisse with cilantro à lanoldoroise with almost indecent haste, the companions sat around for awhile and got stoned.  Aragon lay back and sniffed the white stuff likethere was no tomorrow.        "Look!" squealed Pipsqueak, "Strider the Cokehead is back!"        "I've been back, you bleating idiot!" retorted Aragon.  "Icould have been with the important people -- but nooo!"        "Have some morphine," said Morrie soothingly.  "It'll make youfeel much better."        "Are we going to spend ALL DAY GETTING STONED?" yelled Lego-lass after a couple hours of groovin'.  "What about ANSWERING Giggly'sQUESTION?"        "Well, I woke up to find myself tied up and being lugged aroundby a bunch of nasty snobbish public school brats.  Someone had tied theknots awfully tight, too," said Pipsqueak, glaring at Morrie, who hadan expression of such wide-eyed innocence that Pipsqueak might havebeen accusing him of giving alms to hobbit-orphans (but under the tablehe gave him the special kick that meant "Drop it, unless you want toknow what a Bywater grin feels like).  "The less said about theinitiation rites the better," continued Pipsqueak.  "Let's just saythey put the zing in hazing, and leave it at that."        Pipsqueak went on to give a précis of III.1, which you can readfor yourselves, as I have no intention whatsoever of recapping it; but heleft to Morrie the invidious task of describing the horror of Clarénce,his disgusting pawing, his liquor-laden breath, his insidious cheatingat cricket, his irritating uppah-clawss ahccent, his abominable violinpracticing, and his annoying habit of singing "If I had the Ring of theMaster".  Morrie, true to form, refused to say a word about it, otherthan, "Mordor-Orcs ain't Mother Teresa."        "The educational system in Mordor is a horrible abyss of evil,"intoned Aragon.  "Instead of just teaching the three R's and vocationaled -- the only stuff the lower orders really need to know -- they havethis accursed arts education cruddola.  Frills, I call it."  His eyeswere glazed with horror at the thought, or else mayhap he was onlysuffering a really bad trip.  "I only hope Aruman's school wasn't toocorrupted by that long-haired stuff.  It looks like Sauron and Arumanmust have been allied somehow."  He took another draw. An act was thisfraught with consequences.        Morrie looked at the Ranger contemptuously, but did not tellhim that the Brandibuck mafia had known about the Sauron-Arumanalliance for years, as it had really eaten into their profits.Instead, he abruptly changed the topic.  "Now we're coming to a part ofthe story you don't know anything about. The Ments ..."        "Oh, can I tell them?  Please let me tell it!  PLEASE!"squealed Pipsqueak.  Morrie gave in, only cautioning Pipiqueak notto "spill too much."  Pipsqueak had the sense therefore not to sayanything about Morrie's motives in coming to Isengard in the firstplace (the less outsiders knew about the weed trade, the better; noneed for Aragon to worry about Lotho and all that business -- theBrandibucks could handle it much more effectively).  Nevertheless, hemanaged to swell Book III, Chapter IV to three or four times itsoriginal size, not forgetting to lay great stress on Steelbeard'sresemblance to the Terminator in the celebrated mummers'play, Terminator II.        "I have to admit I had trouble buying Steel's story of thesinging Lion," concluded Pipsqueak.  "Especially the baritone part."        "It's the truth," said Arwen. "He used to appear now and thenduring the Second Age, or so my father told me.  He had a better voicethan Bing Krozbi.  I saw him once as a girl; but he muttered somethingabout this world being rather a waste anyway, and hasn't been seensince."        "Your meriniscences are reeeeeeeally sexy," drawled Aragon,flyin' hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.        "Anyway," said Pipsqueak, deciding he hadn't concluded afterall, "we went on this forced march to Isengard, and the Ments wererapping so loud, we had to stick our twinkies in our ears to avoidbeing deafened.  While this was going on, we passed a bunch of Fords.There was also a sign, where it was written, 'From Sauron to Aruman.Here are those cars you wanted.  Now start enacting democratic reformsand eliminating labor abuses ... and I mean now!!!'"        Aragon frowned at the words "democratic" and "labor."        "Next to them were some opera CDs by a guy named Gaetano ..."        "What's that?" said Arwen.        "Oh Eeeeeeeeeeeeeru ... You don't want to know!" zombed Aragon,moved perhaps by some memory or, more likely, hallucination about histrips to the East.  In after years, by the way, he was known as ElLesser the Tasteless.        "... Metríc, labelled 'Try it, you'll like it!'"  continuedPipsqueak.  "Steelbeard burned down the sign and smashed the CDs,muttering something about the decline of civilization since the FirstAge.        "Nearly forgot to mention that the entire forest of lamppostswas following us by now. Creepy, like something out of a bad sciencefiction mummer's play.  It was the Scruporns, as the Ments call themin 'rude language.'  Steel won't say much about them, but it seems alot of the lampposts malfunctioned after sleeping with Jadis Joplin theScreecher, the White Witch.  Their descendants were born with nastybirth defects, and have the intellectual capacity of an intelligenttoaster, but can still deal out a shock to write home about."        "Steel came and broke down the gates," interposed Moribund,more in order to maintain a simulacrum of variety than because hereally felt like talking. "They looked strong, but Steel and the Mentsmelted them with their woozy-like eyes as if they were made of cheapcardboard.   It seems to me Aruman's pretty wimpy stuff if he's soeasily beaten by a bunch of lampposts out of a really bad cartoon.What's the big deal all about, anyway?  Aruman, Schmaruman, I saying."        "Aruman's smarter than you think," said Aragon.  "He alwaysused to beat Gandalf at Othello like nobody's business.  I didn't tellyou about that at the wake, 'cuz I was too doped and boozed up toremember it.  Moreover, he had a mean PR machine.  Gandalf says Arumanused to make some naaaaasty moonshine, until he quit and startedgetting into that boring charity work stuff instead.  It's almost arelief that he turned his pupils into child labor; at least it showshe's related to Gandalf after all."        "Well, anyway," said Paragraph (so named because he talked inparagraphs instead of sentences), "we saw a bunch of Orcs up to somekind of mischief, yelling things like, 'Amo, amas, I love a lass.'  TheMents tried to kill them, but a mysterious and very fat figure appearedand raised a forcefield, before leading them away.  We don't know whoit was; not Aruman. I think it was ..." Morrie kicked him and hechanged the subject.  "The Ments made a bonfire like the Sun was nevergoing to shine again.  That pyromaniac Steelbeard was having a grandold time.  'Hoom, HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!  This is fun, by the Lion'sMane!' he boomed.  The entire school was demolished, the textbooksburned -- especially the Latin ones..."        "Latin heraus!" yelled Aragon.  Morrie looked at him withannoyance, and wondered whether he should stick to his plan of usingAragon as a puppet, or just get rid of him as soon as Sauron and theother nuisances were overcome.  While he pondered this, Pipsqueak'sinterminable squealing continued.        "Well, anyway," said Pipsqueak rather repetitively, "Aruman'sforces figured out pretty fast the way things were turning, andbolted.  The Ments let most of the Men go, figuring they were probablya typo for Ments; Steel only demanded a few flokarinos from each Man. Idon't think any Orcs survived -- other than the ones that left earlier;they were all massacred."        "Serve 'em right!" said Aragon.  "They're lesser breeds withoutthe law, and must perish.  Natural selection.  Orcs heraus!"        "I dunno," said Lego-lass.  "Giggly and I were wondering aboutthat.  Don't you think it's wrong to wipe 'em out?  Shouldn't we beeducating them about the sanctity of the Market instead?"        "Wrong, but fun; kind of like adultery."  Giggly exploded intoguffaws.  Lego-lass glared at him.        "What is you, a goblin-lover?" sneered Aragon, ignoringGiggly.  "So typical of someone who thinks Balrogs ..." The expressionon Lego-lass's face silenced the Ranger, coupled with the fact that heneeded more cocaine.        "Aruman made a run from one of the burning buildings, takingswigs from a bottle as he ran," was not silent Paragraph. "The Mentsran after them, but then he pointed away and yelled 'There's a bird!'While the Ments looked away, he made a beeline for Eyesore (it deservedits name: it was yoooow-GLEE!) and holed himself in.  There he got hisprecious computers to work, disturbing the Ments' mechanisms with JavaScript errors, The Page Cannot Be Displayed Nyah nyah nyah! messagesand other horrors.  Worst of all was the onslaught of emoticons. Helaughed sarcastically.        "I thought the Ments were mad before, but that was nothing.Have you seen the mummers' play, The Towering Inferno?  That's whatit was like.  That, and a really bad fight scene in one of the StarWars mummers' plays, as Steelbeard and Co. wielded their internallightsabres and expelled some mean photon torpedoes out of variouscavities.  I was scared.  Luckily, Morrie always brings asbestos suitswherever he goes-"        "Like they really needed to know that," grumbled Morrie.        "And then Steel suddenly called the other Ments together overhis PA system.  I think he'd already thought up a plan of his own in hissuperior artificial intelligence system, or maybe he just needed torefuel. Anyway, while they were doing what they do best, Gandalfsuddenly showed up.  I... er... well, keep this private please, because Iprobably shouldn't tell you it, but my vocal chords have rather a mindof their own, and don't know how to stop-"        "You can say that again," muttered Morrie, which Pipsqueakpromptly did before continuing.        "Well, I was kind of not happy to see the codger back, to tellthe truth.  I nearly spilt my latte in my chagrin, but I managed to gaspout, 'Gandalf!  I was hop... er... I thought you were dead!"        "'The feeling is mutual, you pitiful little rodent half-breed,"hissed Gandalf, before kind of half-laughing to make me think it was ajoke. 'Where in the name of instant messaging is Steelbeard?  I need totalk to him pronto!'"  I pointed the way to a building (one of the fewleft standing) marked 'Maintenance Workers Only.'  He came out havingsome kind of altercation with Steel; I caught the words 'I can breakyou,' but not much else, as I was tripping on peyote at the time.        "When I came down, I saw that the Scruporns had plantedthemselves all over the schoolyard.  It wasn't an appropriate place forOrc-children to hang out, I'm here to tell you.  Morrie and I lookedaround for eats.  We nabbed a bunch of rabbits; they were horriblycute, and begged us not to kill them.  'I'm Fwopsy,' said one.  'I'mMopsy,' said the second one.  'I'm Cottontail,' said the third.  'I'mMichael Jackson,' said the fourth.  I wanted to spare them, but Morriecan be brutal when necessary. He called me an incurable romantic!  Wefound a lot of other good stuff, too.  Morrie has a nose."  Pipsqueakwas on a roll, and there was no stopping him now, for Morrie was stilllost in plans for world domination and kneecapping his enemies, and waspaying no attention to the stream of blather that issued forth fromPipsqueak's mouth like unto a rushing torrent of squeaks.  "We foundAruman's cabinet, the one marked "Top Secret.  Don't Let Sauron orMiniwehtil See Contents."        "Who's Miniwethil?" asked Giggly.  "And if it was so topsecret, why wasn't it in Eyesore?"        "It wasn't in Eyesore because Miniwethil was," explainedPipsqueak.  "And Miniwethil was some rodent broad Aruman hung out with.She had chîchiz like succulent peaches! Last I saw, Steel wasdragging her somewhere and she was screaming.  I'm guessing she came toa bad end."         "She was for long Sauron's mistress -- she was quite thevamp," said Arwen.  "I never understood what the big deal was; didpeople get turned on by those mouse-ears? I fought her with namuchakusonce. During the First and Second Ages she and Sauron wrought muchevil, like the forty-hour work week, free ballet and sung mummers'plays, and sex education. At the end of the Second Age they had afalling out."        "Rumor has it that she tried to bobbitt the Dark Lord, but bitoff the wrong portion of his anatomy," said Aragon, coming out of hismorphine-induced stupor. "Then she transferred her attentions toIsildur, and together they conceived Anarchion the SartoriallyChallenged Waterfowl.  After Isildur met his untimely end at thehands of Black Pete (leading to the Gondorians' famous Racism), shemoved in with Aruman.  Meanwhile Anarchion begat-" Arwen quicklycovered Aragon's mouth, as she always did whenever he uttered theword "begat."        "Enough amusing -- or not so amusing -- narrativeirrelevancies," she muttered.  "They eat up too many damn kilobytes."        "Next time we saw Steel, he seemed kind of ticked off," saidMorrie.  "'You didn't give me a lot of info earlier,' he grumbled.'Didn't you trust me?'  He seemed kind of hurt when I told him 'No.'Like it says on the Brandibuck coat of arms, 'Don't trust nobody butyour crowbar.'  'Then what the Angband use are you losers?' he whined.He gave me a mild electric shock.  When my crime syndicate takes over,he'll wish he hadn't."        By now Pipsqueak had, unfortunately, woken up.  The torrentrecommenced.  The others zoned out on drugs; it was the only way theycould survive Pipsqueak's incessant bleating.  At least the blatherersat El Rond's Council had mostly had pleasant baritones.  Even Gigglyhad given up waiting for the punchline.   "Gandalf turned up again andtold us a bit about Frodo and Sam.  But we were more concerned with youguys..."        "After all," put in Morrie, "that estate in Mordor is all verywell and good (or would be if they didn't have so much damnedregulation in Mordor).  But the United Kingdom means a Global Market,and that means..." He rubbed his fingers together in the ancient hobbitgesture for what, in Elvish, is called mucha múla.        "Suddenly we smelt fumes of a mysterious substance that Steelcalled gasolinorpetrolbenzinorwhateverdahellyawannakallit," continuedPipsqueak.  "A slimy, malodorous liquid flooded Isengard.  It was likebubbling, boiling water with a bad case of halitosis. 'They want toeliminate Aruman by destroying his habitat; pretty clever,' as oldMorrie explained. The Scruporns meanwhile filled everything with anunbearable red light.   Steel and whatnot burned the gaso... stuff andcaused nasty exhalations of some flaming substance or other..."        At the word "flaming," Aragon woke up and lit a cigarettebefore remarking, "Yeah, we saw that. We thought Aruman was dreaming upsome new devilry, or else that he'd developed a wicked new form of weed."        "Not he!" bleated Pipsqueak.  "He was probably choking and notlaughing anymore.  We managed to hole ourselves in this tower with thecabinet with lots of cool secret stuff..."  Morrie twirled his walkingstick idly. Pipsqueak took the hint and changed the topic.  "Today waspretty much a drag.  Nothing left to eat but pâté à foie gras and otherhaute cuisine, no news, no Ments... they were all at a party and wouldn'tlet us come.  'No rat-folk allowed,' as Steel put it.  Instead we hadto wait at the gate for HeyHoDen and whatnot."        "Worth the wait, though," said Moribund.  "We've got vast newmarkets just waiting to be opened up."        "True," said Paragraph.  "Oh, I almost forgot to mention thisguy named Grimey..."        "No!" said Aragon, in a voice full of what he meant to soundlike majesty, although he gave more the impression of an overgrownspoiled brat.  "I will not listen to any more of your world-without-endsquealing. I do not want to know how Grimey came, nor what evil plotshe's been hatching with Aruman.  I do not even want to know how he gotout of Edoras, where he was locked last I knew.  I only want to knowone thing, and after that you are to shut up.  How much, in the name ofSteamboat Willie, are you willing to give for those silver beltthings?"  Giggly chortled at the recollection of how the belts chimedthe Happy Birthday song when Aragon picked them up.        Morrie, after calmly and efficiently gagging Pipsqueak, saidnonchalantly, "It would be a pity if your drug supplies dried up."        Aragon groaned and forked over the belts, while Arwen sighed.
     The companions lay at their ease for some time, trying to unblurtheir vision and occasionally throttling Pipsqueak to prevent him fromtalking any more. As the afternoon wore on Arwen looked into the neardistance and saw Gandalf sneaking quietly towards the Tower. "Something'sup," she said in a hushed whisper, checking her slipknives. "Come on. We'dbetter see what he's up to."     Quickly the companions arose, and began the trek towards the wizard.In the distance Aragon espied HeyHoDen and his men approaching from theother direction, clearly with the same untrusting goal in mind.     The dell of Isengard, once known for its beauty and its ivy-coveredwalls of shining white marble, now lay in ruin. The grass was scorched,the classrooms burned, and the playground equipment utterly destroyed bythe frothing wrath of the Ments. Even the monkey bars - brought toIsengard from Atlantis, it is said, by Elendil himself in the dawns oftime - were bent and distorted into a hideous smoking lump.     Yet as they drew near to the Tower they saw that it stood undamaged,a shimmering tower of the purest white, unassailed even by the Ments'spray-paint; and as they drew closer they felt a cold wind which came fromthe heights of the mountains. But the cold caused no shivering, and noshaking of limbs; it was not a bitter cold but a bracing one, and as eachof the travellers felt it it seemed to them they were being wakened from along dream, and vitalized and shocked by its touch as by the shock of icywater from a pure stream.     I have been a fool! Pipsqueak thought, with a sudden sense ofrevelation. This is all wrong. I should have stayed at home. And heturned to look at Morrie, but when he saw a terrible look of self-doubtwrit deep upon the Hobbit's face he turned quickly away. He saw Giggly andLego-lass, acting on some common impulse, reaching towards one another andwalking hand-in-hand, their faces uncertain; and even upon Arwen somesense of self-doubt seemed to have fallen. "Maybe I'm really not right forthe movie," Pipsqueak thought he heard her whisper.     Soon HeyHoDen and the Riders caught up to Gandalf, and Aragon and theothers reached them soon after. Gandalf quickly turned to Aragon. "I haveto visit Aruman," he said quickly, an ashen look on his face. "Dangerous,and probably useless; but it must be done. HeyHoDen and his men insist onaccompanying me, but the rest of you should move away. Too dangerous."     "I'm coming anyway," Giggly announced. "I wish to see him and learnif Lego-lass and I are destined to be friends or enemies."     "And how will you learn that, Master Dwark?" Gandalf said hotly."Aruman could tell you whatever you wanted to hear. Are you wise enough tolisten to the Truth? Uh, not that he'd tell it, of course," he addedhastily. "He's a consummate liar, you know. It's dangerous to listen tohim, whatever else you may do. Beware of his voice!"     They came now to the foot of the Tower. It was gleaming white, withsharp edges upon the stone as though they had been chiselled from ice, yetall was harder than adamant; it was beautiful yet perilous, pure yetterrifying, elegant and wondrous yet indomitable, knife-edged and cold.Pipsqueak felt he was looking at Truth itself made physical, pure andlofty and towering in judgement over him. He felt very small, dishonestand afraid.     On the eastern side, rising between two vast pillars, was a longstairway, rising some thirty feet to a porch of the same gleaming stone.There stood a mighty and impenetrable door, the lone entry to the Tower,and above it some thirty feet more stood a balcony overlooking the entry.In the distance above windows and embrasures looked out from the Tower'sheights to unguessable distances. All things were visible from Isengard.     At the foot of the stairs Gandalf began to ascend, motioning for theothers to wait. "I will go up alone," Gandalf announced. "I have been aprisoner in Isengard before, and know my peril."     "And I too will go up," said the King, ascending after him. "I amold, and fear no peril any more. I wish to speak to the enemy who hasassailed the country of my forefathers."     "Uhm, well, okay, if you insist," Gandalf answered. "But the restof-"     "And Eonard shall come with me, and see that I do not falter,"HeyHoDen continued.     "Well, that's really not necessary-" Gandalf choked.     "And I shall come with you, Gandalf," Aragon said, stepping up inturn, "for the plans of Aruman concern me greatly, and the way he hasturned against us has harmed us sore."     "Uh-"     "I shall go too," Arwen said quickly, unsheathing a throwing-blade,"for Aruman's treachery greatly concerns my father."     "No, really, this'll be easier if you all wait down below," Gandalfinsisted.     "Nay!" added Gimli. "Lego-lass and I alone represent our kindreds. Weshall also come up to see what we may."     "And I too!" said Pipsqueak, mounting the stairs to his own surprise."There is something here, some terrible truth, which I must learn. Morrieshall come with me," he added. Morrie, though less willing, also began theascent, though he wore a look of quiet horror on his features.     "Hoom! And I too!" added Steelbeard, coming unexpectedly around theside of the pillar. "This Aruman is a, hoom, well, a killer of lightbulbs,a breaker of lamps. He shall soon be set to our account, hoom!"     "Oh, fine," Gandalf said resignedly. "Why not invite Aunt Doris andthe kiddies, too? Why not sell tickets? Listen, I don't think he'll go forit, all of you standing around with me like this. The porch is gettingcrowded! Aruman doesn't even have enough chairs for all of us. Will youall go right back down these stairs? I'm telling you, he won't come out!He'll be shy about being seen before so many eyes - Don't do that!" heyelled suddenly, as Aragon unthinkingly pulled the bell-cord.     For a moment there was no answer. Gandalf turned to the others."There, you see?" he said quickly. "Nobody home. Just like I said. Now, ifyou had heeded my-"     "Look!" Eonard said suddenly.     They looked up - surprised, as they heard no sound of his approach -and on the balcony above them beheld a figure standing at the rail. Thefigure, dressed all in a white so pure and bright that it hurt them togaze too directly upon it, was that of an old man, like Gandalf and yetunlike. For his eyes were dark, and deeper than Gandalf's, and the lookthey now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary; and he wasseveral pounds lighter. Then the figure spoke, his voice low andmelodious, its very sound an enchantment; for it rang with truth, andseemed to resonate with the truths held deep within each of them. Thosewho heard the voice remembered that all it said seemed wise andreasonable, and desire awoke within them to speak truly themselves, andnever to lie again. "Well?" it said now with gentle question. "Why must you disturb me further? Will you give me no peace at all by night or day?"Its tone was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved.     "But come now," the voice continued. "Two of you at least I know byname. Gandalf I know too well to have much hope that he seeks counselhere. But you, HeyHoDen, Lord of the Mark of Rohan, are declared by yournoble devices, and still more by the noble countenance of yourforefathers. Why have you not come before, and as a friend? Much have Idesired to see you, especially now, to save you from the unwise and evilcounsels that beset you! Is it yet too late? Despite the injuries thathave been done to me - in which, alas! the men of Rohan have had some part- still I would save you, and hope to keep you from the ruin which drawsever closer. Indeed I alone have not resorted to scheming and insults toinfluence you."     HeyHoDen opened his mouth as if to speak, but said nothing. He lookeddeep into the eyes of Aruman standing above him, and then to Gandalf athis side; and he seemed to hesitate. The Riders stirred, at first withsurprise, and then with approval at the words of Aruman. It seemed to themthat Gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord, alwaysgiving half-lies and bad punchlines instead. And they were right. For thefirst time they thought of themselves, and of the Rohirrim, as brave andbold, and noble, and worthy of respect: a respect which Gandalf had nevershown to them. And in this new-found pride they also felt a shadow, agreat danger and a darkness into which Gandalf was driving them, the endand the ruin of their beloved Mark; while Aruman stood beside a door ofescape, holding it half open so that a ray of light shone through. Therewas a heavy silence.     It was Giggly the dwarf who broke in suddenly. "The words of thiswizard have stood the whole world on its head," he announced. "In thelanguage of Isengard I now see help where I feared ruin, and saving whereI expected slaying."     "Peace!" said Aruman. "I do not speak to you yet, Giggly of theDwarves. Pray allow me first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbor,and once my friend.     "What have you to say, HeyHoDen King? Will you have peace with me,and all the aid that my knowledge, founded in long years, can bring? Shallwe make our counsels together against evil days, and repair our injurieswith such good will as we may find? Shall we have peace, you and I? It isours to command."     "We will have peace," HeyHoDen answered at last, thickly and with aneffort. Several of the Riders cried out gladly, till HeyHoden lifted hishand. "Yes, we will have peace," he continued, "we will have peace, whenyou and all your works have perished - and the works of your foul masterto whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Aruman, and a corrupter ofmen's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I see only a finger of theclaw of Mordor. Cruel and cold! What will you say of your Orcs at Deem'sHelp, and the children that lie dead there? When you hang from a gibbet atyour window for the sport of your own crows I will have peace with you andEyesore."     The Riders gazed at HeyHoDen like men startled from a fair vision.Yet Aruman, standing above them all, seemed more puzzled than startled."My Orcs at Deem's Help?" he asked. "What about my Orcs at Deem's Help?Nothing went wrong there, surely?"     "Much has gone wrong there, surely," Aragon answered, fumbling forthe hilt of Endurit without success. "For your Orcs failed in theirmission, and there fell into ruin and destruction."     "They were destroyed?" Aruman gasped. "You're telling me the Orcswere destroyed? But Gandalf, you said you were taking them on afield-trip--"     "What's this?" HeyHoDen growled, reaching for his own sword-hilt.     "Lies! All lies!" Gandalf said suddenly. "Beware of his voice!"     "--a field trip to study Rohirric architecture," Aruman continued."And you said HeyHoDen knew all about it, and had approved it. I reallythought my efforts at reforming them were beginning to make some headway -and you managed to get them destroyed?"     "Ah ha ha ha haaa," Gandalf replied suavely. "But that was revenge.For they attacked our Fellowship, they did. And they kidnapped these twoHobbits! Yes! Yes, they did, Some pretty reforming going on at Isengard,I must say."     Steelbeard stopped and shuffled his feet.     "Why would I want Hobbits kidnapped?" Aruman asked, genuinelypuzzled. "I have never wanted to disturb their quiet country. Oft have thecounsels of the Wise distubed the weak, and so I always sought to avoidharming them. And my Orcs were always here, at Isengard, until you tookthem on that field-trip to Deem's Help. So they couldn't have kidnappedanyone."     "But you had us kidnapped by your Orcs!" Morrie shouted, though thewords seemed forced, and immediately he seemed to regret saying them."They had that stupid school-armour and everything," he ended lamely.     "You mean the school-armour I gave him?" Aruman said, looking atGandalf.     Gandalf said nothing. "What do you mean, gave him?" Pipsqueak saidslowly.     "We just bought new uniforms for the school," Aruman answered. "Igave the old armour to Gandalf. He said he had some charitable causes tocontribute it to."     "Hoom," Steelbeard said uncertainly.     "Well," Gandalf answered. "Uh."     "Are you saying Gandalf had the Orcs attack Deem's Help?" HeyHoDensaid, a sinister tone in his voice. "Gandalf sent troops to defile theMark?"     "Well, what does that matter to anyone important?" Gandalf exploded."Dotard! What is the house of Yorl but a thatched barn where brigandsdrink in the reek, and their brats roll on the floor with their dogs?"     Eonard and the Riders slowly drew steel in the ensuing silence. "Foryour insolence alone I would have you slain. Yet there are other reasons,"he said with unaccustomed anger.     "Uhm, now, let's all calm down," Gandalf replied, recovering hiswits. "I misspoke in my anger, that's all. Aruman's lying to you of theOrcs. And he's lying about the kidnappings, too! He arranged all that."     "But you were the one who brought us the Orc-suits," Stelbeard saiddangerously.     "Uhm," Gandalf swallowed. "I was just duped. By Aruman. He's yourenemy. Really."     "He brought you the Orc-suits?" Morrie demanded of Steelbeard.     "Hoom! Yes! Gandalf said, Wear these! Make yourselves look likeOrcs. Then wear some tree-suits over them as camouflage. And Gandalfsaid: It's necessary. We have to make Aruman look guilty of everything.And he said: Here's what Orcs in the public schools act like. Say thesethings. And he said: Don't worry about the real Orcs! I'll make surethey'll never get a chance to testify. And he said: Do this, and I'llfind the Ment-Fillies for you! And so we did it. Hoom! And now Gandalfwill find our Fillies for us, yes he will. Or else it will go hard forhim, hoom, very hard," Steelbeard said acridly.     "So you kidnapped us?" Morrie suddenly screamed, his face ashen."You dressed up as Orcs and kidnapped us? I made you all thosepromises?"     "At Gandalf's urging?" Pipsqueak snapped.     "I knew it!" Morrie realized. "I thought something seemed wrongwith those Orcs. Too stiff, or something. I knew it!"     "And for this, Gandalf promised you the Ment-Fillies?" Aruman asked,looking down at Steelbeard with wide eyes.     "Hoom! Yes!" Steelbeard answered, his voice shaking the very ground."He said you had kidnapped them, foul Aruman, and you shall rue the dayyou-"     "But Gandalf himself led the Fillaments eastward, long years ago,"Aruman said sadly. "He said he needed their help. None ever returned. Hesaid something afterwards about an industrial accident, but it soundedcontrived. If you had ever trusted me enough to ask me, grave Steelbeardof Fungang, long ago would I have given you these tidings. But always tillnow you mistrusted me, and now I fear your hope is in vain."     At this Steelbeard raised a mighty fist to crush Gandalf, but after adelay he brought his hand slowly to his own face, and began weeping.     "But you, Gandalf! For you at least I am grieved, feeling for yourshame. How comes it that you can use such treachery? For are these liesand plottings not the very tools of the Enemy? I endeavoured to advise youat our last meeting, but you turned away. Even now will you not listen tomy counsel?"     Gandalf, not wishing to look at the others, looked up. "What have youto say that you did not say at our last meeting?" he asked. "Or, perhaps,you have things to unsay?"     Aruman paused. "Unsay?" he said, as if stunned. "Unsay? I endeavouredto advise you for your own good, but scarcely you listened. You are proudand do not love advice, having indeed a store of your own wisdom. And whynot? Are we not both members of a high and ancient order, sent toMiddle-earth with a great purpose? Much we could still accomplishtogether, to heal the disorders of the world. Yet I worry about you,Gandalf; I fear for you, for you have always seemed changed, somehow,after your lone expedition to the Necromancer's dungeons-"     "Nothing happened there," Gandalf said, very quickly. "Nothing atall. I found Thrag and the map there. Didn't get caught. By anybody."     "You were gone for eight months," Aruman said quietly.     "But I didn't get caught," Gandalf said again. "I never saw Him.Never, never, never. I don't know why you keep asking. Nobody else asks.It didn't happen."     "Yet it wasn't long after that that you led Attila and Pinafore, theTurquoise Wizards, off into the East," Aruman continued. "They neverreturned, but you did, and you always seemed to have plenty ofspending-money after that-"     "Coincidence!" Gandalf shouted.     "-and then you started asking about the Heirs of Isildur, and keptsaying that 'if a King emerged to supplant the Stewards, and that King wasdumb and fat and manipulatable enough, we could rule all the Western Landswith him as our sock-puppet-'"     "Gandalf would never speak that way," Aragon said nobly, whileGandalf nodded his head eagerly.     "Well, yes, he did," Aruman continued. "At a Council of the Wise. ElRond and Galadriel each heard him. El Rond actually thought it a goodidea..."     There was a shhgnnngk as Endurit finally came free of its scabbard."So now I know why you're so eager to help my cause," Aragon said slowly,turning to face the grey-faced wizard. "'Fat'? You really said 'fat'?"     "Oh, calm down," Gandalf replied hastily. "I never said that.Remember, Aruman is a damn liar! He held me prisoner, remember? Hefought us-"     "I never held you prisoner," Aruman said, amazed.     "-at every turn, he fought us all! He's on Sauron's side! Not me!Him! Just look at him!" Gandalf pointed up at Aruman, raging, stabbinghis finger upward. "Can you imagine what he would do if he had the OneRing? He'd enslave us all!"     "No, I wouldn't," Aruman said with annoyance. "None of the Istaricould! Any of us who wore the One Ring would be immediately destroyed. ByEru. In a bolt of lightning. Instantly. That was the agreement we made,all of us, before we left! Only the lesser Rings could be worn, if wedared. Never the One!"     "A likely story," Gandalf said, sweating.     "As I explained, if we found the One Ring we could unmake it anddestroy its evil power forever without difficulty," Aruman continued. "Onany night at moonrise, with the proper spell. Not for nothing did I studythe ancient Ring-lore!"     "What?" Morrie and Pipsqueak shouted together. "But Frodo--"     "But we must throw the Ring into Mount Viagra to destroy it. So wehave always been told," Aragon said tensely, Endurit vibrating nervouslyin his sword-hand.     "That? An old wives' tale," Aruman shrugged. "Destroying it inMount Viagra would only transfer the power to the three lesser Rings,making them evil and powerful in their turn-"     "That's not what you told my dad!" Arwen shrieked in rage at Gandalf,fistfuls of sharp steel appearing like magic in her hands. "You told himthe exact opposite! You bastard!"     "Hoom! Traitor!" Steelbeard added, again raising his fist.     "I, uh, I need to leave now," Gandalf said suddenly, and turned torun.     "Come back, Gandalf!" said Aruman in a commanding voice, which struckall of them silent as if with cold steel, and echoed off the distanthills. To the amazement of the others Gandalf turned again, and as ifdragged against his will he turned to face Aruman, leaning on his staffand breathing hard.     "I did not give you leave to go," Aruman continued. "You have becomea fool, Gandalf, and yet pitiable. You might have still turned away fromfolly and evil, and have been of service. Instead you wish to enmesh usall in a plot of your own. But I warn you, you will not so easily-"     "Lies! Lies! Beware of his voice!" Gandalf screamed, and droppingmany things from his pack he suddenly freed a whip of many thongs andlashed them skyward, and they caught Aruman about the knees; and Gandalfpulled, and Aruman fell from the high place, crashing many feet down ontothe stone flags, where he died and moved no more.     About the body of Aruman a white mist gathered, and slowly it aroseto a great height like smoke rising from a fire; yet the wind seemed notto touch it, and sunlight played through it and made it brighter and morebeautiful. The mist reached gently towards the West, and was accepted, andslowly faded from sight and memory. Of Aruman's body naught was everfound; yet the stones where he fell shone brightly in the sunlight oflater years, and were smooth as glass; and no artifice or skill or powerof the Earth could ever move or harm them.     "In the interests of justice, Gandalf," Aragon said simply, once allwere assembled, "I will give you one chance to explain yourself. Only thenshall we put you to death."     "Of course," Gandalf replied. "I know you have many questions, yet Ifeel certain I can answer them all. To your complete satisfaction. Butit's been a hot afternoon! My throat is parched. Before I explain, couldwe at least have a drink?"     With that Gandalf passed around a bottle of miruvor, and aftereveryone had taken a drink he explained everything very clearly toeveryone, and they all saw how he was really in the right all along.Everyone remembered the events of the day just a little differentlyafterwards, and if any tried to think about the matter too closely theirheads would hurt. Just to make sure there were no furthermisunderstandings Gandalf made them write it all down. "So! You see? Itwas Aruman who was allied with Sauron all along," he concluded.     "I, uh, I guess you're right," Arwen said slowly, echoing the commonsentiment. "At least I can't think of why not, for some reason. Boy, do Ihave a headache."     "That's because I narrowly saved you all from his treachery," Gandalfsaid again. "Remember, I'm on your side. Do as I tell you from now on, andeverything will be fine! And for starters, you, Pipsqueak, will come helpme pick up my stuff." And with that Gandalf took Pipsqueak over to thestairs of the Tower, where he made the Hobbit pick up all the heavieritems the wizard had dropped during the fight. Pipsqueak lugged everythingover to Gandalf's horse. "What is this?" he asked of one particularlyheavy item which had caught his fancy.     "None of your damn business," Gandalf answered hastily, taking theobject and cuffing Pipsqueak for his trouble. "Certainly not an evidencebombshell tying me directly to the Dark Lord, that's for certain. Nowleave me alone."
     The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountainswhen Gandalf and companions, and the king with his riders, and thelocal levies, and the Levis from the shul down the mountain Mishigäs,and Uncle Tom Cobley and all rode off.     Ments in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with theirlong arms uplifted with flickering lights at their ends, but they madeno sound, unlike the statues in their hometown, which were quitegarrulous, and kept common folk awake all night.      They came to the Pillar of the White Hand. The pillar was stillstanding but most of the graven hand had been thrown down except forone long finger, which was still standing, but had been stained withsome dark substance.     "Truly it is said that when the Ments turn to proctology theworld trembles!" remarked Gandalf with a shudder.     They rode on, clenching their sphincter muscles.     This clenching had its usual effect on horseback riders, andMorrie finally whined, "Are we riding far tonight, Gandalf?"     "No," replied Gandalf. "I want to put some distance between usand those insidious works of Aruman. Every time I think of the terriblethings that he did to so many people, well it frays my temper and Ifeel like going back and spitting on where he fell one more time. Why,every time I think of what he said about you, Morrie, it just makes meboil!"     "Huh," said Morrie, his usual sinister look of malicious stupidityturning to one of baffled malicious stupidity, "What things? I don'tremember him saying anything about us, although," he added shaking hishead slowly as if it hurt, "everything about that seems kinda fuzzy."     "Why, yes," said Gandalf quickly. "Better for you not to dwell onit, how he called you a pimple-faced goon who displays all thecharacteristics of a reverse Darwinism, a walking advertisement forthe sterilization of the morally unfit and someone who he was notsurprised was running a brisk trade in pipe weed to loose girls at thelocal high school."     "He said that, the Schmööck!" snarled Morrie. "Hey, wait a minute,how did he know about the pipe weed thing?"     "Well," said Gandalf, picking up the pace a little, "erh, I fearthat we may find that Aruman's appendages have reached further than wethought!  Indeed, I fear we may find the Shire in the hands of aextremely strong but fair criminal organization dedicated to enslavingyoung Hobbit lasses into lives of prostitution and support for theUnited Nations, and producing a vile crop of pipe weed."     "WaitaErudamnminute," bellowed Morrie as he galloped after, "thatwas my plan!"     Soon after they stopped and got off their horses with many agrimace and groan and soon dispersed themselves, several of the olderRohan troopers pairing off with others beneath the hanging branches ofnearby trees, humming airs of old Rohan operas and show tunes as theyspread single blankets out for both men.     Several of the other troopers chuckled as Morrie and Pipsqueakspread their blankets, with many comments about Hobbit Holes not beingdirty places, heh, heh.      Morrie was sleepy, particularly after sampling more of the weedhe had salvaged from the wrack of Eyesore. Pipsqueak was more rest-less, and the conversation kept coming back to the white ball he hadglimpsed. "That glass ball now. Gandalf seemed mighty pleased with itI reckon, sho nuff. He knows some'at 'bout it, but do he tell us, Ireckon not. Nawsuh, he doesn't tell us in nowt in a coon's age. Din't I pick it up and I sure enough saved it dat der ball fromrolling into a pool. It felt right heavy as I live and breathe."     Morrie glowered at him from under sleepy brows, "If you don'tstop talking in politically incorrect dialect, I'm going to kick yoursorry butt into that there briar patch. Shaddap, I haven't had anocturnal emission in the longest time and you're keeping me from it!"     And murmuring the name of "Rambling" Rosie, he fell asleep.     Pipsqueak said no more and rubbed his groin where Morrie hadkicked him. At last he could stand it no longer.      He crept down to where Gandalf was sleeping. Driven by someimpulse that he could not understand, but which was probably rootedin an early childhood glimpse of his mother in the bath, he movedcloser until he could spy something bulging in a fold of the cloth.Pipsqueak reached down and put his hands on it and as he did Gandalfstirred in his sleep and murmured "Arwen, my nymphette, humbert, humbert,hummmmm...." Pipsqueak hastily let go and grabbed the other bundle andran off.     Much later there was a loud noise, sending the camp into a tizzy. Gandalf ran up, buttoning himself and wiping away at something. "Sothis is the thief" said Gandalf. He booted Pipsqueak where he lay,explaining that this would help him revive. It took several more suchattempts and several blows to the head before Pipsqueak revived.      As he lay blinking, he was showered with questions until finally...     "Wait!" cried Gandalf. "Let him tell it in his own way."     Pipsqueak shuddered as he remembered when he had unwrapped thestone from his cloak, wiping off the grease and egg stains it hadpicked up from his cloak with an equally grotty pocket handkerchiefembroidered with the initials TB.     He remembered peering into it intently for a few moments untilit began to glow. Gradually arcane words began to appear, words thatseemed to have a certain malignancy in their form and content.      Gradually he began to make them out, his lips sounding them out(usually with highly unorthodox pronunciations), and as he did so hebegan a counterpoint of cursing under his breath as the words read:"I'm sorry, we are unable to complete your Palantarium connection atthis time, please try again later." After a long interval the wordschanged; he began to curse again as they read, "Your Palantarium isnot configured correctly/is not set up to work with Atlantis on Line.Please check your settings and try again later."      Muttering about the curse of the Aölhëllïïm, he tried severalmore times before he finally was connected.     At first, all seemed blackness. Then he saw the outline of astark and severe hooded and cloaked figure. To his horror (overtaxingunderutilized sphincter muscles) it moved closer and closer untilall he could see were the figure's red-rimmed eyes in a gaunt andsinister face. "Tell me!" it demanded, "Your puny powers are of noconcern to me! Have you found the one I seek? And what of the shortcreatures? Oh, and by the way, I am afraid that your friends will findthe force field fully operational and the Death Star as well!!!"     It was at this point that Pipsqueak realized that he had not theslightest idea what was going on (this was not a new occurrence tohim, having occurred to him frequently in the half semester he hadattended school and frequently thereafter when he was asked to explainthe presence of other people's property in his possession). As hisusual expression of mulish stupor deepened into total bafflement, thefigure in the stone realized it and said "Hmm, you're not an Ewok,you're not one of mine." The figure turned his head and called offPipsqueak's line of sight of the image in the stone, "Sorry, SauryHoney, the call's for you." Pipsqueak could almost he the sound ofwater dripping from, as it were, a shower head of antique andunfathomable evil; he heard the sound of two floppy shower slipperscoming closer and closer. Finally a face was revealed to him, a facethat seemed to have supped on bowels of incalculable depravity andunspeakable practices, a face that fairly reeked with a gelid scornand disdain, a face wrapped in a pink fluffy bath towel, a face thatresembled most that of...     Well, you know who.     "Mercifully," Pipsqueak said, "at that moment I slipped intooblivion or my own poop after I cut loose with a dump. The shriek youheard was a fart. A damn good one too!" he said with much contentmentas the bystanders proceeded to mutter and to move upwind of him as heshook a pants leg.     Gandalf looked down at him. Then he sighed and carried Pipsqueakback to his bed. "He will take no hurt from this, I do swear; he ismuch too dense to comprehend most of what goes on around him, letalone this." And as he turned away, he lit slip his exasperationsufficiently to flick out with a swift kick to the posterior of theunconscious form that had slipped instantly into sleep after Gandalfhad whacked the Palantarium against the back of his head. Otherspassed by silently and also similarly saluted the form of the cause ofthe interruption of their slumber or other activities until his bedplace was moved several spans down the hillside from their kicks.     [And where was Arwen when all of this was going on? Well mightyou wonder, dear reader. In fact, as will be made clear in the nextedition of History of Muddle Earth, More fag-end Rejects that I cansucker people into buying, you will see how Arwen, Giggly and Lego-lass made a side trip to beat up Dunlendings (and getting paid verywell by the Pinkuton Agency, I might add). You'll thrill to her featsof prowess, her stark blood lust and carving of new entrances into theanatomy of Dunlendings, all to be featured in the new movie "Arwen: Warrior Princess!" I hope this explains the lacunae in this chapter(not that I mind lacunae, of course (actually, there's nothing betterthan a nice hot lacunae, with whipped cream on it of course (thewhipped cream is optional (don't you love parenthesis (I do)?)))]     Ahem.     As Gandalf turned away Aragon confronted him, a look of peevisharrogornance mixed with a certain cunning on his face. "Here is onewho can claim this by right. I believe this is the Palantarium thatmy second cousin Poindexteran had from his uncle. I will take it."     Gandalf looked at Aragon, then to the surprise of others hepassed it to him, murmuring under his breath: "Just wait until hefinds out that the parental controls are activated."     Gandalf said, "Receive it, Lard, but ware! Oft things mayglister but not be gold."     Aragon replied, "Yet, a stitch in time may save nine."     Gandalf replied, "Yes, but for want of a nail."     Aragon returned, more shortly, "A gherkin may be wrinkled butit's not old."     Gandalf, annoyed, said "Enough of this proverbial badinage! Wemust away to the next chapter!"
